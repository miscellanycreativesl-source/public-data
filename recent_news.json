  'headline': "EU agrees to designate Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps as terrorist group",
  'summary': ['At a Brussels meeting on January 29, 2026, the 27‑nation bloc unanimously designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation, placing it alongside al‑Qaeda, ISIS and Hamas, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas confirmed.',
   'A brutal crackdown earlier this month prompted momentum for the listing as HRANA verified 6,373 deaths and the Basij force intensified repression after Jan. 8, 2026 internet cuts.',
   'The designation triggers EU asset freezes and related restrictive measures, while sanctions target 15 individuals and six entities including IRGC senior officials, and expand powers to detain IRGC members in the 27-nation bloc.',
   "France's late reversal on January 28 cleared the path to consensus, while Tehran warned of 'destructive consequences' and Ellie Geranmayeh said, 'Economically, this move will have a very nominal impact at this current stage.'",
   'Kaja Kallas said diplomatic channels should remain open even after the listing, which aligns the EU with the United States, Canada and Australia amid Strait of Hormuz security concerns.'],
  'bias': ['Left-Leaning outlets frame the EU\'s designation of Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard as a "decisive step" against "brutal repression," emphasizing the moral imperative and high protest death tolls, sometimes citing "perhaps 30,000" killed.',
   'Right-Leaning coverage portrays the IRGC as "murderous" and a "state in the state," often comparing it to groups like ISIS, highlighting the EU\'s "policy reversal" to send an "unequivocal message.',
   'Center-Leaning reports, conversely, frequently qualify the move as "largely symbolic," while detailing specific figures like "6,300" deaths and Iran\'s counter-threat to label EU forces as terrorists.',
   'All perspectives agree on the designation and Iran\'s warnings of "crushing response" or "hazardous consequences," underscoring shared geopolitical concerns despite differing ideological priorities.'],

   'Amid a winter offensive targeting energy and rail infrastructure, the strikes came days after peace negotiators held talks aimed at ending the nearly four-year war.',
