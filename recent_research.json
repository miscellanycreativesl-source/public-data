    "Abstract": "Importance The requirement for in-person, often daily, attendance at opioid treatment programs (OTPs) makes travel times a barrier to methadone treatment. Research on methadone accessibility has primarily focused on travel via personal vehicle, and there is uncertainty about public transit travel time to methadone treatment. Objective To estimate travel time via personal vehicle vs public transit to methadone treatment in the state of Connecticut. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study included geospatial analysis of median travel time to nearest OTP via personal vehicle and public transit from all census block groups (CBGs). This study took place in the state of Connecticut in 2023. Participants were all CBGs in Connecticut. Exposures Participants were characterized by racial and ethnic demographics; household income; car ownership; urban, suburban, or rural designations; and per-capita opioid overdose deaths. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was the median travel time to nearest OTP by via personal vehicle and public transit. Spatial error models using k -nearest neighbor spatial weight matrices were estimated to assess the associations between sociodemographic characteristics and travel times for each transportation mode (personal vehicle vs public transit) at the CBG level. Results From the centroids of the 2702 CBGs in Connecticut, the median (IQR) travel time to the closest OTP was 11.0 (7.5-16.3) minutes by personal vehicle and 41.7 (31.0-49.5) minutes via public transit, with 1431 CBGs (53%) lacking access to public transit or having high public transit times (&amp;amp;gt;60 minutes or no trip available). Travel times via public transit increased along the urban-rural gradient and across CBGs with an increasing percentage of non-Hispanic White residents. Median (IQR) travel times to an OTP from the 489 CBGs with the highest per-capita overdose death rates were 8.2 (5.9-11.7) minutes by personal vehicle and 37.6 (27.8-48.5) minutes by public transit, with 166 (34%) lacking public transit access. Conclusions and Relevance The findings of this cross-sectional study of barriers to access to methadone treatment suggest that areas with high overdose death rates, low car ownership, and high public transit travel times should be targets for interventions (eg, mobile services or greater use of take-home doses for patients) to lower travel-based barriers to methadone. Current federal statutes and regulations governing methadone provision are the greatest barrier, as they directly require often daily transit to opioid treatment clinics. Reducing this barrier requires policy changes.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Functional elastic cartilage remains an unmet challenge in regenerative medicine, limiting reconstructive options for children born with microtia, the congenital malformation of the auricle. The current gold standard treatment relies on harvesting rib cartilage, an invasive procedure associated with donor site morbidity, impaired aesthetics, and unnaturally stiff ears due to the use of hyaline cartilage. Here, we engineered primary human auricular chondrocytes to generate functional elastic cartilage with near‐native tissue properties. This was achieved through the synergistic integration of growth factor‐controlled chondrogenesis, stress‐relaxing biomaterials that promote elastic cartilage formation, and a bioreactor platform enabling homogeneous tissue maturation. The engineered grafts exhibited a uniform extracellular matrix composition with elastin, glycosaminoglycans, and collagen II comparable to native auricular cartilage, while lacking the fibrocartilage marker collagen I. The resulting tissue achieved a compressive modulus of 1.1 ± 0.03 MPa, matching native cartilage (1.0 ± 0.1 MPa), and maintained its structural integrity and elasticity in vivo for 6 weeks in a subcutaneous rat model. These grafts represent the closest replication of native human elastic cartilage achieved ex vivo to date, establishing a foundation for clinically viable, functional auricular grafts.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Treatment of oily wastewater generated from industrial and human activities (particularly oil recovery processes) remains a long‐standing global challenge. Oily residues (e.g., emulsified oil and fine solids) in the wastewater readily foul and block water‐treatment equipment and downstream units, thereby reducing treatment efficiency and increasing operational and maintenance costs. Here, we report a molecularly engineered triblock polymer (denoted as PHZ) that markedly suppresses oil fouling under different conditions. PHZ comprises cationic, hydrophobic, and zwitterionic blocks, which enable its rapid adsorption onto diverse substrates and foulants, followed by reorganization into a hydration‐rich interfacial layer. Upon adsorption, PHZ molecules reduce the interfacial water contact angle from ≈110° to ≈20° and generate strong steric repulsion between foulants and substrates, providing both energy and physical barriers to mitigate fouling. The resulting PHZ layer prevents direct contact between foulants and target substrates, achieving ≈49% reduction in oil fouling even at an ultralow dosage (e.g., 20 ppm) and outperforming leading commercial antifouling reagents. The combined rapid adsorption, robust interfacial hydration, strong suppression of hydrophobic attractions, and generation of steric repulsions establish a mechanistic basis for PHZ as an efficient fouling‐resistant additive and provide design principles for next‐generation chemicals and materials for diverse industrial water treatment processes.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Critical‐sized maxillofacial bone defects remain a major clinical challenge due to the limited osteoinductive capacity of existing biomaterials. While cell adhesion is recognized as an initiating event in bone regeneration, how adhesive interactions integrate biochemical and mechanical cues to regulate osteogenic commitment remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the synergistic coupling of mechanical stimulation (MS) and icariin (ICA) promotes osteogenic differentiation through the integrin β 1 /β‐actin/YAP signaling axis. By combining single‐cell adhesion force measurements using a robotic micro‐operating system with biomimetic three‐dimensional scaffolds, we show that MS‐ICA coupling enhances osteoblast adhesion, induces actin cytoskeletal remodeling, and facilitates YAP nuclear translocation, thereby activating osteogenic gene expression. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of integrin β 1 , β‐actin, or YAP abrogated the pro‐osteogenic effects, confirming their essential roles in this mechanotransductive pathway. In a rabbit mandibular defect model, ICA‐functionalized scaffolds under physiological loading significantly accelerated bone regeneration. Collectively, these results elucidate a mechanistic link between cell adhesion and lineage specification and establish a design principle for biomaterials that integrate mechanical and biochemical regulation to enhance bone regeneration.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 27%, but further improvements of both PCEs and stability are needed for commercialization. One of the key factors hindering their development is the unpredictable residual strain in perovskites. The unstable octahedral structure of the perovskite cage leads to easy changes in bond lengths, bond angles, and crystal structure. It in turn generates, accumulates, and causes the non‐uniform distribution of residual strain, ultimately affecting device performance. Therefore, given the versatility and precise tunability, residual strain engineering provides an effective pathway to optimize the performance of PSCs. This review summarizes the causes of residual strain during device fabrication and operation, qualitative/quantitative/auxiliary characterization methods, and various effective strain regulation methods in the past two years. Finally, unresolved scientific issues and future research directions in strain engineering are discussed. This comprehensive review aims to provide researchers with the latest advances in strain engineering, deepen fundamental understanding of strain effects, and eventually help enhance the performance of PSCs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Rechargeable Li─Cl 2 batteries represent a promising high‐energy‐density technology. However, the open‐pore structure of conventional cathode materials poses a fundamental challenge by permitting the uncontrolled diffusion of Cl 2 into the electrolyte, resulting in severe local concentration dilution that plagues rate capability and specific capacity. Herein, a self‐confinement strategy by hollow carbon nanoreactors (HCNRs) is proposed to regulate the local concentration of active Cl 2 species with micropores (≈0.8 nm) on their walls. These micropores act as size‐selective barriers, allowing to block the escape of larger active Cl 2 species (kinetic diameter ≈0.86 nm), and mesopores (30–50 nm) function as nanoreactors that concentrate active Cl 2 species. This design enables the as‐assembled Li─Cl 2 cell to achieve an ultrahigh current density of 100 mA cm −2 during the charge/discharge process and a record‐breaking specific capacity of 8000 mAh g −1 (9 mAh cm −2 ), superior to the reported literature. This hollow nanoreactor design highlights the potential of Li─Cl 2 batteries as high‐power and energy‐dense systems, paving the way for their practical application.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aqueous zinc‐iodine batteries are promising contenders for next‐generation grid‐scale energy storage batteries. However, their deployment is hindered by zinc anode degradation at moderate cycling rates (0.5–2 C), including dendrite growth and parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), stemming from an unstable Zn/electrolyte interphase. Herein, a sugar alcohol‐based multifunctional additive of mannitol (ML), identified via theoretical screening based on molecular characteristics of electrostatic polarity, H 2 O binding energy, and LUMO level, is proposed to achieve comprehensive Zn/electrolyte interphase stabilization from the bulk phase to the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP). Leveraging abundant hydroxyl groups and good Zn 2+ affinity, ML disrupts the bulk hydrogen‐bond network and reconstructs Zn 2+ solvation structure, simultaneously suppressing proton‐hopping pathways and accelerating Zn 2+ desolvation. Moreover, robust chemisorption of ML molecules on both Zn (002) and Zn (101) planes modulates Zn deposition toward the thermodynamically stable (002) texture with enlarged grain size, thereby enabling dendrite‐free plating. Benefiting from these synergistic effects, Zn||I 2 full cells achieve an ultrahigh areal capacity of 6.5 mAh cm −2 over 3000 cycles at a practical rate of 1 C. Multiple Ah‐level Zn||I 2 pouch cells are also demonstrated, sustaining 1000 cycles with only 0.02% capacity decay per cycle, underscoring strong prospects for practical large‐scale application.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Sodium‐metal batteries (SMBs) have attracted considerable interest due to their abundant raw material supply and high energy density. Nevertheless, realizing fast charging and long‐term cycling stability over a wide temperature range remains a considerable challenge. In this work, we propose a novel strategy that integrates molecular anchoring with weak solvation by modulating the dipole‐dipole interactions between methyl propionate (MP) and fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC). This approach effectively stabilizes the free solvent ratio, suppresses the irregular dendrite formation under low‐temperature and fast‐charging conditions, and minimizes HF generation at elevated temperatures, thereby enhancing electrolyte chemical stability and Na + desolvation kinetics. These synergistic enhancements enable rapid Na + transport and facilitate the formation of a robust interface layer across a broad temperature range. Consequently, Na 3 V 2 (PO 4 ) 3 ||Na cells demonstrate stable operation from −40°C to 70°C and sustain over 10 000 cycles at 80°C, outperforming previous reports on wide‐temperature fast‐charging systems. Notably, the cells achieve a capacity retention of 98.58% after 1200 cycles at −20°C and 85.93% after 1500 cycles at 60°C. Moreover, pouch cells configured with this electrolyte exhibit superior all‐weather adaptability and fast‐charging capability.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Lithium incorporation into Cu 2 ZnSn(S,Se) 4 (CZTSSe) absorbers has led to improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), often linked to changes in doping density and improvement in grain growth. In this study, we shed new light onto the influence of Li on CZTSSe absorbers, specifically on a transparent support, by investigating the effect of adding lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) from 0% to 5% Li/Cu ratios to molecular precursor solutions. Secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis confirmed both the uniform distribution of Li in annealed CZTSSe absorber, while there were also detectable changes to grain microstructure and surface electronic landscape. Upon the addition of 1% Li, the work function (WF) distribution, analysed by energy‐filtered photoemission electron microscopy, broadens significantly from 85 to 200 meV, allowing for direct visualisation of the increase in surface electronic disorder of CZTSSe with Li incorporation for the first time. The Li additive was also found to induce the diffusion of Sn to the surface. A champion PCE of 5.07% was measured for F:SnO 2 (FTO)‐based CZTSSe with 1% Li, revealing the balance between microstructure, chemical disorder and Sn elemental distribution.

However, there remains a lack of comprehensive research on fundamental photonic integrated devices like grating couplers.

The simplified DNN model takes only 3 min to complete the training process on a home‐grade computer, facilitating efficient access to the predicted response spectra of the device. The trained DNN model has a custom hybrid error of less than 0.03, with a prediction accuracy as high as 0.95 within a precise range of ±0.02, while the maximum global error is below 0.04. Experimental validation of the DNN‐designed structure achieved a coupling efficiency of ‐5.5 dB at 445 nm with a −3 dB bandwidth of 13 nm, which is in good agreement with the simulation.

    "Abstract": "This article presents the design, characterization, and experimental validation of compliant pneumatic feet with online stiffness control for humanoid walking. The proposed feet are constructed using soft materials and integrated air chambers that enable real‐time stiffness modulation through pressure adjustment. A vision‐based control system performs terrain classification and enables predictive adaptation of foot compliance based on ground conditions. Compression and step‐response tests characterize the mechanical behavior and dynamic response of the pneumatic sole. The system can vary stiffness from 0 to over 1200 Nm/rad within 100 ms, which is fast enough for per‐step adaptation during locomotion. Walking experiments on flat and irregular carpeted floors demonstrate that variable‐stiffness feet improve balance, reduce impact forces, and produce smoother center of mass and zero moment point trajectories compared to rigid or passively compliant feet. Complementary simulations on outdoor‐like uneven terrains further confirm that adaptive stiffness control enhances stability and terrain robustness. Although validation is limited to controlled conditions, the results indicate that the proposed pneumatic architecture offers a lightweight and low‐power platform for real‐time compliance adaptation. The combination of modular design, sub‐200 ms response, and sensor‐driven stiffness control represents a step toward safe and versatile humanoid locomotion on unpredictable ground.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Microglia‐mediated neuroinflammation is closely associated with the pathogenesis of secondary brain injury following spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, the relationship between immune response regulation and metabolic patterns in microglia remains unclear. Histone Deacetylases 1 and 2, a class of lysine deacetylases, regulates gene transcription by modulating histone acetylation modifications and is widely involved in various cellular activities of microglia. In this study, we observed that knockout of HDAC1/2 in microglia alleviated neurological deficits caused by ICH, preserved white matter integrity, and accelerated hematoma clearance post‐ICH. Mechanistically, we found that after ICH, microglia exhibited increased expression of hexokinase 2 (HK2) and enhanced glycolysis. HDAC1/2 knockout/pharmacological inhibition affected the acetylation level of HK2, inhibited its glycolytic activity, and promoted a metabolic shift in activated microglia from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation. This shift was associated with reduced pro‐inflammatory responses and enhanced phagocytic activity in microglia. Enhanced fatty acid oxidation may have a detrimental effect on mitochondrial function, and HDAC1/2 inhibition simultaneously promoted mitophagy in microglia. Additionally, HDAC1/2 inhibition triggered microglial apoptosis and suppressed proliferation, ultimately leading to a reduction in microglial cell numbers. Overall, this study reveals the potential mechanisms by which targeting HDAC1/2, through acetylation modifications and transcriptional regulation, modulates microglial function and metabolism after ICH, thereby exerting protective effects.",

This study identifies Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) as a key protein responsible for sorting mRNAs into EVs. NPM1 achieves this by binding to specific RNA motifs, including those within mRNAs such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) , thereby initiating the formation of phase separation condensates containing intracellular RNA. These condensates are subsequently packaged into late endosomes and multivesicular bodies, facilitating their loading into EVs. Additionally, EVs derived from the serum of non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients exhibit elevated levels of NPM1 protein and EGFR mRNA, suggesting relevance for this transportation mechanism to NSCLC pathogenesis. This study, therefore, not only enhances the understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying mRNA sorting into EVs but also provides valuable insights for potential therapeutic strategies targeting NSCLC.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In the colonic mucosal tissues of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), the levels of resolvin D5 (RvD5), a specialized pro‐resolving mediator, are significantly reduced and negatively correlate with disease severity. Whether RvD5 can ameliorate UC remain unclear. Here, we show that exogenous supplement of RvD5 remarkably reduces neutrophil infiltration within the colonic mucosal epithelial layers and alleviates dextran sulfate sodium‐induced colitis in mice. Adoptive transfer of neutrophils significantly attenuates the alleviation of RvD5 against colitis, indicating that inhibition of neutrophil infiltration plays a crucial role in the anti‐colitis effect. Mechanistically, RvD5 activates GPR101 in colonic epithelial cells to selectively downregulate CXCL8 expression through inhibiting pSTAT1 expression and thereby suppressing neutrophil infiltration within colonic mucosal epithelial layer, and GPR101 knockdown attenuates the above‐mentioned effect of RvD5. Based on molecular docking screening from natural product library, epimedin A1 is identified as a novel enhancer of RvD5 biosynthesis in M2 macrophages, which functions through allosteric inhibition of 5‐lipoxygenase (5‐LOX). Epimedin A1 significantly elevates RvD5 levels in colonic tissue, suppresses CXCL8 expression in colonic epithelial cells, and reduces mucosal epithelial neutrophil infiltration in colitis mice. In summary, RvD5 and its biosynthesis promoter epimedin A1 are promising as therapeutic agents of UC.",

Here, we generate single‐cell transcriptomic atlases of 253,448 and 279,057 cells from 54 tissues in camels and cattle, discovering 124 cell types. Cross‐species comparisons at four developmental stages reveal a common evolutionary origin among camel glandular sac, third‐chambered stomach, and bovine abomasum, with the camel lineages uniquely harboring a cell population characterized by heightened expression of genes involved in cell proliferation. Also, the advantages of camel hepatocytes in prevention of excessive fat deposition are uncovered. Interestingly, the spatial transcriptomic analysis further reveals a unique population of S100A4 + vascular smooth muscle cells in camel rather than other mammalian kidneys, potentially involved in prevention of renal hypertension. Altogether, our study provides invaluable resources for evolutionary biology and highlights cellular innovations underlying mammalian adaptation.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In vivo generation of chimeric antigen receptor‐T (CAR‐T) cells offers an innovative approach to CAR‐T therapy; however, current in vivo CAR‐T technologies rely on synthetic carriers or viral particles, which raise immunogenicity and safety concerns in clinical applications. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell‐derived natural nano‐platforms with improved biocompatibility and the potential to deliver the transgene for in vivo CAR‐T generation. In this study, we pioneered a CD3ε nanobody (Nb)‐CD63 chimeric construct and stably expressed it on HEK‐293T cell‐derived EVs to produce CD3ε‐targeting EVs, which were further loaded with Nb‐CAR.BiTE (Nb‐CAR with secretable bispecific T‐cell engager) transgene through electroporation. The CD3ε‐Nb EVs selectively delivered Nb‐CAR.BiTE transgene into CD3 + cells in vivo and exerted robust antitumor activity against various solid tumors. The CD3‐targeting property of CD3ε‐Nb EVs combined with the characteristics of Nb‐CAR.BiTE construct may enhance memory CAR‐T proportion, prolong anti‐tumor immunity, and strengthen resilience against tumor antigen rechallenge. Notably, the CD3ε‐Nb EVs exhibited minimal immunogenicity risks compared to lipid‐based and lentiviral carriers, despite their comparable anti‐tumor activity. Taken together, the CD3‐targeting EVs could drive the in vivo generation of bispecific CAR‐T cells to effectively eliminate cancers and improve memory response with minimal immunogenicity.",

As an influenza vaccine adjuvant, 101‐mer induced significantly enhanced anti‐influenza antibody response and immune protection compared with other arabinomannan motifs. 101‐mer elicited robust immunoenhancement while exhibiting a favorable tolerability profile, as it did not trigger any observable physiological toxicity or inflammatory reactions in various organs.

Considerable efforts have been exerted in developing versatile synthetic methods to manipulate the architectures and properties of GNRs. However, these synthetic methodologies have still struggled to achieve a delicate control over the sequence and function of GNRs at the molecular level, thereby limiting their application potentials across a range of scientific and technological fields. Herein, we report a robust liquid‐phase bottom‐up synthesis strategy for the creation of sequence‐regulated functional GNRs, enabling precise control over the side‐chain sequence of GNRs. Using this approach, diversified sequence‐regulated GNRs have been produced, demonstrating readily regulated hierarchical nanostructures and optical properties, attributing to their sequence‐dependent molecular stacking mode. This liquid‐phase bottom‐up synthetic technology enabled the incorporation of the side‐chain structural and functional diversity into GNRs, further holding great promise for optoelectronic and biomedical applications.",

Here, we introduce a statistics‐based group‐testing strategy, which we couple with luminescence quenching assays to efficiently identify cooperative molecular interactions. Utilizing the quenching of a photosensitizer as a quick readout for chemical activity, 4,950 substrate pairs were screened in only 504 experiments, enabled through a combinatorial design theory‐based pooling approach and iterative deconvolution. Therefore, two algorithms—a greedy algorithm for group design and an iterative sectioning deconvolution method to resolve active pairs—were implemented. Fifteen cooperative pairs were identified, and the nature of their interactions and the resulting electronic perturbations were investigated. In a systematic follow‐up screen, it was found that the identified active pairs exhibit high reactivity towards a broad group of reaction partners. One such pair led to the discovery of a bench‐stable reagent, enabling efficient and regioselective trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. This work establishes a broadly applicable framework for accelerating the discovery of cooperative reactivity through optimized experimental designs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract For over a century, the terms “carotid bulb” and “carotid sinus” have been used inconsistently across anatomy, imaging, and clinical practice, resulting in terminological ambiguity with implications for diagnostic reporting and procedural communication. This review establishes that these are distinct, non‐equivalent entities, and that their conflation undermines diagnostic precision and procedural safety. The carotid bulb (CB) is a variable geometric dilation of the carotid bifurcation, defined by luminal expansion and hemodynamic significance. Its fusiform widening creates regions of low, oscillatory wall shear stress that predispose to atherosclerotic plaque formation along the posterolateral internal carotid artery. In contrast, the carotid sinus (CS) is a neurohistological construct, a specialized baroreceptor field concentrated predominantly on the medial wall of the proximal internal carotid artery. These mechanosensitive nerve terminals transduce circumferential wall strain into arterial pressure signals, forming the afferent limb of the baroreflex arc. Critically, the CB and CS exhibit spatial dissociation: baroreceptors are concentrated medially, where hemodynamic forces are benign, whereas atherosclerotic disease develops posterolaterally, where flow disturbance is maximal. Immunohistochemical mapping confirms that baroreceptor density does not correlate with CB geometry. This mismatch explains variable hemodynamic responses during carotid interventions and the failure of imaging‐based anatomical landmarks to predict baroreflex function. The clinical consequences are tangible: conflated terminology obscures dual pathology in risk stratification, complicates surgical planning during carotid endarterectomy and stenting, and undermines precision in baroreflex activation therapy. We advocate for systematic adoption of function‐based terminology: “carotid bulb” for geometric features, and “carotid sinus” strictly for the neural receptor zone.",

    "Abstract": "The relationship between cannabinoids and mental health has become a major focus of scientific inquiry and public discourse. Cannabinoids are diverse chemical compounds from the Cannabis species that have been explored for their therapeutic applications in treating chronic pain, psychiatric and neurological conditions, such as depression, schizophrenia, epilepsy and anxiety. Additionally, cannabinoids are frequently used for recreational purposes. The evolving legislation surrounding cannabis has added a layer of complexity to the understanding of its pharmacological effects. Societal attitudes shifting towards a more permissive acceptance of cannabis use make it essential to balance individual freedom with public health concerns. While the use of cannabinoids remains a subject of ongoing research, clinical data have shown promise in the treatment of mental health disorders. However, debates and concerns have been raised regarding the potential pharmacokinetic (PK) drug–drug interactions that may occur, involving changes in the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of the prescribed drugs. The future prospect of patients having unrestricted access to cannabis requires special attention in case of concurrent use with the common medical treatments they may be receiving for a cardiovascular or metabolic disease or with medications related to the treatment of psychiatric disorders. This comprehensive review aims to critically discuss the main PK interactions of major cannabinoids (tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, cannabinol, cannabichromene and cannabigerol) in relation to the drugs prescribed in neuropathic pain, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, epilepsy and cancer, as well as with the most common cardiometabolic disease treatments such as statins, beta‐blockers, warfarin, insulin analogues and metformin.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Technological advances, including remote sensing, have led to a proliferation of metrics used in ecological studies to examine spatial patterns of fire regimes and their ecological effects. Researchers can use many different metrics to analyse spatial variation in both fire events and resulting fire regimes, including fire size, shape, intensity, frequency and seasonality. However, variation in metric selection, definition, and application can yield inconsistent findings and/or difficulty in the synthesis of findings from different studies. This review aims to ( i ) visualise trends in spatial terminology within the broader fire ecology literature, ( ii ) characterise the variability among metrics for describing spatial fire patterns, and ( iii ) evaluate the ecological relevance of metrics, identifying opportunities to enhance consistency. This review comprises three sections. First, we used topic modelling to determine topic trends in fire ecology over the last three decades (1991–2025). We found a shift from studies primarily focused on individual fire regime aspects to a more holistic approach incorporating multiple fire regime aspects, including spatial patterns. Second, we present findings from a qualitative review, revealing marked variation in metric selection within and among taxa, biomes, and the technique used to measure spatial metrics. We also identified ecological processes, such as dispersal capacity, that prompt researchers to use more specific metrics to analyse their study system more precisely, leading to less consistency among studies. Finally, we offer recommendations for enhancing metric consistency whilst maintaining the flexibility to adapt and develop those metrics most relevant and informative for a given objective. As technological advances allow for a more complete description of the spatial attributes of a fire regime, there is a potential trade‐off between generality and precision, reducing comparability among studies. To ensure ecological relevance, it is crucial to consider the characteristics of data, landscape, and ecological contexts when selecting and applying metrics. Recent advances in landscape analysis techniques, such as through applying information theory, are leading to metrics that can be broadly applicable across study systems. Using the most generalised metrics possible, reporting standardised metrics of all fire regime components, aligning with landscape ecology where appropriate, and staying updated on emerging techniques will ensure the fire ecology field can move forward with a more coordinated approach.",

This paper addresses this need by presenting a comprehensive project‐based learning module that fuses LabVIEW‐based virtual instrumentation with machine learning (ML) for teaching industrial condition monitoring. Implemented in a senior‐level undergraduate course, the module tasks student teams with diagnosing the health of an industrial fan. Using the NI ELVIS educational platform instrumented with an accelerometer, students acquire real‐time vibration data. A key innovation is the seamless integration of LabVIEW, used for data acquisition and visualization, with a Python‐based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which classifies the fan's condition (normal, minor, or severe malfunction) and rotational speed. The technical implementation achieved high classification accuracy (exceeding 95% on test data) and low inference latency (approximately 0.1 s), demonstrating the feasibility of real‐time ML deployment. Pedagogically, the project provided an authentic, interdisciplinary learning experience, enhancing student understanding of vibration analysis, sensor integration, and the practical application of deep learning. The module successfully demonstrates a scalable framework for incorporating AI into engineering laboratories, effectively preparing students for roles that require synthesizing physical system knowledge with intelligent algorithm deployment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Temperature and humidity regulation is crucial across industrial and real‐life applications, where precise environmental control impacts efficiency, product quality, and system reliability. However, the coupled nature of temperature and humidity dynamics, combined with system inertia and time delays, presents significant challenges for conventional control strategies. While traditional approaches such as proportional–integral–derivative (PID) and fuzzy PID have been widely explored, they often rely on accurate system models and involve complex tuning procedures. To address these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) scheme for robust decoupling temperature–humidity regulation in a fermentation chamber. The approach applies first‐order ADRC to the temperature channel and second‐order ADRC to the humidity channel, considering their distinct dynamic behaviours and delay characteristics. The cross‐coupling effects are modelled as lumped disturbances and compensated in real time through an extended state observer (ESO), enabling model‐independent decoupling and enhanced disturbance rejection. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves comparable response speed to the conventional PID‐based decoupling method, while significantly improving robustness, disturbance rejection, and steady‐state accuracy under parameter variations. The method maintains a simple structure suitable for practical industrial implementation.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Color matching is a key element in product design that forms visual harmony, emotional connection, and spatial perception. As perfect balance between aesthetic value and perceptual continuity is still difficult to attain in view of differences in individual perception of color, this research seeks to provide a systematic and quantifiable approach to understanding how combinations of colors affect emotional expression and visual beauty in mechanical product design. The research uses the Aesthetic Measurement Model (AMM) with Markov decision‐making theory to analyze 125 color palettes that fully cover the applied color coordinate system. The aesthetic measure theory is used to identify the unity and coherence of color aesthetics, and Markov decision theory is used to identify the connection among mechanical product images and color combinations, which results in five symbolic color variations from two representative samples. Statistical verification enhances the reliability and stability of results, validating the method connecting quantitative and qualitative color ratings. The AMM‐Markov decision‐making theory achieved a predictive accuracy of 96.5%, surpassing existing analyses and demonstrating improved capability in assessing product aesthetic quality. The research advances color‐based design methods by integrating aesthetic measurement with decision‐theoretic modeling, enhancing emotional appeal, visual beauty, and overall design quality of mechanical products.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The effect of the overload principle in motor skill acquisition is unclear. Hence, the present study examined the effect of the overload principle in general, and in particular how the overload principle can be used to increase transferability to nontrained balance tasks with a high level of similarity at different levels of difficulty. A total of 24 participants were randomly assigned to two training groups: (1) low‐difficulty training group and (2) high‐difficulty training group. Both training groups completed five training sessions consisting of 25 trials over three weeks and only the level of difficulty of the balance board differed. Both the low and high‐difficulty training groups had a significant improvement in balance performance in the specific trained conditions, which supports the specificity principle. Most interestingly, only the high‐difficulty training group showed significant positive transfer to balance tasks with lower levels of difficulty. The low difficulty training group did not show significant positive transfer to balance tasks with higher levels of difficulty. These findings support the effect of the overload principle. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate the superior effect of task‐specific balance training, and, most interestingly, the study revealed that training with overload at higher levels of difficulty enhances transferability to similar tasks performed at lower difficulty levels.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Agarwood is a precious aromatic material and is often used in the perfumery industry for its unique scent. Due to the high price and less resources of Chinese agarwood, Southeast Asian varieties are widely circulated. To better understand the differences, 15 batches of agarwood were collected from China and Southeast Asia. The volatile components of agarwood from different habitats were identified by GC–MS and analysed by various chemometrics methods. Nine components were identified as potential markers for geographical discrimination, with significant differences in their relative abundances. These markers include lupeol, costol, (2aS,3aR,5aS,9bR)‐2a,5a,9‐Trimethyl‐2a,4,5,5a,6,7,8,9b‐octahydro‐2H‐naphtho[1,2‐b]oxireno[2,3‐c]furan, 6‐benzyloxy‐3,4‐dihydro‐4,4‐dimethyl‐coumarin, guaiol, 6,7‐dimethoxy‐2‐phenethyl‐4H‐chromen‐4‐one, 6‐methoxy‐2‐phenethyl‐4H‐chromen‐4‐one, longifolenaldehyde, β ‐cyclocostunolide. Bioactivity assessments revealed that the Chinese agarwood extracts exhibited more potent α‐glucosidase inhibitory and antioxidant activities. This enhanced efficacy correlated with a higher relative content of the identified bioactive compounds. Our study delineates the chemical and bioactivity profiles of agarwood, providing a theoretical basis for origin authentication and supporting the further development of Chinese agarwood for potential hypoglycemic and antioxidant applications.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT While the existing research uncovers interconnections between various housing markets, it largely ignores the question of whether such linkages can improve house price predictions. To address this issue, we proceed in two steps. First, we forecast disaggregated house price growth rates from Australia and China to determine whether incorporating price links can improve out‐of‐sample predictions. We find that accounting for within‐city house price interconnectivity in Sydney and Melbourne can indeed improve house price predictions. However, when forecasting city‐level prices from China, univariate models produce superior predictions. Second, in order to shed light on our empirical findings, we conduct simulation experiments calibrated to reflect the connections estimated from the data. The predictive ability of house price connectivity hinges on the sparsity and strength of the connections between interconnected markets. In the presence of stronger and denser connections, connectivity information is crucial for improving short‐term forecasts. On the other hand, when the connections are sparse and weak (as in the Chinese housing data), the univariate models outperform. Our study shows that finding evidence of significant price interconnections does not always lead to forecasting gains.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Rock magnetic properties, magnetic anisotropy and magnetic fabrics of crustal rocks are controlled by lithology and crustal processes like metamorphism, which causes a systematic variation in the rock magnetic properties and magnetic fabrics. Such variations of rock magnetic properties and magnetic fabrics due to lithology and grade of metamorphism are still to be unravelled in detail. In this study, rock magnetic and anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility (AMS) studies are conducted on the metamorphic rocks belonging to granulite facies (quartzofeldspathic rocks/migmatite and granite gneiss), amphibolite facies (meta‐gabbro and meta‐norite) and associated igneous intrusions of the Proterozoic Chhotanagpur Granite Gneissic Complex (CGGC) of the East Indian Shield. The main aim is to determine the control of the metamorphic grade on the rock magnetic properties and the magnetic fabrics of the rocks. The main magnetic mineral identified is magnetite, with certain interferences of sulphide. Rock magnetic properties and magnetic fabrics show that the volcanic rocks exhibit the strongest magnetization due to their high concentration of stable single domain (SSD) magnetite. Magnetite dominates the magnetic mineralogy of both volcanic and metamorphic rocks; within the metamorphic sequence, SSD magnetite increases from amphibolite to granulite facies but decreases in migmatites owing to quartzofeldspathic enrichment. This integrated approach provides more robust magnetic proxies for metamorphic grade. Consequently, rock magnetic and magnetic fabric analyses together offer valuable insights into the metamorphic signatures of crustal basement rocks.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Sports bras function as a form of personal protective equipment, designed to minimize breast motion and pain. The sports bra design significantly affects breast support and discomfort. Although the use of underwire has been shown to enhance bra support, no quantitative data related to the relationship between underwire properties and bra performance has been published to guide designers and manufacturers in selecting underwire. This study aimed to quantitatively examine the relationship between underwire rigidity and breast motion and discomfort. Ten participants were recruited to perform treadmill running under six bra conditions: one without underwire and five with underwires of varying levels of rigidity. A decreasing trend was observed in vertical breast displacement, perceived breast movement, and discomfort as underwire rigidity increased. Significant exponential relationships were identified between underwire rigidity and vertical breast displacement. However, no significant associations were found for perceived breast movement and perceived breast discomfort. These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriately rigid underwires for sports bras, under the tested conditions (young women with bra size 75 C performing treadmill jogging/running at 7.5 and 10 km/h using the same bra model), offering valuable insights into the design and manufacturing of sports bras in the underwear industry.",

This paper proposes a novel hybrid approach that integrates Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to enhance secure communication and reduce energy consumption in IoMT‐based healthcare systems. The PKI framework provides secure device authentication and encrypted data transmission, while the biologically inspired SNNs enable low‐power, real‐time anomaly detection.

To validate the accuracy and reliability of Ln‐xTB, we conducted comprehensive benchmarks on different classes of lanthanide‐containing molecules (including halides, aqua complexes, and ligand‐coordinated complexes) and compared results with the reported all‐electron DFT calculations, effective core potential (ECP) methods, GFN0‐xTB, GFN1‐xTB, GFN2‐xTB, RM1, Sparkle/RM1, Sparkle/AM1, Sparkle/PM n ( n = 3, 6, 7), HF, MP2, CCSD(T) methods and experimental data. The results show that Ln‐xTB successfully optimizes lanthanide compound structures with an average mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.037 Å for bond lengths relative to all‐electron DFT, outperforming GFN2‐xTB (MAD = 0.134 Å) and approaching the accuracy of ECP methods (MAD = 0.024 Å). Relative errors in bond lengths of Ln‐xTB are predominantly within 3% (vs. all‐electron DFT) and 5% (vs. experimental data). The results of benchmarks indicate the newly developed Ln‐xTB method is more accurate than the previously reported GFN n ‐xTB ( n = 0, 1, 2) methods. The structure optimization of lanthanide complexes with hundreds of atoms by using the Ln‐xTB was completed in several seconds on a single CPU core. This work provides a set of accurate, efficient Ln‐xTB parameters, addressing the long‐standing trade‐off between precision and computational cost in lanthanide molecular chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background This study aimed to determine the potential interference of calcium dobesilate in two urinary total protein detection methods. Methods Urine samples from patients receiving calcium dobesilate were collected, and drug concentrations were quantified using liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry. Paired‐difference testing was used to assess if calcium dobesilate interfered with the total protein concentration measurement. The interference effect of calcium dobesilate on the detection method was evaluated using dose–effect experiments. Results In total, 22 24‐h urine samples and 50 spot urine samples were collected. The calcium dobesilate concentrations ranged from 76 to 738 mg/L (median: 243 [161, 328] mg/L) and 60–2236 mg/L (median: 370 [195, 667] mg/L) in the 24‐h and spot urine samples, respectively. Paired‐difference testing showed that the total protein results deviated by 0.8%–12.1% and 13.0%–286.4% with the pyrogallol red‐molybdate and benzethonium chloride methods, respectively, when the calcium dobesilate concentration was 4500 mg/L. The dose–response experiment with the benzethonium chloride method demonstrated a “J‐shaped” effect; negative interference on the total protein concentration occurred at low and medium calcium dobesilate concentrations, but positive interference occurred at high calcium dobesilate concentrations. Conclusions Calcium dobesilate did not significantly interfere with the pyrogallol red‐molybdate method but did significantly interfere with the benzethonium chloride method. The direction and degree of interference were related to the urinary protein and drug concentrations. Discontinuing calcium dobesilate for 1–2 days before obtaining a urine sample for total protein detection is recommended.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose To evaluate 6‐month knowledge retention and long‐term satisfaction after two pedagogical escape games (PEGs) addressing foundational (3D printing) and clinical (pediatric dentistry) content in a dental curriculum. Methods In this monocentric serial cross‐sectional study, immediate post‑PEG knowledge was assessed in fifth‑year dental students using two 16‑item true/false tests on 3D printing and pediatric dentistry ( n = 176 and n = 190, respectively). Delayed knowledge was assessed 6 months later using the same tests in independent cohorts of sixth‑year students who had previously completed the same PEGs ( n = 106 and n = 116). A five‑item Likert‑scale questionnaire completed by sixth‑year students ( n = 127) captured long‑term satisfaction and perceived educational value. Between‐cohort comparisons used Wilcoxon rank‐sum tests. Results Knowledge scores declined for 3D printing (13.83 ± 2.19 vs. 12.13 ± 1.89/16, p &lt; 0.05) and remained stable for pediatric dentistry (13.23 ± 1.61 vs. 12.92 ± 1.54/16, p &gt; 0.05). Losses in 3D‑printing knowledge were concentrated on conceptual and procedural items. Delayed satisfaction remained high, with strong lasting impressions of the PEGs, perceived learning benefits, improved perception of the disciplines, and a clear desire for more PEGs in the curriculum. Conclusion Six‑month knowledge retention differed by domain, likely reflecting routine clinical reinforcement for pediatric dentistry and lack of downstream rehearsal for 3D printing. Embedding brief spaced refreshers for foundational topics and relying on clinical exposure for consolidation of clinical content may help sustain learning over time. Findings support integration of PEGs with follow‐up.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This study examines the influence of corporate governance mechanisms on financial performance and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) investments in Portuguese‐listed small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs). This research explores how governance structures, such as board size, CEO duality, and board independence, affect both financial outcomes and CSR decisions through the lens of Agency Theory and Stakeholder Theory. Utilizing panel data regression analysis over a 10‐year period (2014–2024), the study highlights the positive impact of board size and independence on both financial performance and CSR investment. In contrast, CEO duality is found to negatively influence these outcomes, reflecting its detrimental effect on governance effectiveness. Furthermore, the moderating role of stakeholder pressure is explored, revealing that external pressures from consumers, investors, and regulators enhance the effectiveness of governance mechanisms in promoting sustainability alongside profitability. The findings contribute to the literature by addressing the gap in governance research for SMEs in emerging economies, particularly in Portugal. The study provides actionable insights for corporate leaders and policymakers aiming to enhance governance frameworks that balance financial success with responsible business practices.

The plant parts, such as the leaves, bark, and stems of both palms, were macerated in polar and nonpolar solvents (petroleum ether, chloroform, and methanol) to determine their antibacterial and antibiofilm potential. The % yield was comparatively more (6.42%) in the methanol crude extract of the stem of S. romanzoffiana , followed by the petroleum ether extract of the leaves of B. nobilis (6.24%). Overall, S. romanzoffiana has shown better results against these DR bacteria, with the highest antibacterial activity, as evidenced by a 26.3±0.33 mm zone of inhibition observed with the methanol stem extract against E. coli . On the contrary, S. romanzoffiana showed better biofilm inhibition activity, with a substantial value of 63.9±1.11% for the chloroform bark extract against the E. coli strain.

    "Abstract": "Abstract The marine environment constitutes a significant source of Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) to the atmosphere with impacts on ecosystem functioning, atmospheric particle formation, carbon cycling and climate. However, processes governing BVOC emissions remain largely unconstrained due to their large spatial and temporal variability. Here, we describe a closed‐loop measurement system that couples a Proton Transfer Reaction Time‐of‐Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR‐ToF‐MS) to gas‐tight chambers which allows for the real‐time semi‐continuous detection of BVOCs emitted by marine organisms under different experimental treatments. We tested our system for adsorptive losses, reproducibility, linearity and accuracy with four BVOCs (dimethyl sulfide (DMS), methanethiol (MeSH), isoprene and α ‐pinene) at concentrations relevant in the marine environment. While all compounds demonstrated linearity ( R 2 ≥ 0.970) between the dissolved and gas phase, the regressions were statistically significant for DMS and MeSH. A direct relationship between compound recovery and compound solubility was observed, with the low solubility compounds isoprene and α ‐pinene demonstrating poor recovery and the higher solubility compounds DMS and MeSH exhibiting greater recovery. The closed‐loop system demonstrated minor compound loss (&lt; 7%) throughout and high reproducibility (&gt; 88.5%). A sampling time of 605 s was determined to be sufficient for signal stabilization of the four target BVOCs during headspace sampling/measurements. The development of this system provides a novel approach for assessing key drivers of BVOC emissions with broad applicability to both marine and freshwater systems.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Breast cancer represents the leading cause of mortality among women worldwide. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype does not express estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Her2, as well as presents a high expression of Ki67. In addition, TNBC presents the highest incidence of metastasis. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a hematopoietic cytokine that is produced in the kidney; however, EPO is also produced in non‐hematopoietic cells. Treatment of breast cancer patients with EPO is associated with poor prognosis and decrease of survival. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible process in which epithelial cells decrease or lose their epithelial characteristics and acquire properties of mesenchymal cells. EMT is implicated in normal processes and tumor progression. We previously demonstrated that EPO induces an EMT process in MCF10A mammary non‐tumorigenic epithelial cells. In this study, we demonstrate that PI3K activity mediates the EMT process induced by EPO in MCF10A cells. Moreover, Balb/cJ mice inoculated with TNBC 4T1 cells and treated with EPO develop mammary tumors with more weight and volume and an increase in the total number of metastatic nodules in lungs and liver through PI3K activity compared with untreated Balb/cJ mice inoculated with 4T1 cells. In conclusion, PI3K activity mediates the EMT process in MCF10A cells and the growth of mammary tumors and metastasis to lungs and liver induced by EPO in Balb/cJ mice inoculated with TNBC 4T1 cells.",

The model can be used to describe the motion of a mixture of two viscous compressible fluids. We first construct a viscous contact wave which approximates to the contact discontinuity, which is a basic wave pattern of compressible Euler equation. Then we prove that the viscous contact wave is time‐asymptotically stable, provided that the strength of contact wave and the initial perturbation are sufficiently small. The proof is given by the elementary ‐energy method.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT We investigate the transition between stability and chaos in the damped Klein‐Gordon equation, a fundamental model for wave propagation and energy dissipation. Using semigroup methods and spectral criteria, we derive explicit thresholds that determine when the system exhibits asymptotic stability and when it displays strong chaotic dynamics, including Devaney and distributional chaos as well as topological mixing. The results yield a classification of the dynamical regimes in terms of damping, stiffness, and propagation parameters, showing that the system admits only two long‐term behaviours: Convergence to equilibrium or chaos. This dichotomy not only unifies and extends previous partial results but also highlights the mechanisms by which linear partial differential equations can generate complex dynamics typically associated with nonlinear systems. Potential applications arise in acoustics, wave mechanics, and signal transmission, where predicting the onset of chaos versus stability is of practical importance.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective This study is designed to explore the effectiveness of pleasure perception training group (PPTG) therapy on adolescents with depression and the factors that influence the presence of non‐suicidal self‐injurious behavior (NSSI). Methods A hundred and twenty adolescent depression patients were randomly assigned to either a control group ( n = 60, routine treatment) or an observation group ( n = 60, PPTG plus routine treatment) for two months. Outcome included depression (CDI), emotional intelligence (EIS), and self‐injury (OSI) scores. Patients were stratified into NSSI and Non‐NSSI groups based on NSSI history. Univariate and multifactorial logistic regression analyses were conducted to explore potential risk factors for NSSI. Results Post‐treatment, CDI scores decreased and EIS scores significantly increased in both groups, with greater changes in the observation group ( p &lt; 0.05). OSI scores decreased in patients with NSSI, with lower scores in the observation group ( p &lt; 0.05). Regression analysis identified family history of psychiatric disorders, left‐behind experience, childhood family dysfunction, childhood abuse, and exposure to school bullying as independent risk factors for NSSI (OR &gt; 1, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion PPTG therapy effectively reduces depressive symptoms, enhances emotional regulation, and lowers NSSI in adolescents with depression.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The transition from static to dynamic vision is encoded in the superior colliculus (SC), as recently shown using blood oxygen level–dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD‐fMRI) of the rat brain. Visual stimulation at a higher frequency than the flicker fusion frequency threshold is associated with a negative BOLD response in the visual cortex, triggered by the SC. Here, we explored this mechanism in further depth using visual stimulation at low (1 Hz) and high (25 Hz) frequencies in the rat. We used both BOLD‐fMRI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)–fMRI to yield complementary information on brain activity during visual stimulation, from neurovascular and neuromorphological coupling perspectives. We compared responses between different brain regions (the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus, the medial and lateral parts of the SC, the corpus callosum, and the visual cortex), sexes, and field strengths (9.4 and 14 T). Results confirmed distinct BOLD responses to low‐ and high‐frequency stimulation and highlighted for the first time that the transition from static to dynamic vision is characterized by negative BOLD in the lateral SC specifically. Whereas the BOLD response to visual stimulation depends on the vasculature properties across brain regions and sexes, we found a significant ADC‐fMRI response (in the form of reduced ADC during excitatory activity) in the SC that was more consistent across visual frequencies, as well as in the corpus callosum, to which BOLD was not sensitive. Our results support an interplay between neural activity and hemodynamic response underlying the transition from static to dynamic vision, best characterized using two fMRI contrasts.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) affects the patient's quality of life. Currently, hypoglycemic drugs are mainly used for the standard care for T2DM, but they appear to cause many adverse reactions. As a traditional therapy, acupuncture has been gradually applied to the treatment of T2DM. However, the best acupuncture regimen is still uncertain. Therefore, we evaluated the clinical efficacy of various acupuncture therapies in the treatment of T2DM. Up to December 2nd, 2024, eight databases were searched. The data were analyzed using Stata 15.1 and R 4.2.1 software. The included studies were assessed for bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (RoB2.0). A total of 139 randomized controlled trials were included, involving 12,231 patients with T2DM. The results showed that compared with conventional treatment (CT), body acupuncture + CT had the best effect on improving fasting blood glucose (FBG) (MD = –0.84, 95% CI: –1.01, –0.67; SUCRA = 84.44%) and HbA1c (MD = –1.08, 95% CI: –1.42, –0.76; SUCRA = 87.44%); auricular acupuncture + CT had the best effect on improving 2 h postprandial blood glucose (2hBG) (MD = –1.56, 95% CI: –2.05, –1.06: SUCRA = 82.10%), and laser acupuncture + CT had the best effect on improving homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR) (MD = –2.46, 95% CI: –5.85, 0.96; SUCRA = 83.95%), fasting insulin (FINS) (MD = –7.21, 95% CI: –19, 4.54; SUCRA = 82.00%) and overall response rate (RR = 1.45, 95% CI: 0.97, 2.31; SUCRA = 84.00%) Acupuncture can effectively improve diabetes related indicators. Body acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, and laser acupuncture appear to be the most advantageous options for managing T2DM. However, due to the low quality of the included studies, more evidence may be needed to verify the conclusions.",

The objective of this study was to characterize and validate a new transcriptional profile of APC. Methods Single‐cell (sc)/nuclei (sn) RNA‐Seq was performed on nuclei from whole WAT ( n = 20), cells from WAT stromal vascular fraction ( n = 5), and cultured APC in vitro ( n = 8) using ICELL8 smart‐Seq technology. Additional snRNA‐Seq was performed on WAT using 10x genomic platform. Pseudotime analyses and differentiation of hiPSCs was used to track the temporal patterns of novel gene signatures. Immunohistochemistry was performed to validate a new marker. Results A pre‐adipocyte population was found across the four independent datasets that expressed known pre‐adipocyte markers ( ZNF423 and DLK1 ) in addition to genes typically associated with neurogenes ( DPP10, PTRPT, CTNNA2, NRXN3, CTNNA2, PTPRD, CNTNAP2 and RBFOX1 ). The expression of these genes were temporally regulated with adipocyte differentiation. Immunohistochemistry analyses confirmed these pre‐adipocytes are located in the neurovascular niche of WAT but are not neurons or endothelial cells. Conclusions This work has defined a new transcriptional signature of pre‐adipocytes in human subcutaneuous WAT that are distinct from mesencyhmal stem cell populations and represent novel targets for WAT expansion.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper proposes a disturbance‐observer‐based tube model predictive control (DTMPC) strategy to address the regulation problem of continuous‐time linear systems with additive bounded disturbances. The strategy integrates two elements: disturbance compensation and optimal control inputs. The former is designed using the estimation information from the disturbance observer to actively compensate for disturbances. The latter employs the estimation error bound to calculate the disturbance invariant set, which is then incorporated into the DTMPC design to determine the optimal control input. By compensating for the disturbances, the system's uncertainty and steady‐state error are minimized. As the estimation error bound decreases and stabilizes, the disturbance invariant set reduces, thereby expanding the feasible set of the nominal state. Finally, recursive feasibility and robust stability of the system are analyzed. The performance of the proposed DTMPC is verified by applying it to a self‐balancing vehicle system and comparing it with the TMPC.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The problem of a variable‐speed unicycle guidance to the stationary target is considered. The vehicle should be guided to the origin while minimizing the energy loss due to the induced drag. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem with a known velocity profile and, consequently, a known drag coefficient profile. Since no analytical solution is available, a numerical parameter continuation procedure is employed. The parameter continuation algorithm comprises the parameterization of both the system dynamics and the cost by a single parameter. The system dynamics equation is parameterized in such a way that if the parameter is equal to zero, the dynamics equation is that of a quadratic‐kinematic approximation of the original system, whereas if the parameter is equal to one, it is the original nonlinear one. In the cost parametrization, the values of zero and one correspond to the cost with constant and variable speed, respectively. A numerical algorithm based on Davidenko's equation is derived. By an extensive simulation, it is shown that the proposed method converges from a wider set of initial and terminal conditions than the classical parameter continuation method and a state‐of‐the‐art alternative solver. This improvement is due to both the dynamics/cost parameterization and choosing an initial guess from the quadratic‐kinematic approximation.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Natural Fiber‐Reinforced Composites (NFRCs) have emerged as potential alternatives to synthetic fiber‐based composites for engineering applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. Despite their advantages, such as biodegradability and availability, NFRCs face limitations that restrict their use to non‐structural applications due to challenges such as low‐impact resistance. Hybrid composites have been employed to address these challenges. This study investigates the low‐velocity impact (LVI) response of abaca/rubber hybrid composites with varying stacking sequences: abaca/rubber/abaca [A/R/A], abaca/rubber/rubber/abaca [A/R/R/A], and abaca/rubber/abaca/rubber/abaca [A/R/A/R/A]. The composites were subjected to impact energy levels of 10.24, 17.14, and 23.95 J using a conical‐shaped impactor. Impact energy absorption, peak force, energy loss percentage (ELP), coefficient of restitution (CoR), and damage analysis were among the important performance metrics that were assessed. The [A/R/A] configuration demonstrated superior energy absorption, achieving 14.06% and 25.83% higher absorption compared to [A/R/R/A] and [A/R/A/R/A], respectively. The energy absorption ratios for [A/R/A], [A/R/R/A], and [A/R/A/R/A] were 70.06%, 60.20%, and 53.56%, respectively. Conversely, the [A/R/A/R/A] sequence exhibited enhanced damage resistance at all energy levels. These results indicate how hybrid composites may combine energy absorption and damage resistance to overcome the drawbacks of pure NFRCs, making them appropriate for sacrificial layer applications in low‐velocity impact conditions.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Hot spots are spatial regions of intense energy localization that govern initiation of secondary high explosives. Studies that characterize or compare simulated hot spots are frequently either qualitatively descriptive or resort to quantitative distribution functions that neglect stochastic variations and spatial correlations—effects that are also neglected in common comparison tests like the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. To this end, we develop an image distinguishability analysis (IDA) test based on principal component (PC) analysis that makes pixel‐by‐pixel comparisons between small, for example, O(10), image data sets. The IDA test makes comparisons through a generalized distance metric in the PC space and a test statistic that is derived to calculate ‐values. We derive a statistical distribution and criticality criterion to determine whether images are distinguishable from established baselines. We apply the IDA test on images generated from molecular dynamics simulations of hot spots from pore collapse in TATB to assess scale invariance in the complex patterns of hot spots that form in a representative high explosive crystal. The IDA test shows that TATB hot spot spatial temperature fields and their derived temperature histograms exhibit scale‐invariant features over specific intervals of shock orientation, strength, and initial pore diameter. However, the IDA test also shows that qualitatively different conclusions regarding invariance can be reached depending on whether the hot spot is treated as a spatially correlated field as opposed to a distribution function that lacks spatial information.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Function approximation methods have emerged as powerful mathematical tools in designing compliant motion controllers for collaborative robotic manipulation without requiring exact system models. However, many existing approaches rely on velocity feedback, which is often unavailable or impractical in real‐world scenarios. This paper presents a nonlinear, robust, and regressor‐free adaptive impedance control scheme for multiple electrically actuated manipulators. The proposed method leverages Balázs‐Szabados operators to estimate dynamic uncertainties with low computational overhead. A voltage‐level controller is formulated to incorporate actuator dynamics directly, enhancing the strategy's practical relevance. Furthermore, a simple observer is integrated to eliminate the need for velocity measurements. Lyapunov‐based analysis guarantees that both tracking and estimation errors are Uniformly Ultimately Bounded (UUB) in the presence of model uncertainties, friction forces, and external disturbances. Extensive simulations on a dual‐arm robotic platform manipulating a rigid object demonstrate the proposed controller's superior performance in terms of tracking precision, energy efficiency, and robustness. Specifically, the proposed method reduces ISE and IAE by up to 96.3% and 85.1%, respectively, compared to the fuzzy controller on a simple path, and achieves up to 89.1% ISE improvement on complex trajectories. Compared with other benchmark schemes—including the Fuzzy, Chebyshev Neural Network (CNN), and B‐spline‐based impedance controllers—the Balázs‐Szabados approach achieves up to 14.2% lower ISV than CNN and approximately 11.5% lower ISV than B‐spline across both manipulators, indicating smoother control efforts and reduced actuator workload.",

Using the Italian Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform (ICESP) as case study, it explores the mechanisms through which digital infrastructures orchestrate knowledge flows, facilitate structured learning, influence policy, and strengthen network governance. Findings reveal that ICESP's combination of technical tools and inclusive governance enables diverse actors—public institutions, businesses, academia, civil society—to co‐create and disseminate best practices, overcome systemic barriers, and align regulatory frameworks with practical needs. The study extends social capital theory by showing how digital platforms simultaneously build structural, relational, and cognitive capital to sustain circular innovation ecosystems. It also contributes to platform ecosystem research by illustrating how digital infrastructures act as socio‐technical systems that integrate bottom‐up collaboration with top‐down coordination. Managerially, the paper provides guidance for designing participatory, trust‐based platforms that enhance collaboration, learning, and policy coherence in circular transitions.",

The E7 countries (Turkey, Brazil, India, Mexico, Indonesia, Russia, and China) face rapid economic and demographic changes that influence public health, and this study examines the determinants of life expectancy in these nations from 2000 to 2023. The analysis is distinctive because it considers environmental and social factors together, including water availability, urbanization, healthcare expenditure, education, income inequality, sanitation, population density, and greenhouse gas emissions. These indicators capture both natural pressures and social conditions that shape long‐term health outcomes. The study applies the Cross Sectional Augmented Autoregressive Distributed Lag model, which allows estimation of short and long‐run effects while accounting for heterogeneity and shared shocks, supported by robustness checks using AMG, CCEMG, and Fixed Effects with Driscoll–Kraay standard errors. The results show that unsafe water, pollution, and social inequality reduce life expectancy, while higher investment in healthcare, education, and sanitation improves it. By integrating environmental and social dimensions, the study provides a clearer understanding of public health challenges in fast‐growing E7 economies and highlights areas where coordinated policies can strengthen long‐term health outcomes.",

By systematically tuning the sputtering pressure and film thickness, we achieved precise control over the cathode morphology, resulting in tunable porosity and triple‐phase boundary (TPB) density. The GLAD‐fabricated LSCF cathode deposited at 0.40 Pa exhibited a nanocolumnar porosity of 21.5%, compared to 7.5% for a conventionally sputtered LSCF film. At a thickness of 240 nm, this cathode achieved a polarization resistance of 6.4 Ω cm 2 at 500 °C, in contrast to 32.9 Ω cm 2 for its conventionally sputtered counterpart. Electrochemical analysis attributed this improvement to enhanced gas diffusion and surface exchange properties enabled by the nanocolumnar architecture. An anodized aluminum oxide (AAO)‐supported thin‐film SOFC (TF‐SOFC) integrating the optimized GLAD‐fabricated LSCF cathode (with yttria‐stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolyte and nickel‐yttrium doped ceria (YDC) anode) delivered a peak power density of 836 mW cm − 2 at 550 °C.

Correlations of r 2 with hydrodynamic size, ζ‐potential, and coating thickness revealed that ligand chemistry–specifically hydrophilicity and anionic surface charge–dominates over physical shell dimensions in governing water accessibility and magnetic dephasing. This scalable ligand‐exchange strategy enables precise T 2 tuning at UHF, with phantom results reliably predicting in vivo UHF‐MRI performance in rat brain models, advancing the design of neuroimaging nanoprobes.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Wafer‐scale synthesis of metal telluride films has been hindered by the high volatility and limited reactivity of tellurium. To overcome this, we introduce a confined tellurization strategy utilizing in situ formed metal–tellurium (M–Te) alloys as controllable Te sources. Systematic investigation on appropriate metal species through cohesive energy calculations and experiments demonstrates that the cohesive energy of the source metal and metal‐to‐Te atomic ratio in the source bilayer are the key parameters dictating Te flux. Among many metals, Au–Te and Ag–Te alloys provide steady Te flux while preventing the delamination of M/Te bilayer (observed with Pt, Mo, Cu) after metal deposition on Te layer and the undesired co‐evaporation of metal (observed with In, Zn) during Te supply for M x Te y synthesis. With the Au–Te alloy, atomically‐smooth, single‐crystalline 4‐inch Si 2 Te 3 thin films are produced, which are the largest reported to date. The film thickness can be modulated by adjusting the Au/Te ratio, verified by structural and spectroscopic characterization. The generality of this concept is verified by synthesizing other tellurides, including MoTe 2 and Cr 2 Te 3 . The M–Te alloy source is recyclable by replenishing Te on the alloy, establishing this methodology as a robust and versatile platform for producing a wide range of high‐quality metal telluride films.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Nitrogen‐rich carbon nitride (g‐C 3 N 5 ) is an environmentally friendly and metal‐free organic semiconductor photocatalyst. In this study, a multistage‐enhanced photocatalyst was developed using g‐C 3 N 5 and Ti 3 C 2 MXene. Potassium salt and strong alkali regulation of g‐C 3 N 5 yielded a modified nitrogen‐rich carbon nitride (KCN). Subsequently, MKCN was formed via electrostatic self‐assembly with Ti 3 C 2 MXene, creating a “photogenerated electron capacitor” structure where KCN generates photogenerated electrons as the “positive electrode”, and Ti 3 C 2 MXene receives electrons as the “negative electrode”. Time‐resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), femtosecond transient absorption (fs‐TA), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) results indicate that the “capacitor” structure enables effective spatial charge separation and uniform surface potential, prolonging carrier lifetimes and enhancing catalytic participation. First‐principles calculations reveal that Ti 3 C 2 MXene offers stronger O 2 adsorption sites, increasing electron‐O 2 reaction probability and boosting two‐electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e–ORR) activity for H 2 O 2 production. In the composite system, rapid removal of photogenerated electrons from KCN increases hole concentration, inducing upward surface band bending and driving H 2 O oxidation to generate •OH. In situ spectra confirm this additional pathway for H 2 O 2 generation. Thus, MKCN exhibits excellent H 2 O 2 yield (32.61 mmol g −1 h −1 ), with good cycling stability. This work provide a new strategy and structure system for efficient photocatalytic H 2 O 2 synthesis.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Solar‐driven photocatalytic decarboxylation of amino acids is promising for the production of bio‐based amines to address intensive energy consumption and overmuch CO 2 emissions in conventional thermo‐catalytic process. In this work, we design a new heterogeneous photocatalyst with a rich oxygen vacancy (V O ) shell and Pt nanoclusters (Pt NCs) in TiO 2. The results unveil a strong interaction between the amorphous V O ‐shell layer and Pt NCs in the engineered Pt/TiO 2 @V O ‐shell catalyst, leading to a prolonged lifetime from 0.79 to 1.12 ns. In the photocatalytic decarboxylation of L‐lysine, Pt/TiO 2 @V O ‐shell exhibited a cadaverine selectivity of 70.2% and productivity of 154.5 mM/g, which is 14 and 111 times higher than that of TiO 2 @V O ‐shell. Notably, under sunlight irradiation of 1 h, the selectivity further increased to 73.5%. In addition, for other amino acids containing aliphatic side chains, the selectivity toward the corresponding amines exceeded 50%. Mechanistic study shows that positively charged V O s facilitate the adsorption and activation of L‐lysine via forming a bidentate bridging to produce alkyl radicals, while Pt NCs significantly promote the formation of hydrogen‐rich surface of TiO 2 to give a high selectivity of cadaverine. This work offers a novel design strategy of catalysts for bridging a sustainable solar energy utilization and high‐valued chemical synthesis.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved remarkable progress in the past decade, but their long‐term stability remains a major obstacle to commercialization. The stability of optoelectronic devices under real operating conditions is particularly critical, as ion migration induced by external factors such as light, heat, and humidity is a key cause of material and device degradation. Recently, the introduction of stimuli‐responsive materials into perovskite systems has endowed them with multifunctionality and operando stabilization, potentially transforming harmful external stimuli into beneficial factors for enhanced performance. Operando‐responsive systems can dynamically adjust their physicochemical state according to external stimuli such as illumination, temperature, or humidity, thereby providing adaptive protection during device operation. Therefore, developing such systems has become a cutting‐edge research direction for improving stability under harsh conditions. Such an approach not only provides a new pathway to overcome intrinsic instability issues but also expands the functional boundaries of perovskite materials, extending them beyond traditional photovoltaic applications. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in smart responsive strategies for PSCs, focusing on their underlying mechanisms and exploring how operando molecular dynamics redefine stability engineering. Furthermore, we outline the key challenges in developing truly operando adaptive smart self‐regulating PSCs and propose future directions for development.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Remote and high‐risk sectors such as mining, oil refineries, and power grids face growing security threats due to limited connectivity, sparse surveillance, and delayed incident response. Conventional monitoring approaches dependent on CCTV or internet connectivity are often ineffective in these environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an AI‐driven multi‐mote framework comprising the AI Vision Monitoring Mote, Routing Receiver Mote, and Gateway Receiver Mote. The AI Vision Mote, built on a Raspberry Pi with camera, motion, sound, and RFID sensors, performs real‐time detection of human intrusion, heavy vehicle movement, drones, and weapons using lightweight AI models such as TensorFlow Lite, OpenCV, and PyTorch. Routing and Gateway Motes extend coverage through LoRa‐based communication and provide sequential alerts via GSM and cloud integration. A prototype deployment was evaluated under simulated industrial conditions, demonstrating low latency, &lt; 1% packet loss, and reliable alert delivery. The framework enhances decision‐making and operational safety in disconnected regions, offering a scalable and cost‐effective solution for remote‐area security and surveillance. The proposed system demonstrated improved detection accuracy, reduced latency, and reliable communication in offline environments, making it suitable for deployment in remote‐area security applications.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Responding to recent calls to situate language learning strategy (LLS) research in contexts, this study examined contextual factors that influence LLS use in two distinct learning environments: a target language environment (TLE) and a foreign language environment (FLE). Nineteen doctoral students from universities in the United States and China participated. Data were collected through a background survey and semi‐structured interviews. Analysis identified eight contextual factors that influenced learners' strategy choices across the two environments: access to the target language environment, participation in academic settings, availability of target‐language learning resources, experiences as teaching or research assistants, exposure to diverse accents and dialects, experiences in target language classes, social reactions to speaking the target language, and limited feedback on errors. These findings contribute to LLS research by underscoring the central role of learning context in influencing strategy use. More importantly, they offer insights into fostering more effective strategy use and improving language learning outcomes. Pedagogical implications are also discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In New York City, more than 50,000 asylum seekers arrived between 2022 and 2023, and K‐12 public schools saw a dramatic increase in the enrollment of students in need of English language instruction. While multilingual newcomers—defined as students who have been in the U.S. for fewer than three years, come from all grade levels, and often are at earlier stages of English proficiency than other groups learning English—were already a common presence in New York City schools, this most recent group of students possessed a set of different learning needs because of the often traumatic circumstances leading to their migration to the U.S. In this Forum article, I share my experiences as a volunteer language teacher for recently arrived asylees in a New York City elementary school, including interviews with teachers who were working directly with students who had recently experienced trauma. I argue for a more thorough understanding of how forced migration can impact language acquisition as well as greater support for teachers at all levels to view language instruction through a trauma‐informed lens, thus ensuring that curriculum and pedagogy can best meet the unique needs of their students.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The Indian craft sector, one of the world's largest decentralized creative economies, embodies complex intersections of culture, livelihood, and commerce. Yet, existing scholarship and policy discourse remain fragmented, focusing narrowly on heritage preservation or isolated market interventions. This study develops a conceptual typology of business models within the Indian craft ecosystem by integrating distinction between instrumental and substantive value logics with framework of governance modes. Using a conceptual–analytical design grounded in secondary case analysis of representative enterprises, such as Fabindia, SEWA, Jaipur Rugs, KVIC, Raghurajpur, and GoCoop, the paper identifies six ideal‐type models: market‐oriented, cooperative and cluster‐based, value‐based hybrid models, state‐supported policy‐driven, experience‐driven and club‐good, and digital and post‐globalization models. The typology reveals how plural economic logics coexist through hybrid governance and evolving digital interfaces. The study contributes to cultural‐entrepreneurship and ecosystem literature by reconceptualizing crafts as a plural economy rather than a residual informal sector. It also provides actionable insights for policymakers and entrepreneurs seeking to align cultural sustainability with market viability. The framework offers a basis for comparative research across creative industries in emerging economies and invites empirical validation through longitudinal and mixed‐method approaches.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) face significant institutional barriers when expanding across borders, including regulatory constraints, financial accessibility issues, and market entry challenges. Institutional theory provides a useful framework for understanding how external regulative, normative, and cognitive institutional forces shape SME internationalization. This study conceptualizes SME internationalization performance as a higher‐order construct composed of three key dimensions: market entry, financial accessibility, and regulatory compliance. It examines how the adoption of digital platforms, fintech solutions, and blockchain technologies enables SMEs to overcome institutional barriers and enhance their internationalization performance. Using secondary data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), the OECD Digital Economy Index, and the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI), the study applies regression and factor analysis to assess the effects of digital adoption and institutional environments on SME internationalization performance. The findings indicate that technology‐enabled SMEs achieve faster market access, improved financial liquidity, and more effective regulatory compliance than traditional firms. The results also show that the strength of regulative, normative, and cognitive institutions significantly moderates the relationship between digital adoption and overall internationalization performance. This research contributes to institutional theory by demonstrating that institutional alignment—not digital capability alone—is essential for leveraging technology to scale SME operations internationally across heterogeneous economic contexts, and offers policy insights for improving digital infrastructure, regulatory coherence, and institutional trust to foster SME competitiveness in the global economy.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Timely care for open tibia fractures remains difficult in low‐resource settings. We evaluated a task‐sharing model in Malawi in which trained orthopedic clinical officers (OCOs) delivered external fixation supported by a remote quality assessment tool. Methods We conducted a prospective implementation evaluation across one central and four district hospitals (May 2023–July 2024). The intervention bundled OR refurbishment assured external fixator supply, refresher training, mentoring (on‐site and remote), national guideline reinforcement, and a novel Fracture Fixation Assessment Tool for External Fixation (FFATEF). OCOs submitted postoperative radiographs and construct photographs for scoring across four domains (reduction, stability, implantation, and surgical impression; total 0–12 and satisfactory ≥ 8). Nonparametric tests compared performance by the hospital type; temporal trends were assessed with Spearman correlation. Results Forty‐seven patients (89% male and mean age 32.3 years) were treated (central: n = 28 and district: n = 19). The central hospital managed more severe injuries (Gustilo IIIA/B 69.6% vs. 15.8%). Median FFATEF scores were higher at the central hospital (10.0 [IQR 9–11]) than district hospitals (6.0 [5, 6, 7, 8], p &lt; 0.001). Satisfactory scores (≥ 8) occurred in 93% of central versus 32% of district cases. Central scores improved over time ( ρ = 0.52; p = 0.005) whereas district scores were unchanged ( ρ = 0.15; p = 0.540). Preoperative antibiotic compliance was 100% at the central versus 47% at district hospitals. Conclusions When embedded within integrated surgical teams and adequate infrastructure, task sharing for open fracture external fixation yielded satisfactory technical performance but lagged district‐level implementation despite training. Comprehensive institutional support—mentoring intensity, equipment, supply chains, and referral adherence—is likely required for safe scale‐up. Validation of FFATEF against clinical outcomes and economic evaluation of delivery models are priorities.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Urban expansion and agricultural activities are primary drivers of degradation in Neotropical streams, affecting their physical integrity and, consequently, their fish assemblages. This study compared fish assemblages between 12 urban and rural streams in the Paranapanema River basin, using a set of 21 ecomorphological indices. Sampling was conducted in April 2019 in 50 m reaches, and ecomorphological data were analyzed using PERMANOVA, NMDS, SIMPER, RDA, functional diversity indices, and null models. PERMANOVA analysis revealed significant differences in the ecomorphological structure of the ichthyofauna ( p = 0.003), corroborated by a clear separation between groups in the NMDS ordination. SIMPER analysis indicated that the pectoral fin aspect ratio, caudal peduncle compression, lateral compression, mouth aspect, and relative caudal peduncle length were the main contributors to the dissimilarity between streams, explaining &gt; 50% of the variation. RDA showed that PPM (suspended solids) was the most significant environmental variable ( p = 0.04) structuring the assemblages. Fish assemblages in urban streams exhibited an ecomorphological pattern with higher values of caudal peduncle compression and relative caudal peduncle, traits adapted for short-distance swimming in turbid waters. In contrast, rural streams, with greater integrity, featured fish with higher lateral compression and pectoral fin aspect ratios, characteristics of structurally complex environments and adapted for higher speed and maneuverability. The results confirm that environmental changes caused by urbanization select for specific morphotypes and highlight the importance of conserving the physical integrity of streams for maintaining the ecomorphological biodiversity of fish communities.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Aims/hypothesis Children with early-stage (pre-symptomatic) type 1 diabetes are currently identified primarily via research-based screening programmes in Australia. Once identified, families live with the knowledge that their child has an increased chance of developing symptomatic, lifelong, insulin-requiring type 1 diabetes but have no specific clinical pathway available to them in Western Australia (WA) for accessing tailored support or education. This project aimed to co-design a new clinical pathway to address this unmet need. Methods Experience-based co-design (EBCD) methodology was applied, comprising three phases undertaken consecutively over 12 months. Recruitment for each phase was via open invitation with voluntary participation. Phases 1 and 2 involved facilitated community conversations and focus groups conducted separately for type 1 diabetes community members and healthcare professionals (HCPs). Data from these phases were analysed using deductive and inductive content analysis to identify key categories of information and a prototype clinical pathway was developed incorporating these. For phase 3, a combined workshop was held with all stakeholders to obtain feedback on the prototype, and refine it accordingly. Results In phase 1, 16 community members (people living with type 1 diabetes, families whose child or children had been screened for type 1 diabetes) and 36 HCPs (doctors, nurse educators, social workers, dietitians, a mental health nurse and administrative staff from Perth Children’s Hospital) participated in separate community conversations. The following three key categories were identified: (1) the need for education; (2) the need for support and strategies for managing uncertainty; and (3) the need for information on disease-modifying therapies and access to clinical trials. In phase 2, seven community members and 11 HCPs participated in separate focus groups. The following key priorities were identified: (1) the need for access to HCPs skilled in supporting patients to manage uncertainty; (2) the need for flexibility in delivery modes (telehealth/in-person); (3) the need for early referral to relevant clinical trials; and (4) the need for reliable and up-to-date resources. In phase 3, three community members and three HCPs attended a combined workshop to provide feedback on a prototype clinical pathway and their feedback was incorporated into a final version. Conclusions/interpretation Application of EBCD methodology enabled the development of a new clinical pathway tailored to the needs of WA families with a child living with early-stage type 1 diabetes.

Methods In 5065 multi-ethnic mother–infant pairs, we examined the conditional associations of maternal and fetal partitioned polygenic risk scores (pPRSs) for type 2 diabetes-related pathways with fetal growth outcomes, including birthweight, sum of skinfold thicknesses (SSF), large-for-gestational-age (LGA) births and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) births. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation (2SMR) in Europeans was performed for triangulation. Exposures were eight type 2 diabetes-related pathways ( n =1,812,017), eight beta cell function indices ( n =26,356) and two insulin sensitivity indices ( n =53,657). Outcomes were maternal and fetal genetically determined birthweight ( n =406,063). Mediation analysis was used to assess the mediation effects of maternal glucose levels and BMI on maternal genetic effects and of cord blood C-peptide on fetal genetic effects. Co-localisation analyses were performed to test for shared causal variants. Results Fetal type 2 diabetes polygenic risk score (PRS) and pPRSs for lipodystrophy-related insulin resistance and impaired fasting glucose (IFG)-related insulin deficiency were associated with lower birthweight and SSF, while maternal type 2 diabetes PRS and pPRSs for IFG-related insulin deficiency and obesity-related insulin resistance were associated with higher offspring birthweight, SSF and LGA. These associations were consistent across five ethnic groups. Maternal post-load hyperglycaemia mediated 44.2% and 34.2% of the effects of type 2 diabetes PRS and IFG pPRS, respectively, while maternal BMI mediated 43.4% of the effect of Obesity pPRS. 2SMR found consistent results in Europeans and further revealed that fetal insulin sensitivity index and corrected insulin response were associated with higher birthweight. Some loci with shared causal variants acted through multiple pathways, including CDKAL1 , TCF7L2 , ADCY5 and MACF1 . Conclusions/interpretation Reduced fetal growth may be driven by lipodystrophy-related insulin resistance and IFG-related insulin deficiency pathways. Targeting pregnant women with high type 2 diabetes PRS/pPRS and prescribing interventions to reduce their post-load hyperglycaemia and BMI may help reduce offspring risk of LGA. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Valeriano composite epithermal-porphyry Cu‒Au system in the El Indio-Maricunga metallogenic belt, Vicuña segment, consists of a shallow silicic lithocap with low-grade Au‒Ag ± Cu mineralization underlain by a large porphyry-Cu (± Mo, ± Au) deposit. A deep drillhole (VALD-D13-14) allows the systematic evaluation of bulk-rock Cu‒Mo isotope compositions over a vertical extent of ~ 1,900 m through the hydrothermal porphyry-epithermal system. Copper isotope values in the lower 1,000 m of the mineralized potassic and phyllic altered porphyry zone increase slightly upwards in the range of +0.2 to +0.4‰, and scatter in the upper phyllic and advanced argillic zone (δ 65 Cu: ‒3.7‰ to +2.7‰). The near-surface low-Cu leached zone has very negative δ 65 Cu values down to ‒6.5‰ and there are also some distinctly negative excursions in the deep potassic zone with subordinate advanced argillic alteration. Molybdenum isotope values are slightly negative in the potassic porphyry zone (δ 98 Mo: ‒0.3 to ‒0.2‰), but increase over the phyllic zone to positive values of 0.2‒0.3‰, and strongly scatter at the transition to the high-sulfidation epithermal system. The Cu and Mo isotope patterns can be mainly attributed to Rayleigh fractionation between vapor and brine in the magmatic-hydrothermal porphyry system and to redox-controlled isotope shifts during supergene alteration in the epithermal system. Deviations from the general trend in some deep drillcore intercepts relate to short intervals of advanced argillic alteration and corresponding redox fluctuations with Cu enrichment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Despite the proliferation of computer-generated texts, the concept of AI authorship remains ambiguous. This paper investigates evolving public perceptions of authorship pertaining to computer-generated texts through review of an international survey distributed in 2024/2025. Comparing results of this survey to those from the same survey distributed in 2017/2018, this paper offers what we believe to be the only longitudinal empirical consideration of AI authorship pre- and post-LLM boom. Even with dramatic technological advancements in natural language generation, this study suggests that societal understandings of authorship have only seen minor change since the survey’s first distribution. Participants continue to hold ambivalent opinions of AI authorship, perhaps partly due to the cultural and historical weight of the term ‘authorship’ itself. This ambivalence raises broader questions about the persistent usage of ‘authorship’ as a default term for describing computational text production. Through an interdisciplinary analysis represented by humanities and computational researchers, merging both quantitative and qualitative data, this paper interrogates whether the concept of authorship remains viable in discussions of computer-generated texts via feedback from survey participants.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Growing concerns over the downsides of an excessive number of tourist arrivals have led to increased focus on managing tourism flows and on the overtourism phenomenon. The aim of the paper is to interpret the concept of overtourism through the lens of urban economics. The paper extends an urban economic model to identify efficient intervals of urban touristic flows associated with situations in which average benefits exceed average costs for residents. Moreover, the analysis argues that cities can increase the number of tourists they can efficiently host or raise the threshold at which the city achieves overtourism by acting on their capacity to increase the quality of their tourist offer. The theoretical model is empirically confirmed through a municipal level cross sectional analysis on Italy, representing an interesting case due to large heterogeneity in terms of tourist flows and institutional proactivity toward tourism.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Hepatitis C virus remains a pressing global health issue that has driven extensive research for introducing advanced therapeutic regimens. Among these, the sofosbuvir (SFV)/ribavirin (RBV) drug regimen has had a profound effect on reducing the viral load. Nevertheless, this drug regimen has led to adverse testicular alterations. This study aimed to investigate the restorative effects of SFV/RBV over different durations to determine the possibility of restoring normal histological and histophotometrical testicular tissue. Swiss Albino mice were grouped as total n = 80 with subgroups of n = 5 per timepoint per group, into control group, SFV group received 41mg/kg once daily of SFV, RBV group administered with RBV 41 mg/kg twice daily, and SFV-RBV group received a combined dose of SFV + RBV, identical to those used separately. All drugs were administered by oral gavage for 5 successive days. Testicular tissue in the SFV, RBV, and SFV-RBV groups, at 5 and 70 days after administration, exhibited pronounced alterations, including spermatocyte degeneration, Leydig cell impairment, and disrupted spermatogenesis. Moreover, altered morphometric parameters were observed, characterized by a reduction in testicular area, a diminished seminiferous diameter, and a regression in spermatic epithelium thickness, which collectively contributed to a decline in the spermatogenic index and the conception index. Conversely, starting from day 140 and persisting through day 175 post-treatment, testicular architecture demonstrated substantial recovery, with restoration of spermatogenesis and improvements across morphometric parameters. The administration of SFV and/or RBV for 5 days induced significant testicular injury, which was reversed after 175 treatments. Restorative effects underscore the potential safety of SFV/RBV regimens in human males.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous prostate enlargement that significantly impacts the quality of life in aged men. Both oxidative stress and inflammation interplay to induce hyperplasia of prostatic epithelial cells as well as seminal vesicle tissues. Dihydromyricetin (DHM), extracted from Ampelopsis grossedentata , is used in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years. It exhibited prominent anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities in several models. To date, its potential protective effects for BPH have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of DHM in the management of testosterone-induced proliferation in prostate and seminal vesicle tissues. Male Wistar rats (200 to 250 g) were divided into three groups: a control group receiving sesame oil (the vehicle), a BPH group receiving testosterone oenanthate (3 mg/kg, subcutaneously) daily for 4 weeks to induce hyperplasia, and a DHM group receiving DHM (50 mg/kg) alongside testosterone oenanthate (3 mg/kg). DHM significantly reduced the prostate and seminal vesicle weights, ameliorated the histopathological changes induced by testosterone, and nearly normalized the serum testosterone, FSH, and LH levels. It also reduced the serum PSA level. Further, DHM reduced MDA levels while increasing GSH levels. Besides, it reduced the prostatic levels of 5-alpha reductase and attenuated TGF-β1/Smad-2 pathway. The anti-hyperproliferation and the anti-inflammatory effects of DHM were attributed to the attenuation of the expression of PCNA, procaspase-3, iNOS, TLR-4, and IL-1β in both the prostate and seminal vesicle tissues. DHM has potential protective effects against testosterone-induced BPH model via downregulation of inflammatory mediators, restoration of oxidative balance, and induction of cell apoptosis.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Cocaine use disorder (CUD) remains a major public health challenge with limited effective therapeutic options. Cannabidiol (CBD) has been proposed as a potential treatment due to its neuroprotective and anti-craving properties. This scoping review aims to synthesize and map the existing evidence from clinical trials evaluating CBD’s effects on craving reduction, relapse prevention, cognitive function, and emotional regulation in individuals with CUD. Although CBD was well tolerated and associated with fewer adverse events than conventional pharmacological treatments, clinical studies included in this review did not demonstrate significant efficacy over placebo in reducing cocaine craving, preventing relapse, or improving cognitive performance, despite promising preclinical outcomes. The review also highlights methodological limitations across studies, including variability in dosage, treatment duration, and study design. Although current evidence does not support CBD as a standalone treatment for CUD, its favorable safety profile suggests potential utility within a broader, multimodal therapeutic framework. Future research should prioritize standardized protocols and explore synergistic combinations with behavioral or pharmacological interventions to enhance treatment efficacy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose The standard modality for the diagnosis of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt failure is the radiographic shunt series (RSS). However, ultra-low dose computed tomography (ULD-CT) may replace RSS. The aim of this study was to compare the radiation doses of RSS and ULD-CT in the diagnosis of mechanical shunt failure in human phantoms including pediatric phantoms and to further reduce the total CT dose by reducing the topogram radiation. Methods Mechanical VP shunt complications were placed on human phantoms representing ages of 1, 5, 10 and 30 years. RSS and ULD-CT were performed on each phantom with different radiation doses of the topogram with varying tube currents (10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mAs). Effective doses of RSS and ULD-CT were estimated by using conversion factors. Results ULD-CT demonstrated lower effective doses than RSS in phantoms representing ages 5, 10 and 30 years, while successfully depicting all mechanical shunt complications. However, higher effective doses were assessed for ULD-CT scans of the 1-year phantom than RSS. The effective doses for RSS and ULD-CT (utilizing 10 mAs topograms), respectively, were estimated as follows: 1-year: 0.056 vs. 0.133 mSv; 5-year: 0.186 vs. 0.123 mSv; 10-year: 0.240 vs. 0.107 mSv; 30-year: 0.641 vs. 0.076 mSv. Conclusion This study demonstrated ULD-CT as an alternative to RSS for the detection of mechanical VP shunt complications, reducing radiation doses in phantoms equivalent to 5 years of age and older while demonstrating the complications equally to RSS. This may be of clinical interest, especially in children due to the reduction of radiation risks.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Subpectoral implant-based breast reconstruction is associated with complications such as animation deformity, chronic pain, and aesthetic dissatisfaction, significantly affecting patient quality of life (QOL). Prepectoral pocket conversion has emerged as an alternative to address these issues, particularly for patients with complications from prior subpectoral reconstruction. Despite its increasing use, limited data exist on the impact of this technique on patient-reported outcomes, including satisfaction and QOL. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of prepectoral pocket conversion, focusing on complications, aesthetic results, and patient-reported QOL improvements, using the BREAST-Q questionnaire. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study, conducted on 37 patients (60 breasts) who underwent prepectoral pocket conversion between January 2018 and March 2024. Demographic, clinical, surgical, and postoperative data were collected. BREAST-Q scores were compared pre- and post-conversion. Results Patients had a mean age of 53 years, with a median follow-up of 622 days (1 year and 8 months). Indications for conversion included capsular contracture (21.3%) and animation deformity (17.5%). Complications were minimal, with 1.7% hematoma and 6.7% capsular contracture. Significant improvements were observed in BREAST-Q scores for breast satisfaction ( P = 0.002), physical well-being ( P = 0.037), and sexual well-being ( P = 0.019). Fat grafting was required in 16.7% of cases to enhance aesthetic outcomes. Conclusions Prepectoral pocket conversion is a safe and effective procedure that alleviates complications of subpectoral reconstruction, improves aesthetic outcomes, and enhances patient satisfaction and QOL. Further prospective studies with larger cohorts are warranted. Level of Evidence: Level III, risk / prognostic study.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract A metal-insulator-metal (MIM) parallel plate thin-film capacitor of ceramic dielectric was fabricated using an n-type silicon wafer substrate and characterized electrically. The ferroelectric perovskite BST36 (Ba 0.36 , Sr 0.64 )TiO 3 thin film dielectric was deposited via the RF magnetron sputtering technique, and the film is employed as a dielectric for the parallel plate ceramic capacitor. A molybdenum disilicide (MoSi 2 ) thin film has been deposited via the DC magnetron sputtering technique, and the sheet resistance was 5.611 Ωcm − 2 , after thermal processing. It has been used as a bottom metal contact for the device. While indium (In), copper (Cu), and silver (Ag) were deposited via the thermal evaporation technique and employed as top contact electrodes for the device. Molybdenum disilicide (MoSi 2 ) has been used again as a top contact electrode as well as a bottom electrode. The capacitor was electrically characterized at room temperature under a 10 VDC bias and 1 MHz frequency. Measurements of dielectric loss, dielectric constant, and capacitance density were depended on the device structure and electrode material. The results of the MIM parallel plate capacitor structure of Ag/BST/MoSi 2 /n-Si exhibited the highest capacitance density achievement of 405 nFcm − 2 with a dielectric loss of 0.048. An optimal recorded dielectric loss was 0.024 at 10 VDC for the device structure In/BST/MoSi 2 /n-Si. The MoSi 2 /BST/MoSi 2 /n-Si a full parallel-plate ceramic capacitor device structure had a capacitance density of 47 nFcm − 2 , a dielectric constant of 22.3; and a dielectric loss of 0.035.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract High nitrogen (N) input is typical of irrigated intensively managed dairy pasture systems, but the plant uptake of the applied N is often low. This leads to high nitrate (NO 3 − ) accumulation in the soil which, under wet conditions, can trigger significant loss of N as nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and dinitrogen (N 2 ). We investigated the effect of soil moisture [60, 80 and 100% water filled pore space (WFPS)] and NO 3 − concentrations (45 mg and 80 mg NO 3 − -N kg − 1 soil) on emissions of N 2 O and N 2 by applying 15 NO 3 − -N as a tracer in laboratory conditions using soil from an intensive dairy pasture. The flux of N 2 dominated N loss at 80% and 100% WFPS and N 2 O emissions were more strongly affected by NO 3 − concentrations compared to N 2 emissions. N 2 O emissions responded more strongly to NO 3 − concentrations at 100% WFPS than at 80% WFPS. The flux of N 2 O was significantly lower at 60% WFPS compared to the other WFPS levels, with no detectable N 2 emission. Denitrification dominated N 2 O emissions at 100% WFPS, whereas at 80% WFPS, contributions from denitrification and other sources were similar. These results demonstrate that while managing soil moisture and NO 3 − availability can reduce N 2 O emissions in intensive dairy pastures, substantial fertiliser N losses as N 2 are likely to persist, limiting improvements in overall N use efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose This study aimed to compare the efficacy and long-term outcomes of tunica albuginea plication and Heinecke–Mikulicz corporoplasty techniques in children. Methods A retrospective review was performed on 176 children who underwent corrective surgery for CPC with a curvature angle between 30° and 60° between 2014 and 2022. Patients were classified into three groups: degloving alone (Group 1, n = 85), tunica albuginea plication (Group 2, n = 72), and Heinecke–Mikulicz corporoplasty (Group 3, n = 19). Results The mean age at surgery was 7.6 ± 3.2 years (range: 4–11). Curvature was mainly ventral or ventrolateral (84.8%). Mean preoperative curvature angles were 36.2°, 37.4°, and 41.4° in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Adequate correction was achieved with degloving alone in 48.2% of patients. In those requiring additional correction, complete straightening was obtained in all cases ( p &lt; 0.001). During a mean follow-up of 26.7 ± 17.7 months, curvature recurrence occurred in 18.8%, 19.4%, and 21.1% of patients in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Late complications included palpable suture knots in two patients from Group 2 and four from Group 3. Conclusions Tunica albuginea plication is a safe, effective, and practical option for correcting penile curvature in children when degloving alone is insufficient.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Dystonia due to loss-of-function variants in the GNAL gene in DYT-GNAL and 18p-deletion (18pdel) syndrome has been reported to respond well to pallidal deep brain stimulation (GPi-DBS) occasionally, but long-term data is scarce. GNAL is implicated in dopamine receptor function, which may explain anecdotal reports of hypokinesia in DYT-GNAL and 18pdel-associated dystonia, a phenomenon that has not yet been systematically reviewed. We retrospectively evaluated a cohort of three patients with GNAL variants treated with GPi-DBS, documenting individual long-term outcomes spanning up to 25 years. Dystonia severity was assessed using the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS) and the Burke − Fahn − Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS). We also documented bradykinetic symptoms and levodopa response. A literature review was added focusing on DBS outcomes and the effects of levodopa in DYT-GNAL and 18pdel-associated dystonia. In our patients, TWSTRS severity subscale I was reduced by 63% in early (≤ 12months; 20.7 to 7.7 points) and 81% in late follow-up (&gt; 12months; 20.7 to 4 points) after GPi-DBS χ. BFMDRS decreased by 67% and 44%; each with a Kendall’s coefficient of 0.78, indicating a high degree of concordance in improvement trajectories. Two patients exhibited bradykinesia, which was levodopa-responsive in one. GPi-DBS responses have been reported for another ten DYT-GNAL and two 18pdel-patients. Bradykinesia prompted levodopa challenges in 15 patients, resulting in improvement in five. Long-term follow-up data from three DYT-GNAL patients treated with DBS showed sustained improvement in dystonia, particularly in cervical symptoms. Bradykinesia may be an inherent clinical feature of GNAL-related dystonia, warranting further investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Mountain ecosystems are highly sensitive to climate variations. At fine spatial scales, high-elevation microclimates play a critical role in shaping biodiversity, hydrological processes, and ecosystem services, while also influencing the occurrence of natural hazards such as landslides, avalanches, and floods. Heat waves, which have been increasing in frequency and intensity due to global climate change, present significant challenges to these vulnerable environments. This study examines the impacts of summer heat waves on mountain microthermal conditions in three compartments: rockwalls, soils, and lakes. We assembled data across a latitudinal and elevational gradient in the French Alps including years of two recent heat wave events (2015 and 2022). We calculated thermal indicators to evaluate the buffering or amplifying effects of the atmospheric signal on the investigated compartments. The average summer temperature and the growing/thawing degree days were more responsive to heat waves than the phenological indicator (e.g., spring mixing date in lakes) and maximum temperature. We found significant anomalies for both the 2015 and 2022 heat waves across almost all compartments and indicators. Lakes tended to amplify atmospheric temperatures (especially in 2022) whereas rockwalls and soils tended to buffer them. However, residues from the relationship between compartment and atmospheric temperatures were large during heat waves, suggesting that these events may reduce the compartments’ buffering capacity. Our study underscores the importance of long-term monitoring of microthermal conditions to provide a more integrative assessment of mountain ecosystem response to extreme meteorological events.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Central Europe is projected to lose up to 25% of its crop productivity by 2050 because of climate change, posing significant challenges to agricultural systems and food security. Effective adaptation strategies must consider not only domestic impacts but also global climate effects, including international trade dynamics. We performed a multilevel analysis of climate change impacts on agriculture, using the Czech Republic, a landlocked, crop production-based economy with an open market, as a case study. We integrated the global biosphere management model (GLOBIOM) with the gridded global crop model EPIC-IIASA. Climate impacts were projected with five global circulation models under three climate scenarios, with and without CO 2 fertilization, and applied in national, EU-regional, and global productivity change scenarios. The results show that national-only assessments underestimate both risks and opportunities: production is projected to decline by up to 9% when global interactions are excluded but to increase by up to 8% when trade and market effects are included. Autonomous adaptation mechanisms, such as cropland reallocation, shifts in management intensity, and trade adjustments, buffer biophysical yield losses and improve economic outcomes. Neglecting global interactions in national climate change assessments increases the risk of maladaptation and policy inefficiencies. The incorporation of international market linkages enhances the ability to design robust adaptation strategies, enabling countries such as the Czech Republic to maximize resilience while minimizing environmental and socioeconomic trade-offs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Financial incentives are a promising intervention to promote healthier behaviours and potentially reduce health inequalities. Despite robust evidence supporting their effectiveness in encouraging actions such as smoking cessation, increased physical activity, and improved diet, large-scale implementation of financial incentives in Europe remains limited. This perspective identifies three key challenges impeding their broader use: (1) difficulties in reaching the populations most in need, (2) short-lived behavioural effects after removal of the incentives, and (3) uncertainty about sustainable and equitable funding. Drawing on interdisciplinary evidence, we explore potential solutions such as tailored incentive design, strategies to prolong behavioural change (e.g. intermittent reinforcement or dynamic phase-outs), and the development of public or private funding models. We argue that while financial incentives should not replace structural health policy interventions, they can be a powerful complementary tool. A coordinated research agenda is needed to inform scalable and effective implementation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The urgent need to reduce the substantial and persistent incidence of higher education dropout, especially during the first academic year, calls for further research to identify the core predictors of students’ withdrawal intentions and actual behaviors. Specifically, more research is needed to assess whether and how students’ personal resources and academic attitudes interplay in shaping this phenomenon. This study addresses these questions by examining the unexplored joint role of students’ mental toughness and academic satisfaction in counteracting their intention to leave university at the end of the first year. Data from a sample of 187 first-year undergraduates at a non-residential public university, collected at three measurement points, supported the validity of both variables in predicting dropout intentions, after controlling for the effects of academic performance. The results also indicated that the effect of mental toughness in suppressing dropout intentions does not occur when students are dissatisfied with the university. The main implications of these findings are presented and discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Collaborative Condition Monitoring (CCM) is a novel type of service in manufacturing industries that helps organizations improve machine performance by sharing and analyzing machine data across organizational boundaries. This service requires organizations to share data, and they require data infrastructure that accommodates their organizational and technical requirements. For instance, sharing data with other organizations implies a necessity for implementing data sovereignty policies that help data providers retain control of their data. Data spaces are a prominent type of data infrastructure that serves precisely this purpose – enabling data sharing while upholding data sovereignty and mitigating typical concerns. In this paper, we present a reference architecture for data spaces enabling CCM services. We pursue a design science research approach and integrate edge and cloud layers for seamless data sharing and analysis. With this, we provide (a) a framework that guides CCM data space implementation and (b) an abstract model that is transferable to multiple scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Long-term monitoring schemes provide crucial data on bird population dynamics and serve as an invaluable source for reaching informed conservation decisions. Although it is important to keep field techniques unchanged over time to ensure time-series continuity, methodological improvements are sometimes inevitable to track increasing demands on data quality and representativeness. If the changes are too deep, it is reasonable to open a new scheme and, after some time of overlap, to close the old one. Under these circumstances, it is important to evaluate to what extent the data on population dynamics correspond between the schemes. Here, we performed such an evaluation using data from two common bird monitoring schemes in Czechia (Central Europe): an old scheme running from 1982 to 2024 and a new scheme running since 2018. We calculated annual population indices and trends of 104 species independently for each scheme over the period of scheme overlap (2018–2024) and showed that correspondence between the schemes increased with (i) species’ commonness, (ii) detectability, (iii) preference for farmland habitat, and (iv) migration distance. Moreover, we found that the correspondence improved with the length of the overlap period, but the improvement was modest after 5 years. To our knowledge, our study is the first one testing the factors that may influence the correspondence of population measures between different long-term bird monitoring schemes. These results can be used for designing a new scheme and for the interpretation of species population measures in different schemes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study focused on developing an analytical method to quantify nineteen selected micropollutants (MPs), including pharmaceuticals and personal care products, in complex wastewater matrices. An online solid-phase extraction system coupled with LC–MS/MS was used, and different mobile phase compositions were tested in the chromatographic method. The validated method was subsequently applied to real influent and effluent samples from an anaerobic biological reactor in order to assess MP occurrence and removal behavior. The best results were achieved using a mixture of acetonitrile and methanol (50:50 v:v) with 0.1% formic acid, offering high resolution, ionization efficiency, and sensitivity. The method demonstrated good linearity, low detection limits (sewage: 12–143 ng L −1 ; effluent: 7–45 ng L −1 ), and RSD &lt; 15%. Matrix effects were observed in both influent and effluent samples, leading to signal suppression. Despite this, the method maintained high selectivity and precision. Sewage presented variable MPs’ concentrations, with paracetamol being the most prevalent (12–20 µg L −1 ). Removal efficiencies varied among compounds: paracetamol, parabens, and trimethoprim exhibited high biodegradability (&gt; 80%), whereas diclofenac and carbamazepine were poorly removed (&lt; 20%). Application to real wastewater samples revealed highly variable influent concentrations and compound-dependent removal efficiencies, highlighting both the analytical challenges posed by complex matrices and the relevance of the method for evaluating biological treatment performance.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose To investigate 6-month outcomes in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) switched from intravitreal aflibercept 2 mg to intravitreal aflibercept 8 mg. Study design Retrospective observational study. Methods We reviewed records of consecutive nAMD eyes switched from aflibercept 2 mg to 8 mg. In eyes continuing aflibercept 8 mg, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), treatment intervals, and anatomical/exudative parameters were evaluated at 6 months. In eyes that could not continue, reasons for discontinuation were examined. Results Forty-four eyes from 44 patients were included. At 6 months, 35 eyes (79.5%) continued and 9 (20.5%) discontinued aflibercept 8 mg. Discontinuing eyes had significantly shorter pre-switch treatment intervals and more frequent prior therapies than continuing eyes. In the continuation group, BCVA remained stable (median 0.05 to 0.00 logMAR, P = 0.351), while the treatment interval was significantly extended (median 7.0 to 9.0 weeks, P &lt; 0.001). Central retinal thickness and pigment epithelial detachment height decreased significantly ( P = 0.035 and P = 0.021, respectively). The proportion of eyes with subretinal fluid significantly decreased from 74.3 to 37.1% ( P = 0.003). Of the discontinuations, 4 were due to worsening exudation and 5 to inability to extend to ≥8 weeks as required by labeling. No intraocular inflammation or serious adverse events occurred. Conclusions Switching to aflibercept 8 mg achieved anatomical improvements and longer treatment intervals in ~80% of nAMD cases, suggesting it may be a useful alternative to aflibercept 2 mg. However, continuation may be difficult in refractory cases requiring frequent injections before switching.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Despite advancements in antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Tanzania, adherence remains a challenge, especially among young people living with HIV (YPLHIV) aged 10–24 years. This study, conducted in the Shinyanga region of Tanzania, explored the factors affecting access and adherence to ART among YPLHIV. Access to ART refers to the ability to reach, enroll, and receive HIV care and education; adherence refers to proper use of medications as prescribed. The research employed focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with YPLHIV and their caregivers. Data were transcribed and thematically analyzed using Atlas.ti software. The qualitative data analysis revealed clear categories of barriers and facilitators. Barriers to ART access and adherence included forgetfulness, lack of privacy, family instability, poverty, reflected in lack of food or water. Perceived stigma and discrimination from family, school or community members played a significant role, alongside low participation in adherence support activities. Factors facilitating ART access and adherence included disclosure of HIV status and access to social or emotional support from the family members, peers, teachers, health workers, and community members. These factors may increase knowledge about the risks of treatment failure and drug resistance, help reduce their perceived stigma and discrimination and support treatment continuity. Interventions by health workers, family members, peers, teachers—at individual and social levels—as well as by government and local health authorities—at the policy level—are needed to address the above barriers and facilitators to ART access and adherence among YPLHIV enrolled in HIV care. A pesar de los avances en la terapia antirretroviral (TAR) en Tanzania, la adherencia sigue siendo un desafío, especialmente entre los jóvenes que viven con VIH (JVVHIV) de entre 10 y 24 años. Este estudio, realizado en la región de Shinyanga en Tanzania, exploró los factores que afectan el acceso y la adherencia a la TAR entre los JVVHIV. El acceso a la TAR se refiere a la capacidad de llegar, inscribirse y recibir atención y educación sobre el VIH; la adherencia se refiere al uso adecuado de los medicamentos según lo prescrito. La investigación empleó discusiones en grupos focales y entrevistas en profundidad con los JVVHIV y sus cuidadores. Los datos fueron transcritos y analizados temáticamente utilizando el software Atlas.ti. El análisis cualitativo reveló categorías claras de barreras y facilitadores. Las barreras al acceso y la adherencia a la TAR incluyeron el olvido, la falta de privacidad, la inestabilidad familiar y la pobreza, reflejada en la falta de alimentos o agua. La percepción de estigma y discriminación por parte de familiares, compañeros de escuela o miembros de la comunidad desempeñó un papel significativo, junto con una baja participación en actividades de apoyo a la adherencia. Los factores que facilitan el acceso y la adherencia a la TAR incluyeron la divulgación del estado serológico y el acceso a apoyo social o emocional por parte de familiares, compañeros, maestros, trabajadores de la salud y miembros de la comunidad. Estos factores pueden aumentar el conocimiento sobre los riesgos de fracaso del tratamiento y resistencia a los medicamentos, ayudar a reducir la percepción de estigma y discriminación y apoyar la continuidad del tratamiento. Se necesitan intervenciones por parte de los trabajadores de la salud, familiares, compañeros, maestros—a nivel individual y social—así como por parte del gobierno y las autoridades sanitarias locales—a nivel de políticas—para abordar las barreras y facilitadores mencionados en el acceso y adherencia a la TAR entre los JVVHIV inscritos en cuidados por VIH.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The SCN2A gene encodes the alpha subunit of a voltage-gated sodium channel which is necessary for creating and propagating action potentials in neurons. Impairment of the Na v 1.2 function is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Developmental and Epileptic Encephalopathy, Self-limited Neonatal/Infantile Seizures, and Autism Spectrum Disorder. In this study, we used orthologous sequence comparisons, as well as disease associated variants to analyze their location in the structure of Na v 1.2, with the aim of understanding the impact of genetic variants in the structure of this protein at an evolutionary and clinical level. Our analyses reveal different spatial distribution of interspecific variation where different residues locate preferentially in the first cytoplasmic linker, while disease-associated variants tend to cluster in the voltage-sensing segments of the protein domains. Altogether, these discoveries point to structurally important segments in the Na v 1.2 structure that have been conserved through evolution due to their role in maintaining the function of the channel.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract That people are wealth is a core concept in the history and anthropology of Africa. A claim about value in precolonial social orders, it has also been mobilised to explain economic development in colonial and postcolonial settings. Here I revisit two twentieth-century efforts to link wealth-in-people to economic modernisation. One was made by Nyerere, who argued that precolonial kin-based commitments to work cooperatively were a developmental resource that could substitute for capitalist investment. The second is from Meillassoux, who argued that the persistence of precolonial kin-based production facilitated capitalist development by affording a double-exploitation of labor. The arguments reached different conclusions but relied on a common premise: precolonial wealth-in people was premised on the capacity to labor, and that was its actual or possible contribution to modern development. This premise is anachronistic. The valuation of people as vessels of labor-power is particular to the capitalist social order. It is unlike the valuation of people as persons-in-relationship.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Direct-seeded rice (DSR) is emerging as a sustainable alternative to traditional transplanted systems because of its lower water and labor requirements. However, successful crop establishment under DSR is heavily dependent on early seedling vigor (ESV), a multidimensional trait involving rapid germination, uniform emergence, mesocotyl elongation, and biomass accumulation during the initial growth stage. ESV plays a key role in providing a competitive advantage against weeds and supporting resilience under environmental stress. Despite its agronomic significance, ESV has not been a primary selection trait in conventional rice breeding because of its quantitative nature and complex inheritance. Recent advances in high-throughput phenotyping, physiological trait analysis, functional genomics, QTL mapping, GWAS, and haplotype-based breeding have significantly improved our understanding of the genetic and molecular basis of ESV. Key hormonal regulators, such as gibberellins, abscisic acid, brassinosteroids, and cytokinins, along with biochemical components, such as amylase activity, antioxidant enzymes, and carbohydrate metabolism, contribute substantially to seedling vigor. Marker-assisted selection and the integration of multi-omics data are now enabling the precise introgression of ESV-associated QTLs into elite backgrounds. This review consolidates the current research progress on the physiological, morphological, and biochemical traits of ESV in rice and highlights breeding strategies that harness genetic variability and advanced genomic tools to develop rice cultivars that are well-suited for direct-seeded conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This work investigates the structural and magnetic properties of the off-stoichiometric Heusler alloy Fe₁₁Mn₂Ga₃. X-ray diffraction confirms a face-centered cubic L2₁ structure with significant chemical disorder. Magnetic characterization reveals a complex phase diagram with two distinct transitions: a Curie temperature at T m2 =309 K and a magnetic reorientation at T m1 =167 K, below which antiferromagnetic interactions dominate, evidenced by a reentrant decrease in magnetization. This behavior yields a bifunctional magnetocaloric response, with a direct effect near T m1 and an inverse effect near T m2 . Mössbauer spectroscopy confirms a ferrimagnetic state at room temperature and provides microscopic evidence for the development of non-collinear magnetism at low temperatures. The novelty of these results lies in the consequences of the strong Fe-rich off-stoichiometry, which stabilizes chemical disorder and shifts the balance beteween competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions to unusually high temperatures. The results demonstrate that strategic off-stoichiometry is a powerful tool for stabilizing disordered states and engineering novel magnetic functionality in Heusler alloys.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The density and viscosity of binary mixtures of triethanolamine (TEA) and glycerol were investigated over the full composition range at temperatures from 293.15 K to 323.15 K, under atmospheric pressure. The experimentally measured density and viscosity data were correlated with temperature-dependent equations. The excess molar volume ( V E ) and viscosity deviation ( Δη ) were determined and fitted using the Redlich–Kister polynomial equation. In addition, thermodynamic parameters, including partial molar volumes, apparent molar volumes, and thermal expansion coefficients, were evaluated to provide further insight into the mixing behavior of the system. Negative values of V E and Δη were observed over the entire range of temperatures and compositions investigated, indicating the presence of strong specific interactions between TEA and glycerol molecules. These interactions were further elucidated through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The computational results are consistent with the experimental observations, providing molecular-level support for the non-ideal volumetric and viscosity behavior of the mixtures.",

A detailed analysis is carried out for three different scenarios: clean air (Palau), intermediate emissions (Athens), and large emissions (Beijing). At each location the processes at the surface and at an altitude of 500 m are analysed. The ozone production rate is largest in Beijing, intermediate in Athens and smallest on Palau. Nevertheless, there is net ozone loss at the surface in Beijing because of a strong net conversion of ozone to NO $$_{\\varvec{2}}$$ by freshly emitted NO. The ozone production is dominated by methane oxidation on Palau and by the oxidation of short-lived, i.e. emitted nearby, VOCs (volatile organic compounds) in Beijing, where the strongest individual contributor at the surface is isoprene. Athens represents an intermediate situation. The pathways determined show in detail all intermediate steps of the degradation of individual VOCs, including the interaction with NO $$_{\\varvec{x}}$$ and HO $$_{\\varvec{x}}$$ species, and permit the calculation of the number of ozone molecules formed per VOC molecule consumed. For instance, at the surface in Beijing the average net production of ozone in pathways leading to the full degradation of isoprene (to CO $$_{\\varvec{2}}$$ ) is 10.1 ozone molecules per isoprene molecule consumed. At the same location pathways producing up to 18 ozone molecules per isoprene molecules have been found. However, the rates of these extreme pathways are very small.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome has been primarily described as a disorder of T cell production secondary to thymic hypoplasia. However, there is great complexity in the clinical picture with infections, autoimmunity, and inflammation occurring. Emerging evidence suggests that qualitative T cell dysfunction occurs, and the goal of this study was to utilize single-cell RNA-seq to better define altered gene expression patterns to inform on the mechanisms associated with recurrent infections. Methods We utilized single-cell RNA-seq to define distinct populations in 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome ( N = 13) and controls ( N = 11) as well as within a subcohort of patients with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome and recurrent infections. Results When we analyzed differentially expressed genes, we identified a signature of type I interferons across all cell types. Within the T cell compartment, and particularly within the follicular helper T cells, we identified a senescence signature. The alterations found in T cells were most substantial in the patients with recurrent infection. Conclusions While T cell numbers can often normalize in patients with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, our data indicate significantly altered function as defined by differentially expressed genes and aligned with what is known about T cell senescence. The effect was greatest in the patients with recurrent infection. This would be expected to impact T cell function and may account for ongoing symptoms, reduced B cell maturation, and possibly the risk of immune dysregulation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Blood has long held a central place in both religious symbolism and medical practice, carrying meanings that range from life, purity, and covenant to danger, impurity, and death. This article examines the historical relationship between blood, medicine, and Christian thought, focusing especially on how Christian traditions interpreted the emergence of blood transfusion. The study adopts a historical narrative approach, analyzing primary and secondary sources from Europe and North America. After outlining the theological meanings of blood—covenant, sacrifice, redemption, purity, and danger—the article traces key milestones in the scientific development of transfusion from early modern legends to twentieth-century advances. Particular attention is given to the ways in which various Christian denominations responded to transfusion as it entered clinical practice. While Catholic, Orthodox, Anglican, Lutheran, Reformed, and Methodist communities gradually embraced transfusion as a legitimate therapeutic act aligned with principles of charity and the preservation of life, other groups, most notably Jehovah’s Witnesses, adopted a restrictive interpretation of biblical texts that led to the rejection of transfusion and generated significant ethical and legal debates. By integrating medical history with theological perspectives, this article demonstrates that the reception of transfusion within Christian cultures was shaped not only by scientific progress but also by enduring religious understandings of blood as a symbol of life, redemption, and moral responsibility.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Bioaugmentation is a promising strategy to enhance biological wastewater treatment by introducing functional microbial strains that improve pollutant degradation and nutrient removal. However, the practical success of bioaugmentation is often limited by the washout of introduced bacteria, low colonization efficiency, and competition with native microbial communities. A key challenge is the lack of natural aggregation or biofilm-forming ability in many functional strains, making them vulnerable to operational stresses and system perturbations. Although conventional immobilization techniques have been applied to improve microbial retention, these approaches can be costly and may reduce microbial activity. Aerobic granules, highly structured microbial aggregates known for their strong settling properties, dense architecture, and intrinsic stability, have recently emerged as a valuable source of naturally aggregating and biofilm-forming bacteria. These granule-derived microorganisms exhibit functional traits that support biological immobilization, enhancing the persistence and performance of introduced strains. Acting as bridging microorganisms, they promote coaggregation and physical integration with functional bacteria, facilitating biofilm formation and supporting community stability. Although several case studies highlight the potential of these bacteria in improving bioaugmentation outcomes, a comprehensive exploration of their functional traits, ecological interactions, and engineering applications remains limited. This review systematically examines recent advances in bioaugmentation strategies using aggregating bacteria, particularly those derived from aerobic granules, elucidating their mechanisms of action and role in supporting microbial persistence and synergy. By focusing on their capacity to promote microbial immobilization and integration in engineered systems, this work highlights a promising direction for improving bioaugmentation performance. The review identifies key research gaps and provides a framework for designing more resilient and effective microbial strategies for wastewater treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The occurrence of muscle degeneration in fish populations is increasing globally and is often characterised by fillets of unusual presentation, referred to as 'jellied' or 'mushy'.These conditions have been reported to affect a range of species and locations. The causes often vary and typically impact only a relatively small number of individuals. We report on the recent emergence of a condition, milky-white flesh syndrome (MWFS), in a commercially and recreationally important species in New Zealand (Aotearoa), the Australasian snapper ( Chrysophrys auratus ; tāmure). MWFS was first observed in 2019 (affecting 5–50% of captured snapper) on the northeast coast of New Zealand, with affected fish characterised as emaciated with 'mushy' white fillets. We utilise the epidemiological triad to evaluate contributing factors and demonstrate that MWFS may result from the combined effects of dietary deficiency, environmental change, and host susceptibility. Five avenues of future research are proposed: 1. Examination of patterns and trends in affected snapper, relating to condition indices and energy deficits. 2. Examination of nutritional composition of affected snapper through the assessment of taxonomic contribution to gut content. 3. Nutritional profile of affected snapper ascertained through identification of macronutrients, fatty acids (FAs), and associated dietary markers. 4. Physiological analyses to determine significant contributors to the pathology. 5. Determination of the reversibility of this condition. These research priorities will help define causality, leading to clearer management considerations for MWFS and comparable conditions. Additionally, this work will demonstrate the impacts of environmental change in the southern hemisphere through the contribution to pathology.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The development and diffusion of climate technologies is crucial for achieving ambitious environmental targets. The Paris Agreement commits its members to develop strategies for achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the second half of the century. Enterprises across different sectors play an important role in achieving these targets. Using the Y02 patent classification, this study proposes three metrics to quantify and assess the extent to which organisations contribute to developing technologies needed to combat climate change. The metrics include (i) one for the climate patent portfolio size (CPPS) of relevant technologies, (ii) the strength of the organisation’s climate technology related inventions, including a climate technology contribution index (CTCI), and (iii) a metric to assess the degree of specialisation, i.e. the degree to which organisations contribute narrowly or broadly to the development of climate technologies. We apply the metrics to a sample of the 104 most innovative organisations globally. Results indicate a strong sector dependence as well as stark differences across the top innovative global companies along all three metrics. The share of climate inventions within the organisations’ patent portfolios – represented by CPPS rel – varies from nearly 0.23% to 46.6%. Similarly, the CTCI and CSI scores varied across organisations, shedding further light on sector-specific characteristics. While these initial results are encouraging, we suggest the metrics to be tested further and further developed, e.g. to allow for more valid assessments for small- and medium-sized enterprises.",

    "Abstract": "The generation of engineered neurons via Neurogenin-2 (NGN2) overexpression, starting from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), is a powerful tool for modeling neurological diseases. However, using stabilized hiPSCs as a starting point significantly increases the time required to obtain a valuable human neuronal model in vitro. Here, we demonstrated that as little as 3 days of transient expression of reprogramming factors in human fibroblasts can unlock the ability of these cells to transdifferentiate into neurons upon overexpression of NGN2. We used single-cell transcriptomic data to dissect the distinct cell identities that emerge during reprogramming. We identified three distinct reprogramming intermediate populations responsive to NGN2-mediated neuronal induction and found that partial reprogramming for only 3 days is sufficient to mediate NGN2 neuronal conversion of human fibroblasts. Moreover, we found that the efficiency in neuronal fate acquisition mediated by NGN2 overexpression is strictly correlated with the stage of reprogramming used as a starting point.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Temporomandibular joint tumors are rare entities that often go unnoticed; however, they are the cause of multiple severe facial asymmetries. Aim The study aims to present cases of rare temporomandibular joint tumors as an alternative cause of facial asymmetry. Materials and methods This is a retrospective longitudinal study with a literature review, including a consecutive sample of all TMJ procedures, ultimately aimed at investigating joint tumors that cause joint symptoms and severe facial asymmetry. The inclusion criteria were subjects with facial asymmetry and joint symptoms. The exclusion criteria were facial asymmetries caused by condylar hyperplasia. All patients were initially evaluated by clinical examination. Based on the clinical characteristics, diagnostic images, such as CT, MRI, and bone gammagraphy, were requested. Subsequently, the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathology. The following information was gathered: final diagnosis, age, gender, clinical presentation, tumor size, treatment method, recurrence, and vital status. Results Finally, 7 cases of TMJ tumors were obtained, with patients between the ages of 12 and 65 (38.8) years. The sample includes diagnoses such as osteoma, medullary osteoma, osteochondroma, chondroma, and synovial chondromatosis. Conclusion TMJ tumors are sporadic and generally predominantly benign. They can cause severe facial asymmetry due to slow growth, but may also cause significant asymmetry once they reach a critical size. Therefore, their management should be comprehensive, including tumor resection and correction of facial and occlusal asymmetry.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) represent the host immune response and may influence metastatic behavior in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Objective To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of stromal TILs in predicting clinical and pathological lymph node metastasis in OSCC. Methods Analytical cross-sectional study including 170 OSCC patients. Stromal TILs were quantified on H&amp;E sections and classified into high vs. low groups. Their association with clinical nodal staging and pathological nodal metastasis was studied. ROC analysis assessed predictive performance. Results Low stromal TILs were significantly associated with pathological nodal metastasis ( p &lt; 0.001) and with clinical nodal positivity ( p &lt; 0.001). Among clinically N0 patients, 76.9% of occult nodal metastasis occurred in low-TIL tumors. ROC analysis showed moderate accuracy overall (AUC 0.603) and better performance in N0 patients (AUC 0.676). Conclusion Stromal TILs are inversely associated with nodal metastasis in OSCC and may improve the accuracy of clinical nodal staging, especially in N0 disease.",

    "Abstract": "Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), a herpesvirus closely linked to multiple types of lymphoma, promotes tumorigenesis through various mechanisms, including inducing genomic instability, reprogramming key signaling pathways, and evading host immune surveillance. In Burkitt Lymphoma (BL), aberrant activation of the MYC gene is recognized as a pivotal driver event, while recent reports indicate that EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) and latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) significantly enhance tumor cell proliferation and immune evasion by regulating host chromatin structure and antigen presentation processes. In Diffuse Large B cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) and Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL), EBV latent proteins such as LMP1 and latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) activate the NF-κB and JAK/STAT signaling pathways, reshaping the tumor microenvironment, enhancing anti-apoptotic survival signals, and promoting immune suppression. Furthermore, EBV-encoded microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) further modulate host gene expression and metabolic pathways, increasing tumor heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. Despite advances in targeting MYC, the PI3K/AKT pathway, and immune checkpoints, issues such as resistance, high toxicity, and the complexity of the tumor microenvironment limit their clinical applicability. Emerging immunotherapies, including CAR-T cell therapy, EBV-specific T-cell therapy, and epigenetic targeting, show significant potential in optimizing the immune microenvironment and overcoming therapeutic resistance. However, the molecular heterogeneity of EBV-associated lymphomas poses greater challenges for precision medicine strategies. Future research needs to integrate multi-omics data to elucidate the complex molecular interactions between EBV and its host, laying the groundwork for the development of multi-targeted combinatorial therapies and innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This review systematically summarizes the core mechanisms by which EBV contributes to lymphoma pathogenesis and evaluates the breakthroughs and challenges of current therapeutic strategies. It also outlines the future directions of precision medicine, based on multi-disciplinary integration, to enhance the understanding of the molecular pathology of EBV-associated lymphomas and optimize personalized treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Various challenges including cultural concerns, the shortage of Diné (Navajo) scientists and scientists with cultural competence to engage with Diné communities, and the need for rigorous policies regarding genetic research led to the establishment of a moratorium on genetic research within the Navajo Nation in 2002. Previous surveys with Diné interest holders highlighted ongoing uncertainty about lifting the moratorium and underscored the need for further community consultation and education. Deliberative democratic engagement has been an effective approach for exploring Indigenous community values regarding genomic research. To assess perspectives on genetic research and inform future policy, we conducted a two-day virtual deliberation with 17 research and healthcare professionals associated with the Navajo Nation, including Diné (n = 15) and non-Diné (n = 2) deliberants. Deliberants varied in their knowledge of genetics (n = 5 reported knowing \"a lot\"; n = 12 \"a little bit\"), and a majority (n = 13) were aware of the moratorium. Two overarching themes, \"life and history experiences\" and \"values,\" emerged, reflecting how personal and professional backgrounds, alongside individual and collective standards, shaped deliberants' views on genetic research and its practices. Subthemes within these categories offered deeper insights into their perspectives. Although deliberants expressed caution regarding exploratory genetic studies, there was interest in using genetic research to advance individualized healthcare. Deliberants' concerns emphasized the need for a robust genetic research policy that prioritizes Diné culture, community interests, public health and wellbeing, and the sovereignty of the Navajo Nation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are therapies for type 2 diabetes whose use expanded sharply after semaglutide’s 2021 approval for obesity. Although gastrointestinal effects are well described, national patterns of acute GLP-1 RA exposures are poorly characterized. This study evaluated trends in GLP-1 RA exposures reported to U.S. poison centers, focusing on demographic shifts, exposure circumstances, and clinical outcomes before and after the 2021 FDA approval. Methods We analyzed human GLP-1 RA exposures reported to the National Poison Data System from 2012 to 2023, using July 1, 2021, to define pre- and post-approval periods. Demographics, exposure characteristics, therapies, and medical outcomes were compared using standardized statistical tests. Quarterly call counts were modeled with segmented Poisson regression to assess changes in reporting trajectory. Results A total of 10,033 exposures were identified (3,113 pre-approval; 6,920 post-approval). Semaglutide predominated post-approval (64.2%). The exposed population shifted younger and more female. Most cases were unintentional therapeutic errors with mild gastrointestinal symptoms. The proportion managed in or referred to a health care facility increased from 23.0% to 33.5% (RR = 1.46, [95% CI: 1.36, 1.57], p &lt; 0.001). Segmented Poisson modeling demonstrated a significant inflection in call volume, with semaglutide exposures increasing an additional 9.9% per quarter after approval. Conclusions GLP-1 RA exposures rose sharply following semaglutide’s weight-loss approval, accompanied by increased health care utilization despite generally mild clinical effects. Although multiple factors likely contributed to these trends, improved patient counseling and clearer poison center guidance may help reduce preventable therapeutic errors and unnecessary emergency evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper examines the impact of a 22% minimum wage increase in Spain on January 2019 on intimate partner violence using a doubly robust difference-in-differences strategy with inverse probability weighting and the nationally representative Spanish Survey of Violence Against Women. We find no effect of the reform on physical or sexual violence. However, treated women—those with a high predicted probability of working at minimum wage jobs—experienced a 42% increase in psychological violence. Labor market analysis of survey respondents reveals that the reform led to a substitution away from female employment toward her partner’s employment, reducing women’s bargaining power within the household. For women whose partner is five years older, the increase in violence is not accompanied with lower female labor market engagement, providing evidence of alternative mechanisms, such as disrupted gender roles, or instrumental violence. These findings highlight unintended consequences of wage policy and highlight the need for complementary policies and services addressing the dangers of gender-based and domestic violence.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We consider effect of particle loss on the current in a system of an Aharonov-Bohm ring with an embedded quantum dot. In the system, the particle loss is assumed to occur at the ends of normal conducting lead and the quantum dot. The Keldysh Green’s function method is extended to the dissipative system, the formula of nonequilibrium current is derived. The effect of particle loss on differential conductance is examined numerically. Although the phase shift in differential conductance does not occur in the presence of particle loss, the particle loss at both ends of the lead reduces differential conductance. By contrast, the particle loss at a quantum dot widens the resonant curve of the differential conductance, and reduces the maximum value. In the presence of Coulomb interaction, the Hartree-Fock approximation is employed. Although the differential conductance has double peaks because of the stepwise total occupation number of the quantum dot, the effect of particle loss on differential conductance is the same as that in the absence of Coulomb interaction. The validity of our calculation method is discussed by referring to previous literature.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The regenerative ability of the skin is orchestrated by different types of cells, including mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). Their role in wound healing is being widely studied due to their capacity to produce a secretome able to modulate their microenvironment. In this context, MSCs factors can be isolated using in vitro cell culture and be experimentally tested for a series of clinical conditions, such as skin repair. In this study, we produced conditioned medium (MSC-CM) using primary cultures from human adipose-derived MSCs. This medium was used as treatment in a culture of keratinocytes cell line from adult human skin (HaCaT) to investigate the modulation of their dynamics. We analyzed cell proliferation, migration, and changes on cell morphology by labeling the actin filaments and nuclei. The factors released by MSCs were able to improve both the proliferation and migration of keratinocytes. In addition, there was an increase in the amount of actin stress fibers, filopodia protrusions, and nuclei irregularities. The MSCs secretome modified the migratory patterns of keratinocytes, being observable through their morphological changes. At least in part, this modulation was caused by the TGF-β1 signaling, considering that its antagonist, SB 431542, lead to a reduction of approximately 76% in the migration of HaCaT cells through the porous membranes of transwell chambers. Together, our data contribute to a better understanding of the role of MSCs on keratinocytes during wound healing and reinforce the importance to investigate their potential in dermal regeneration therapies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In course of investigating the endophytic and nematode-associated fungus Polydomus karssenii for the production of secondary metabolites, seven previously undescribed natural products were isolated from liquid and solid-state fermentations. 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, together with HR-ESI–MS data, enabled the elucidation of the planar structures of 3-decalinoyltetramic acids polydosetins A–E ( 1 – 5 ) and cyclodepsipeptides pullularins G and H ( 6 and 7 ). The relative configurations of the decalin moiety of 1 – 5 were determined based on ROESY correlations and 1 H– 1 H coupling constants. The configuration of the side chains was established through a detailed J -resolved analysis (Murata’s method) in combination with chemical shift comparison to model compounds. Absolute stereochemistry of 1 – 5 was assigned based on ECD data, and confirmed by Mosher’s method utilizing 3 . Finally, the absolute configuration of amino acid residues in 6 and 7 was determined through advanced Marfey’s method. Bioassays revealed that compounds 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 were active against Gram-positive bacteria, 3 and 5 exhibited antifungal activity, and 1 and 2 showed nematicidal effects. These results underscore the untapped chemical potential of P. karssenii and highlight the importance of exploring nematode-associated fungi as sources of new natural products with potential antimicrobial and nematicidal properties.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA)-positive vasculitis frequently affects the kidney and the lung, with alveolar hemorrhage being fatal. Whereas aggressive immunosuppressive therapies are conventionally used, recent studies have shown the beneficial effect of avacopan, a C5a antagonist, as an alternative to glucocorticoids for ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV). In patients with pulmonary hemorrhage and severe respiratory failure, however, neither the efficacy of avacopan nor the contribution of this drug to early withdrawal of glucocorticoids is fully qualified. Here, we report a case of AAV presenting with alveolar hemorrhage requiring aggressive ventilatory support in which we experienced the favorable effect of early use of avacopan. A 31-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of a two-week history of blood sputum and positive MPO-ANCA. His respiratory failure deteriorated rapidly, necessitating both mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A combination therapy with glucocorticoids and rituximab was initiated and avacopan was started on hospital day 8, which resulted in successful remission within six months of admission (Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score version 3 = 0), and the beneficial effect was sustained for at least 6 months following the discontinuation of glucocorticoid withdrawal (day 156). Thus, avacopan, in combination with immunosuppressives, may not only help suppress the disease activity of AAV but also facilitate early withdrawal of glucocorticoids even in case of life-threatening respiratory failure.",

    "Abstract": "Uncontrolled gout (UG) is a progressive arthropathy that develops as a consequence of sustained hyperuricemia. Recombinant uricases can profoundly lower serum urate (SU) and reverse the clinical manifestations of uncontrolled gout. However, therapeutic uricases are highly immunogenic and can provoke the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), resulting in a loss of effect and potentially severe allergic reactions. Pegloticase is currently the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved uricase indicated for the treatment of UG. The Food and Drug Administration recently approved the co-administration of methotrexate with pegloticase to inhibit ADA formation and enhance the efficacy and tolerability of pegloticase. Nanoencapsulated sirolimus plus pegadricase (NASP) is a novel every-4-week treatment delivered as a sequential two-component infusion consisting of nanoencapsulated sirolimus immediately followed by pegadricase, a novel PEGylated uricase. NASP mitigates ADA formation by promoting uricase-specific immunotolerance, thereby obviating the need for systemic immunomodulatory drugs. Phase I trials demonstrated that NASP inhibited ADA development, allowing sustained pegadricase control and SU lowering for up to 30 days. The dose-finding (phase II) study showed NASP (nanoencapsulated sirolimus 0.1-0.15 mg/kg and pegadricase 0.2 mg/kg) reduced ADA development and supported durable SU lowering. The phase II COMPARE trial demonstrated that monthly NASP was as effective as twice-monthly pegloticase in achieving SU targets at 6 months. Combined phase III DISSOLVE trial data confirmed that NASP significantly lowered SU and increased SU responses in participants with UG. All phase I-III trials demonstrated that NASP was generally well tolerated with no specific safety signals. Overall, NASP has demonstrated robust and durable SU lowering, which ultimately reduced disease burden, supporting positive health-related quality-of-life outcomes. This review summarizes the clinical development of NASP with particular reference to the targeted immunotolerizing strategy that diminishes its immunogenicity. Video abstract available online.

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study introduces a dynamic customer visit scheduling problem of a salesperson. The aim of the salesperson is to make frequent visits to the customers by prioritizing the customers with higher urgency levels. The urgency levels of the customers are subject to change depending on new information about their willingness to make a future purchase. The updated information about the customer urgency level is obtained by visiting the customer or by receiving an urgent call from the customer. To accommodate the changes in the customer urgency levels, the customer visits need to be rescheduled. In this regard, we propose a rescheduling framework for the problem. The proposed framework consists of two integer programming formulations, namely, scheduling and rescheduling models. The scheduling model generates a baseline customer visit schedule. The rescheduling model is employed to develop new customer visit schedule by considering the stability of certain visits. To control the timing of rescheduling decisions, we considered two alternative rescheduling policies, namely, periodic and event-driven rescheduling policies. An application of the proposed framework is presented on a case study of the customer visit scheduling in a vehicle manufacturer. The computational results reveal that the proposed framework with periodic rescheduling policy provides efficient visit schedules under the schedule stability constraints.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we investigate the local vertex energy of trees, a spectral invariant that quantifies the contribution of individual vertices to the total energy of a graph. Inspired by questions posed in recent work on local energy, we investigate this quantity in two structured families: broom trees and double-star trees. For broom trees, we identify the vertices that attain maximal and minimal local energy, both within a fixed broom and across the class of all brooms with a given number of vertices. While the general case of double-broom trees remains open due to the complex behavior of vertices along the central path, we provide a complete solution for the subclass of double-star trees. These results enhance the overall understanding of vertex-level energy distribution and encourage further developments in the spectral analysis of trees.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Seed priming has emerged as a promising technique to improve seed germination and plant growth under water-limited conditions. However, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in seed priming, particularly those related to post-dehydration processes and the subsequent acquisition of stress memory, remains limited. Thus, this study aimed to gain a better understanding of the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) seed priming on germination and the transfer of stress memory from seeds to the vegetative stage (V4) of soybean plants, with impacts on plant growth, osmotic regulation, and oxidative stress under conditions of osmotic stress and rehydration. Therefore, an experiment was conducted using different concentrations of H 2 O 2 (0, 10, 50, 100, and 200 mM) for soybean seed priming under osmotic stress conditions. Subsequently, parameters related to seed germination, oxidative stress, osmotic adjustment, and seedling growth were assessed. Based on improved seed germination, seedling growth, and oxidative stress of seeds submitted to osmotic stress, the concentration of 10 mM of H 2 O 2 was chosen as the most promising for a subsequent experiment aiming to evaluate the effects of seed priming on soybean plants exposed to water restriction, followed by rehydration. The induction of stress memory in response to the seed priming was assessed by evaluating soil moisture, relative water content and leaf water potential, plant growth, proline accumulation, pigment, H 2 O 2 , and malondialdehyde content at the V4 stage. The evaluations were carried out at 0, 4, and 8 days after stress imposition and after a period of four days of rehydration. Seed priming with 10 mM H 2 O 2 slowed the water potential reduction, induced root growth, and reduced the content of proline and H 2 O 2 in stressed plants, although it did not avoid the reduction of pigments and increasing oxidative stress. We have successfully demonstrated the positive effects of H 2 O 2 seed priming inducing tolerance “stress memory” in soybean at the vegetative stage (V4).",

    "Abstract": "Abstract For people with dementia, meaningful engagement with preferred activities is a vital component in maintaining quality of life. Preference assessments have been found to identify preferred and reinforcing stimuli for people with dementia. However, because they have been predominantly validated for individuals with intellectual or developmental disabilities, there are likely aspects of the assessment that need to be adapted. We implemented standard stimulus preference assessments for four people with dementia, and designed some adaptations based on objective measures of their choice, affect, verbal responding, and the input of the participants. We then compared the standard and the adapted versions in a multielement design. We found that both the standard and adapted assessments resulted in similar selections of stimuli. We observed an increase in indices of happiness and a decrease in indices of unhappiness for three out of four participants during the adapted version compared to the standard version. Family, staff, and the people with dementia reported both the standard and adapted preference assessments to be socially valid. One participant reported better understanding what they were being asked to do in the adapted assessment, and a staff member reported the adapted assessment to be more effective. We also found a decrease in the frequency of statements that were off-topic, socially polite, or about items being “sold” to them across all four participants in the adapted assessment. We further extended the work of Reid and Green (1996) by incorporating indices of confusion to capture a broader range of affect. On the basis of our results, we give some examples of how to make preference assessments more acceptable for people with dementia.",

These mental health challenges can negatively influence student academic and socioemotional functioning in the school setting. To better understand student and staff mental health in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, 15 secondary-level staff members participated in semi-structured interviews to gain a nuanced understanding of current mental health needs and the multidirectional relationship between student and staff mental health, the effects of COVID-19 on student socioemotional, psychological, and academic outcomes, and educator response to balancing and addressing mental health needs in their school. Utilizing reflexive thematic analysis, four main themes emerged: (1) the Mental Health Needs of Students Are “Varied and Vast”; (2) Student Mental Health Has Broad Impacts; (3) the Impact of the Pandemic Broadly Influenced Students and Staff; and (4) Staff Struggle To Manage their Own Mental Health Needs in Relation To, and in Addition To, Student Mental Health Needs. Each theme also elicited several subthemes to further elucidate understanding of the educators’ perspectives. Study limitations and implications for practice are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Various metal oxide catalysts have been utilized to enhance the electrode reaction kinetics in vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB). However, the determining factor governing their catalysis is still insufficiently understood. Herein, selectively doping of Sr and Ce at La site of LaMnO 3 perovskite (LSMO and LCMO) was used to modulate chemical environments of Mn ion activity donors, thereby boosting vanadium redox reaction processes. Sr doping increases the valence state of Mn ions, making it easier for Mn ions to take an electron from the electrode and transfer it to V 3+ ions, which lowers the reaction energy barrier of V 3+ /V 2+ redox processes. Conversely, Ce doping decreases the Mn valence and increases the oxygen vacancies, boosting the charge transfer and mass transfer of VO 2+ /VO 2 + redox processes. Theoretical calculation further demonstrates that doping Sr and Ce enhances the vanadium ion’s ability for charge transfer and adsorption. Compared with pristine VRFB, the VRFB with LSMO- and LCMO-modified anode and cathode, respectively, exhibits an excellent energy efficiency (EE) of 67% at a high current density of 300 mA cm −2 and an increased EE of 15% at 150 mA cm −2 . This study is critical for promoting fundamental understanding and offering a design strategy for achieving superior-performance metal-based electrocatalysts in VRFB.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Solid–liquid interfaces are ubiquitous in nature and engineering, and their frictional behavior remains a key factor limiting performance gains in surface engineering. However, conventional tribology has largely focused on the effect of macroscopic variables such as surface topography, which do not account for the microscopic essence of ultra-low-friction phenomena at the nanoscale. Recently, the role of quantum-scale excitations, such as electrons and phonons, in micro-/nanoscale solid–liquid friction has been increasingly emphasized. By using in situ detection techniques such as terahertz time-domain spectroscopy and non-contact atomic force microscopy, the quantum-scale friction has been observed. Its essence stems from the energy and momentum transfer induced by fluctuations in liquid charge density or electron or phonon excitations within solids. However, limited capabilities in simultaneously probing multiple physical quantities at sub-nanometer and femtosecond resolutions hinder a comprehensive understanding of the quantum origins and applications of solid–liquid interfacial friction. This review synthesizes the cutting-edge theories and experimental advances in quantum-scale solid–liquid friction and proposes a potential breakthrough path based on deep integration of simulation and experiment to address core gaps, including incomplete theoretical frameworks and constrained detection capabilities. Despite multidimensional challenges, quantum-scale friction research demonstrates substantial potential for transformative technologies, such as low-power nanofluidic devices, high-efficiency energy storage, intelligent drug delivery, and super-lubrication materials, underscoring its significance for the convergence of interfacial science, quantum mechanics, and micro/nanofluidics.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The instantaneous nucleation of Sn originating from the uncontrolled diffusion of Sn 2+ ions typically forms large, electrochemically inactive “dead Sn” that severely constraints the plating/stripping reversibility of Sn anode for acidic aqueous batteries. Herein, nanoscale spatial confinement of Sn 2+ ions is realized in SnSO 4 electrolyte by strategically dictating spontaneous assembly of nanomicelles with amphipathic sulfolane. The as-constructed locally heterogeneous environment ensures the sustainable release of Sn 2+ ions, which reprograms the nucleation manner from instantaneous to progressive modes. The consequent progressive formation of Sn nuclei triggers size refinement of electrodeposited Sn, thereby alleviating the “dead Sn” issue. Meanwhile, the reaction competitivity of Sn 2+ reduction over hydrogen evolution side reaction is effectively strengthened as the consecutive hydrogen bonding network among bulk water is disrupted by the micellar structure. Consequently, Sn anode exerts an unprecedently high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.97% and witnesses a prominent life span extension from 710 to 8400 h (~ 11-fold enhancement). In a dual-plating configuration, the Sn||Mn full battery delivers a 1.6 V discharge plateau and sustains 790 cycles, demonstrating practical feasibility. Our findings underscore the decisive role of the very initial nucleation behavior in regulating metal electrochemistry, applicable to other multivalent anodes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Highly concentrated aqueous electrolytes (HCAEs) offer superior energy density and stability in energy conversion and storage than their diluted counterparts, attributed to enhanced ion transport and correlated ion structures. However, their underlying structure–transport relationships remain poorly understood in wide-temperature and nanoconfinement environments. This study captures electrolyte structure and transport fingerprints shaped by environmental factors, by combining experimental characterization with first-principles molecular simulations at sub-nanometer resolution. It is revealed that ultrahigh concentration changes electrolyte electronic states and forms ion correlation networks with extensive aggregates. These alterations reduce free water content and hydrogen bond network connectivity, resulting in notable deviation from the Nernst–Einstein (NE)-predicted conductivity. This deviation is thermal-alleviated by weakening ion correlations. Nanoconfined interfaces create oscillatory-decaying distribution and heterogeneous orientation in HCAE constituents, resulting in redrawn ion correlation networks and localized NE deviations. Such transport behaviors are further modulated by synergistic thermal-interfacial constraints. Taking NE deviations as descriptors, HCAE transport, mediated by environment-reconstructed ion correlation networks, is then summarized to present threefold-hierarchical variations due to ion concentration, thermal effect, and confinement extent. This threefold-hierarchical framework is transferable among diverse electrolytes, offering a localized insight for electrolyte evaluation in electrochemical energy devices.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study examines how research and development (R&amp;D) activities influence firm efficiency and how human capital moderates his relationship within Taiwan’s 5G industry. Motivated by limited empirical evidence on how R&amp;D translates into operational outcomes through workforce capabilities, the research draws on the resource-based view and human capital theory. A dynamic network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model is applied to evaluate innovation, profitability, and overall efficiency using panel data from 27 publicly listed 5G-concept firms over 2013–2023. Patent data were obtained from the Taiwan Intellectual Property Office, and financial data from the Taiwan Economic Journal, while human capital was measured by the average years of employee service. The findings show that firms with higher innovation efficiency exhibit significantly greater profitability efficiency, and that human capital amplifies this positive relationship. These results highlight the pivotal role of experienced and stable workforces in transforming R&amp;D inputs into profitable outcomes, particularly during periods of technological and environmental uncertainty. Theoretically, the study advances the innovation and efficiency literature by integrating dynamic efficiency measurement with a moderating perspective of human capital. Practically, it underscores the need for strategic investment in workforce retention and development to maximize the returns from R&amp;D. The study’s novelty lies in combining a dynamic network DEA framework with moderation analysis to capture the compounded effects of innovation and human capital in a rapidly evolving high-tech industry.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Groups are inherently dynamic social entities whose function, adaptation, and outcomes are fundamentally driven by continuous changes in individual membership and affiliation patterns. Existing analytical frameworks often treat the group as the primary unit of analysis, overlooking the complexity of individual trajectories within these shifting structures. To address this gap, we introduce a unified, granular framework that shifts the unit of analysis from the group to the individual, formally representing their presence across multiple groups over time. Building on this formalization, we define a comprehensive set of individual-level and affiliation-level metrics to quantify the dynamics of participation. We validate the framework using three real-world datasets from distinct domains: online gaming (Travian) and professional sports (Football and NBA). The empirical results demonstrate the framework’s flexibility and explanatory power, revealing generalizable structural regularities. This framework provides a robust quantitative tool for characterizing and predicting individual behavior within dynamic group systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Imaging spectroscopy enables detailed recording of the Earth’s surface and ecosystems’ properties at a global level. Due to the specifications of the hyperspectral sensors, it becomes possible to utilize the hyperspectral data in a multitude of applications, among which the mapping, monitoring and understanding of land use and land cover (LULC). The Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) is a German satellite mission that aims to monitor and characterize the Earth’s surface on a global scale providing high-quality data with the advantage of open access. This study explores the capabilities of the EnMAP satellite in LULC mapping. The goal of the study is to leverage the advantages and potential of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, in particular of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), in combination with EnMAP’s hyperspectral data, for mapping LULC. The study area is characterized as a typical Mediterranean environment. The thematic LULC maps accuracy was assessed using statistical methods and further analysis was conducted through McNemar’s statistical test to evaluate the statistical significance of the differences in the results. All in all, the SVM algorithm proved to be more accurate than RF algorithm, with an overall accuracy of 91% compared to 86%, respectively. The McNemar’s test confirmed the higher accuracy of the SVM algorithm’s results, at least this was the case in our study. The study’s findings highlighted EnMAP’s hyperspectral data promising role of in the field of LULC classification. This study adds valuable information towards evaluating EnMAP satellite data in producing thematic maps in typical Mediterranean environments and allows for comparisons with similar data sets in other areas or with data from other sensors in similar environments.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Recruiting and retaining science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) college students is essential given the rising demand for professionals in these fields. Motivational climates in STEM labs, specifically caring and task-involving environments, may positively impact students’ college experiences. This study investigated whether perceptions of the motivational climate in biology labs impacted factors including students’ eagerness to attend lab, excitement for their major, preparation for future courses, belief in instructor support, and peer relationships. A total of 894 students completed end-of-semester surveys measuring their perceptions of their biology lab motivational climate and learner-related motivational outcomes. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare caring versus non-caring and task-involving versus non-task-involving lab climates at individual and group levels. Most students reported moderately high caring and high task-involving climates and neutral adaptive learning responses. Individually, students perceiving both a caring and task-involving climate scored significantly higher across all outcomes. When grouped by section, outcome variables showed higher trends and some significant differences for the caring and task-involving groups. Findings highlight that perceptions of a caring, task-involving lab climate may enhance students’ learning experiences, potentially improving retention and graduation rates. Instructors play a pivotal role in fostering such climates, which can enhance STEM educational outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study provides a comprehensive characterization of advanced lightweight Hybrid Metal Foams (HMFs) based on Lightweight Expanded Clay Aggregate (LECA) particles. The investigation includes detailed microstructural analysis and mechanical property evaluation to elucidate the matrix-dependent behavior of the newly developed HMFs. All HMFs display a dense matrix-LECA interface, with AlSi7Mg-HMF featuring a thin Mg-enriched interface, while AlSi12 and Al99.5 HMFs present typical elemental transitions. The results show that the AlSi7Mg-HMF outperforms AlSi12 and Al99.5, highlighting significant matrix effects on compressive properties. The HMFs exhibit distinct behaviors, with AlSi7Mg and Al99.5 matrices displaying a strain hardening plateau, whereas AlSi12-HMF shows strain softening during compression. Furthermore, the alloyed matrices (AlSi7Mg and AlSi12) fail through brittle shear band fractures, while the non-alloyed Al99.5 matrix undergoes ductile deformation, characterized by a barrel-shaped collapse without cracking. Notably, the AlSi7Mg-HMF sets a new performance benchmark for metal foams with densities below 1.6 g/cm 3 . These findings underscore the critical influence of matrix composition on the compressive behavior and failure mechanisms of HMFs. The results contribute to the understanding of these advanced materials, offering a foundation for their further optimization in engineering applications.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Carrier-assisted delivery is a key step for the successful targeted oral delivery of bioactive molecules in functional diets in livestock. The aim is to protect the biomolecule during gastric transit, and ensure its efficient release in the intestine. Biochar is the by-product of the thermochemical conversion of residual biomass in an oxygen-limited environment and has suitable physico-chemical and morphological properties to be a carrier. Two types of biochar were tested as carriers of egg white lysozyme (LY), selected as a representative of bioactive molecules both in terms of molecular size (MW 14.3 kDa) and antibacterial activity, for application in weaned pig feed. One biochar was derived from chestnut shells (CB) and the other from vine pruning (VB). An efficient and environmentally-friendly procedure for LY adsorption was developed, based on a solid/liquid process in mild conditions. The effects of the operating conditions, such as initial LY content, reaction time, and pH were also studied. The optimal conditions were found to be a maximum LY loading of 21–23 mg LY g Carrier −1 . Both pristine and hybrid materials were extensively characterized by combining morphological and physico-chemical techniques to obtain information on LY allocation and interactions with the carriers. Preliminary experiments on lysozyme release were performed at pH = 3 and pH = 7, simulating the pH conditions of the stomach and intestine of the weaned pigs, respectively. The results showed a higher releasing capacity when the pH was increased from 3 to 7. Specifically, the release showed a slight increase from 0.8% to 1.2% as the pH shifted from 3 to 7 for CB, and from 1.5% to 2.3% for VB. These results confirmed that biochar can protect LY from the low pH, during the gastric transit, and that LY could be released in the gut. These two benefits are likely related to the homogeneous distribution of LY molecules at the carrier surface, which is facilitated by the interaction of charges of opposite signs.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Acidic soils are global hotspots of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions, and biochar has been proposed as a promising mitigation strategy. However, most current evidence comes from short-term studies, and the legacy effects and underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we collected acidic soil samples from three sites with and without biochar application, representing short-term (3 and 5 years) and long-term (9 years) legacy effects. Using microcosm incubations, isotope-based source partitioning, and microbial analyses, we evaluated N 2 O dynamics and their microbial drivers. The short-term legacy effects of biochar significantly reduced N 2 O emissions by inhibiting gross N 2 O production and enhancing N 2 O reduction. This was primarily attributed to reduced nitrification-derived N 2 O, increased nos Z gene abundance, and enrichment of taxa carrying the nos Z gene, such as Rhodanobacter and Gemmatimonas . In contrast, long-term legacy effects markedly increased N 2 O emissions because biochar suppressed N 2 O reduction more strongly than its production. This was linked to reduced nos Z abundance, increased fungal denitrification, and depletion of dissolved organic carbon and denitrifying bacteria. Together, these findings reveal that the legacy effects of biochar on N 2 O emissions diverge over time, driven by changes in microbial nitrogen cycling pathways. These results underscore the importance of incorporating temporal and microbial perspectives when evaluating the long-term climate impacts of biochar and developing sustainable soil management strategies.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The present study investigated the combined effects of zofenoprilat (ZOFE) and nebivolol (NEBI) on endothelial function, focusing on their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. The purpose was to evaluate whether these drugs, commonly used in clinical practice, offer a synergistic therapeutic strategy for managing hypertension and protecting vascular health. ZOFE, an ACE inhibitor, demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory activities by reducing inflammatory cytokines, thereby mitigating vascular inflammation, a key factor in hypertension and atherosclerosis. NEBI, a third-generation beta-blocker, exhibited strong antioxidant effects by enhancing nitric oxide (NO) levels, crucial for maintaining endothelial function and reducing oxidative stress. Methods The potential effect of ZOFE and NEBI treatment was evaluated using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as a model. Specifically, cells were challenged with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) to induce endothelial dysfunction. Subsequently, cell viability, NO production, protein levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), enzymatic activity of SOD and CAT, intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH), inflammatory status, and levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1 (MIC-1), and the active form of nuclear factor kappa B (p-NFκB), were analyzed. Results Our results showed that NEBI significantly counteracted oxidative stress, increasing the main antioxidant defenses (SOD, CAT, and GSH). The combination of ZOFE and NEBI resulted in a potentiated effect, enhancing both anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. This dual mechanism of action provides a comprehensive approach to protecting endothelial cells and improving vascular function. The combined therapy not only lowered blood pressure more effectively but also offered greater protection against endothelial damage compared to monotherapy with either drug alone. These findings suggest that the combination of ZOFE and NEBI could be particularly beneficial for patients with hypertension, especially those with coexisting inflammatory and oxidative stress-related conditions. Conclusions This combination therapy, by addressing multiple pathogenic pathways simultaneously, could potentially be beneficial in patients with cardiovascular risk conditions. In conclusion, the combination of ZOFE and NEBI offers a potentially promising therapeutic approach for managing hypertension and protecting vascular health, aiming at improving clinical outcomes for patients with cardiovascular diseases.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Nurses’ family members are at increased risk of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety is one of the most common mental health problems associated with the pandemic and may lead to various physical and psychological complications. Given the limited evidence in Iran and the importance of understanding this issue, this study aimed to assess COVID-19–related anxiety among the family members of nurses working in hospitals in Qazvin City. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted among family members of nurses working in three public hospitals in Qazvin City, Iran (Bou Ali Sina, Velayat, and Shahid Rajaei Hospitals). Participants were adult family members (≥ 18 years) living in the same household as the nurse and willing to participate. Those with a prior diagnosis of severe psychiatric disorders or unwilling to complete the questionnaire were excluded. Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire and the Corona Disease Anxiety Scale (CDAS; range 0–54, with higher scores indicating greater anxiety). Descriptive statistics and multiple regression analyses were used to examine relationships among the study variables. Results The mean age of nurses and their family members was 33.54 ± 6.53 and 49.24 ± 12.38 years, respectively. Most family members (65.7%) had a diploma or lower level of education, and 75.3% were employed. The mean CDAS score among family members was 26.86 ± 19.57, indicating moderate levels of anxiety. Family members of male nurses reported higher anxiety than those of female nurses, and parents of nurses experienced higher anxiety compared to spouses or children. Multiple regression analysis showed that the nurse’s work experience, the family member’s relationship to the nurse, education level, and employment status were significant predictors of anxiety. Together, these variables explained 74% of the variance in anxiety scores. Conclusion Family members of nurses working in COVID-19 wards reported higher anxiety compared to those whose nurses worked in non-COVID wards. These findings underscore the need for targeted mental health interventions—such as psychological counseling, online support services, telemedicine-based programs, and family-centered education—to reduce anxiety and promote well-being among this at-risk population.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Panel surveys of disaster victims are essential for providing disaster management with insights into the status, processes, and causal factors of recovery at the individual level. However, previous research using such survey data has largely overlooked detailed trajectories of survey response and attrition, which affect data quality. This study systematically identified these trajectories and their determinants using panel data from the Great East Japan Earthquake. It specifically examined disaster-related impacts, addressed missing values through multiple imputation, and analyzed three survey processes using a nested logit model (for processes 1 and 2) and a group-based trajectory model (for process 3): (1) the willingness to cooperate in the second wave survey (Wave 2); (2) the actual response in Wave 2; and (3) response and attrition trajectories from Wave 2 onward. The results show that (a) three trajectories—continuous response, sustained attrition, and gradual attrition—were observed in the disaster panel data; (b) resilience-vulnerability and life-recovery attitudes and participation were associated with the first process, while environmental shift was associated with the second process; and (c) in the third process, compared to the continuous response trajectory, sustained attrition was associated with resilience-vulnerability and life-recovery attitudes and participation, while gradual attrition was associated with environmental shift and life-recovery attitudes and participation. These findings suggest that response and attrition trajectories and their determinants are closely related to victims’ life recovery processes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The electroplating industry plays an important role in modern manufacturing, providing corrosion protection, wear resistance, and functional surfaces for applications ranging from automotive to electronics. However, its reliance on heavy metals and hazardous electrolytes generates significant environmental impacts, particularly through wastewater discharges laden with toxic ions. Addressing these dual challenges of corrosion protection and wastewater management requires the development of sustainable and scalable innovations. Electrochemical science offers a versatile platform to tackle both, enabling the development of advanced coatings and environmentally responsible treatment technologies. Recent advances in anticorrosive strategies include nanostructured and hybrid coatings with tailored functionality, improved adhesion, and self-healing capabilities. In parallel, electrochemical approaches for wastewater remediation, such as electrodeposition, provide pathways to remove and recover critical metals, supporting resource efficiency and circular economy principles. Emerging trends highlight the integration of hybrid systems that combine electrochemical processes with adsorption, membranes, or bioelectrochemical modules, thereby enhancing selectivity and scalability. Sustainability considerations are increasingly shaping research agendas, with green solvents, bio-based inhibitors, and energy-efficient electrochemical reactors being actively investigated. At the same time, techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment are essential to bridge laboratory innovation and industrial adoption. Looking ahead, frontier opportunities lie in multifunctional coatings, resource recovery platforms, and the integration of artificial intelligence for process optimization. This perspective underscores the transformative potential of electrochemical strategies at the intersection of materials development, wastewater treatment, and critical resource recovery, pointing toward a future where industrial performance and environmental stewardship converge.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Monitoring the structural integrity of laminated composite materials, such as those used in aerospace structures, presents significant challenges due to the complexity of failure mechanisms like delaminations, which are often invisible on the surface. This study proposes an innovative methodology for identifying multiple delaminations using a combination of optimization techniques and artificial intelligence, addressing a highly complex problem in both fields. The Sunflower Optimization Algorithm (SFO) was explored to solve the inverse problem, while Machine Learning (ML) models and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were employed for classifying the number of delaminations and regressing their parameters. The damages were parameterized as ellipses in a square composite laminate plate modeled using finite elements. Strain data, obtained from the forward problem, were used to evaluate the performance of the SFO, which demonstrated high efficiency in converging on cases with 1 and 2 induced damages in the plate. Additionally, a new strain data dataset was developed for training and testing ML and ANN models to assess the efficiency of regression techniques. The results showed that both classification and regression performed at a high level, with approximately 100% accuracy in classifying the different quantities of damages. In the regression of a single damage, an average $$R^2$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:msup> <mml:mi>R</mml:mi> <mml:mn>2</mml:mn> </mml:msup> </mml:math> of 99% was achieved for position parameters and 49% for its size. However, for multiple damages, especially in cases with 3 damages for SFO and 2 and 3 damages for ML models, the regression of parameters proved challenging, reflecting the inherent complexity of the problem addressed. This work also proposes a new dataset as a resource for future evaluations of regression efficiency, contributing to advancements in the field of structural integrity monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract PM 2.5 is an important component of haze, and an in-depth understanding of PM 2.5 pollution characteristics and potential source areas is of great significance for the accurate prevention and control of PM 2.5 pollution. Previous studies have mostly focused on heavy pollution periods or economically developed areas and neglecting the seasonal and regional characteristics of urban PM 2.5 pollution in mountainous areas. Based on meteorological data and PM 2.5 concentration data, this study analyses the characteristics of PM 2.5 pollution in Linyi in different seasons and explores the regional sources of PM 2.5 . Cluster analysis using Euclidean distance was employed to detect the principal pathways for PM 2.5 transport. To identify the most critical sources of PM 2.5 , both the WPSCF and WCWT methods were employed. The findings indicated a discernible improvement in PM 2.5 contamination levels in Linyi in recent years. Linyi’s main sources of PM 2.5 originates primarily from neighboring areas, including eastern Henan, northern Anhui and northern Shandong. Seasonal variations exist in the possible source regions contributing to the PM 2.5 concentrations in Linyi. During spring and winter, there exists a multitude of potential source areas that substantially influence the concentrations of PM 2.5 . On the contrary, the number of potential source areas is restricted and their contribution to PM 2.5 concentrations is relatively low in summer and autumn. The study will provide a scientific basis for preventing and controlling PM 2.5 pollution in mountainous city. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases remains poorly understood, largely because existing models fail to capture both the initial triggers and the full spectrum of systemic manifestations. Here, we identify the skin epithelium as an initiating site of autoimmune activation. Specifically, we found that PPARγ levels are broadly reduced in basal-layer keratinocytes from patients across the lupus disease spectrum. To investigate the functional impact of this epithelial defect, we employed keratinocyte-specific gene editing in mice. Localized editing induced cutaneous lupus-like inflammation, while more extensive epithelial perturbation triggered rapid systemic autoimmunity, characterized by multi-organ inflammation and autoantibody production. Moreover, ultraviolet exposure accelerated the progression from cutaneous to systemic disease, recapitulating the spectrum transition and clinical photosensitivity. Mechanistically, we found that proinflammatory keratinocytes promoted the emergence of migratory CCR7⁺ dendritic cells, which appeared to initiate and amplify immune activation beyond the epithelial niche. Our findings establish the skin epithelium as a critical initiator of autoimmunity and provide a tunable model that recapitulates key features of human lupus spectrum.",

    "Abstract": "This article investigates conditions under which just transition (JT) – a union concept reconciling worker protection with environmental imperatives – becomes entangled in the dynamics of climate delay within North Sea energy politics. Drawing on interviews with trade union representatives and environmental actors in Norway and the UK, we examine how unions navigate energy transitions through strategies that both reinforce and challenge climate delay. Our analysis reveals a critical paradox: both institutionalised inclusion (Norway) and exclusion (UK) lead to delay through different mechanisms. Norwegian unions, embedded within corporatist arrangements, maintain consensus against timetabled phaseout through strategic avoidance. UK exclusion produces fragmented union strategies and undermines implementation and trust. Yet neither outcome is fixed: UK fragmentation creates insurgent potential; Norwegian consensus masks emerging divisions. These dynamics – shaped by historical experiences, structural positioning and institutional constraints – underscore unions' contradictory capacity to either reproduce fossil capital relations or challenge them through coordinated labour strategies and cross-movement coalitions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Maintenance procedures are critically important for preserving the structural integrity, maintaining the functionality and ensuring the operational safety of aircraft. Traditional inspection techniques used in aircraft are often costly, time-consuming and prone to human mistake. Today, the opportunities provided by digitalisation and automation in aircraft maintenance and inspection processes are paving the way for innovative approaches. In this context, the use of inspection systems supported by image processing technologies has the potential to bring about a significant transformation in aircraft maintenance. Visual inspection methods integrated with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) enable the rapid, accurate and repeatable detection of defects such as corrosion and cracks on the external surfaces of aircraft. This study focuses on the automatic detection and classification of defects on the external surfaces of aircraft, based on tests and analyses carried out by artificial intelligence algorithms using high-resolution data. The model developed in this study was implemented in Python in the Google Colab environment and supported by AI algorithms trained on visual data. The main objective is to investigate the feasibility of UAV-based systems for aircraft visual inspection and to provide concrete evidence of their practical applicability. In this regard, the UAV platform selected for image acquisition is intended to comprehensively scan the target areas and capture images with sufficient resolution for processing by artificial intelligence algorithms. A review of the literature reveals that UAV- and AI-based integrated approaches have been explored in only a limited number of studies related to aircraft maintenance. In this context, the present study proposes a system that enables the rapid and accurate detection of structural defects such as corrosion and cracks on the external surfaces of aircraft.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract On June 19, 2024, the Anti-Money Laundering Regulation (“AMLR”), the Regulation establishing the Anti-Money Laundering Authority (“AMLAR”), and the Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (“AMLD6”) were published in the Official Journal of the EU, signaling a significant shift in the institutional and substantive architecture of anti-money laundering (“AML”) frameworks within the Union. More than simply enhancing existing rules, the new regime introduces innovative solutions to address persistent deficiencies in previous AML/CFT frameworks, particularly the fragmentation across Member States. A notable innovation is the extension of the AML regulatory framework to the professional football sector, which has become increasingly vulnerable to illicit financial activity due to its complex organisation, large financial flows and opaque ownership structures. As a result, professional football clubs and football agents are now subject to AML requirements, including customer due diligence, transaction monitoring and reporting suspicious transactions. This article examines the recently introduced AML obligations for the football sector, navigating the complex regulatory framework and mapping out the underlying requirements. The aim is to increase awareness and understanding of these obligations, thereby aiding football clubs and agents in complying with them and ensuring the integrity of the European football industry.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract How do institutionalized memories of historical trauma shape contemporary political attitudes? This study examines how emotionally evocative reminders of past violence influence public opinion. Drawing on a survey experiment in South Korea, I test how symbolic narratives of Japanese colonial repression affect emotional responses and downstream political views. The results show that while these reminders evoke strong emotions—especially anger and fear—they do not directly alter attitudes toward national identity or policy. Instead, anger, more than fear, consistently predicts both inclusive orientations, such as increased national pride, and exclusive preferences, including support for protectionist policies. These findings suggest that historical trauma influences political behavior not by providing new information but by activating internalized emotional frameworks. The study contributes to research on the legacy of political violence by identifying discrete emotions as key mechanisms linking collective victimhood to divergent political responses.",

    "Abstract": "The present study experimentally investigates the onset of ventilation of surface-piercing hydrofoils. Under steady-state conditions, the depth-based Froude number $\\textit{Fr}$ and the angle of attack $\\alpha$ define regions in which distinct flow regimes are either locally or globally stable. To map the boundary between these stability regions, the parameter space $(\\alpha , \\textit{Fr})$ was systematically surveyed by increasing $\\alpha$ until the onset of ventilation while maintaining a constant $\\textit{Fr}$ . Two simplified model hydrofoils were examined: a semi-ogive with a blunt trailing edge and a modified NACA 0010-34. Tests were conducted in a towing tank under quasi-steady-state conditions for aspect ratios of $1.0$ and $1.5$ , and for $\\textit{Fr}$ ranging from $0.5$ to $2.5$ . Ventilation occurred spontaneously for all test conditions as $\\alpha$ increased. Three distinct trigger mechanisms were identified: nose, tail and base ventilation. Nose ventilation is prevalent at $\\textit{Fr} \\lt 1.0$ and $\\textit{Fr} \\lt 1.25$ for aspect ratios of $1.0$ and $1.5$ , respectively, and is associated with an increase in the inception angle of attack. Tail ventilation becomes prevalent at higher $\\textit{Fr}$ , and the inception angle of attack exhibits a negative trend. Base ventilation was only observed for the semi-ogive profile, but it did not lead to the development of a stable ventilated cavity. Notably, the measurements indicate that the boundary between bistable and globally stable regions is not uniform and extends to significantly higher $\\alpha$ than previously estimated. A revised stability map is proposed to reconcile previously published and current data, demonstrating how two alternative paths to a steady-state condition can lead to different flow regimes.",

    "Abstract": "Torque-driven steering of magnetic micro/nanobots in fluids is one of the most promising platforms of controlled propulsion at the small scales, and it has been the focus of modern biomedical applications. The propulsion is a result of rotation–translation coupling and it requires non-trivial (e.g. chiral) geometry of the nanobot and the weak (millitesla) rotating magnetic field. At submicron scale, nanobots are subjected to intrinsic thermal fluctuations that may become comparable to the magnetic driving. We investigate the effect of Brownian fluctuations on the actuation and steering of magnetized nanohelices in a viscous fluid numerically, using Langevin simulations. First, we assume force-free propulsion and study the effect of thermal fluctuations on driven rotation and steering of the nanohelix. We demonstrate that the random Brownian torque dramatically impedes the nanobot’s propulsion via (i) hindering the rate of the forced rotation; (ii) altering its orientation, i.e. increasing the precession angle of the forced rotations. We further demonstrate that even for fairly low thermal noise (rotational Péclet number, $ \\textit{Pe} \\approx 10$ ), the angular velocity of the forced rotation drops by $2$ – $3$ times, while the precession angle increases two fold as compared with the non-Brownian limit. Both these factors contribute to an approximately $2.5$ -fold reduction of the propulsion velocity. Furthermore, when the magnitude of thermal fluctuations is comparable to magnetic driving ( $ \\textit{Pe} \\approx 1$ ), we find an order-of-magnitude reduction of the propulsion speed. Although inclusion of a stochastic thermal force does not alter the propulsion velocity on average, it considerably increases its variance and further impedes the propeller’s steerability.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract It has already been three years since millions of Ukrainians found refuge in other countries. In our longitudinal research, we examine in what way the main news websites in Poland and Czechia portray Ukrainian refugees and through that how they contribute to their social construction as a group deserving or undeserving of societal and public policy support. Data were collected from platform X, focusing on the accounts of the five most popular news websites in each country. In 2022, we expanded CARIN to CARIN+A, highlighting assistance as a booster (Zogata-Kusz, Öbrink Hobzová, and Cekiera, 2023). Now, examining the period between February 24, 2023, and July 31, 2024, we formulate a hypothesis of dimension content modification , i.e. the meaning of deservingness dimensions change over time for the same target group. Both countries exhibited similar themes and narratives. This was most visible in the attitude and reciprocity , although identity was also important. While at the beginning of the invasion the question of deservingness tied to who they are , later how they behave became crucial. Additionally, we observed normalisation of the situation, without compassion fatigue. Longitudinal media analysis is rare but crucial for countering xenophobia and nationalism.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Scholars are increasingly interrogating distinctions between ‘war time’ and ‘peace time’, but what happens when time itself becomes a weapon of war or, even, a model of conflict response. Focusing on the case study of the first armed UN mission, the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) to Sinai and the Gaza Strip during the 1956 Suez Crisis, I examine the mission’s attempt to replace the Israeli invasion and establish an open-ended international administration on the Gaza Strip. Using archival documents and photographs, this paper explores how UN operations in Palestine shaped temporal assumptions about the population and the conflict. I argue that the Suez Crisis ruptured an UN-managed temporal paralysis on the Gaza Strip which opened up opportunities for new futures in Gaza, as well as anxiety to return to controlled paralysis. Examining both Palestinian and international reactions to the UN occupation, I show how the ‘Gaza exception’ policy transformed international perceptions of the region – its past, present, and future. Thus, by focusing on the moment of the brief UN occupation, I argue that this international intervention shifted global perceptions of the strip from a ‘frozen’ site of past conflict into a space of unfinished ownership and future potentiality.",

Drawing on survey data on musical preferences (2021) and radio airplays from 2017 to 2022, the study combines big data methodologies with a reflexive theoretical approach about mainstream music as a meta-genre. The findings expose the relational structure of audience taste, revealing genre clusters that reflect cultural divides between global and local, and a dual mainstream formation in the radio’s airplay: one driven by seasonal, high-rotation global hits, and another composed of canonized domestic and regional evergreens. This layered formation illustrates how institutional repetition and audience selection reproduce the status quo in contemporary cultural industries, while constraining aesthetic innovation, marginalizing younger local artists, and reinforcing generational divides within the Slovenian music landscape.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Since 2012, China has steadily advanced its anti-corruption efforts through the dual strategies of “hunting tigers” and “swatting flies.” However, the distinct impact of information about these two approaches on public perceptions of corruption across government levels remains underexplored. Drawing on a randomized survey experiment with 1,596 respondents in H province, this study reveals a phenomenon we term “hierarchical corruption perception.” Our findings indicate that information about grassroots-focused “swatting flies” efforts significantly reduces public perceptions of corruption at lower levels of government while producing mixed effects for perceived corruption at higher levels. In contrast, information about high-profile “hunting tigers” cases has limited average effects but significantly impacts individuals with lower corruption tolerance. By demonstrating that the effects of anti-corruption information depend on both the level of government involved and individual predispositions, these findings challenge conventional views on “corruption scandal fatigue” and provide important insights for designing effective, grassroots-oriented anti-corruption communication strategies.",

The paper delves into these issues by presenting the case study of Agorà Democratiche within the Italian Democratic Party (PD), the major center-left party in Italy. Agorà aimed to engage party members and like-minded citizens in shaping the party’s agenda through deliberative assemblies. This adoption by Agorà introduced a new form of political participation that led thousands of citizens to voice their opinions. However, it encountered several challenges. The paper argues that democratic innovations do not always yield the desired outcomes for political parties. Participatory and deliberative processes might be hard to implement in established political groups that are accustomed to old political schemas. More specifically, I pinpoint four main obstacles encountered by Agorà Democratiche: the ‘culture of verticality’ within the party, an unfavorable external context, the lack of institutionalization of the programme, and the ambiguous role played by technology. If not handled carefully, new technologies and deliberative processes can worsen the existing crisis within political parties by falling short of expectations and further undermining the organization’s credibility.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a dual-band reflectarray antenna based on a 1-bit hybrid active/passive metasurface, achieving independent four-beam radiation at frequencies of 5.8 and 9.7 GHz. The proposed unit cell integrates an active double-split square ring with PIN diodes for 180° phase switching at 5.8 GHz, and a passive cross-shaped patch for 180° phase control at 9.7 GHz. A chessboard-like coding arrangement enables independent beam steering at both frequencies. Experimental results from a fabricated 15 × 15 metasurface prototype show stable four-beam operation, with measured steering angles of 19° and 12.1°, and 3-dB beamwidths of 10.2° and 11.5° at 5.8 and 9.7 GHz, respectively, validating good agreement with simulations. The proposed metasurface demonstrates significant promise for applications in multiband radar and communication systems requiring compact, low-profile, reconfigurable antennas.",

    "Abstract": "Foodborne pathogens present significant public health risks, demanding sensitive on-site detection and effective antibacterial strategies. To address this, we synthesized magnetic-gold plasmonic blackbody (MNP@GPB) nanocomposites by coating a gold/polydopamine hybrid layer onto magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) via in situ redox polymerization. The resulting MNP@GPBs exhibited excellent colloidal stability, broadband absorption, rapid magnetic responsiveness, and efficient photothermal conversion. Leveraging these properties, we engineered multifunctional probes for magnetic enrichment, colorimetric and photothermal signal generation, and antibacterial action in immunochromatographic assays (ICAs) for sensitive detection and simultaneous inactivation of <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>. The limits of detection for MNP@GPB-ICA in the colorimetric and photothermal formats were 1.4 × 10<sup>3</sup> and 3.4 × 10<sup>2</sup> CFU/mL, respectively, representing approximately 8-fold and 32-fold improvements in sensitivity over gold nanoparticle-based-ICA. Notably, near-complete inactivation of residual <i>S. typhimurium</i> on the test line was achieved after near-infrared irradiation, substantially reducing the risk of secondary contamination from discarded strips. MNP@GPBs thus represent a transformative platform unifying diagnostic signaling with antibacterial functionality for food safety monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Mpa is an AAA+ ATPase that unfolds and translocates substrate proteins during proteasomal degradation. Mpa spontaneously assembles into a homohexamer driven by interdomain interactions, even in the absence of a nucleotide. To dissect the mechanisms underlying its oligomerization and deoligomerization, we perturbed the system using chemical and thermal denaturants and monitored the oligomeric states by far-UV CD, fluorescence, calorimetry, state-of-the-art single-particle mass photometry, and ATPase activity assays. Equilibrium chemical denaturation resulted in gradual changes in spectroscopic signals, whereas mass photometry revealed a direct transition from a hexamer to monomeric species, indicating a concerted but noncooperative pathway without any intermediate oligomeric or folded monomeric states. In contrast, thermal perturbation showed two sharp and distinct transitions, the first one corresponding to a concerted and cooperative transition from hexamer to unfolded state, which further aggregates, and the second transition to disaggregation at elevated temperatures. Both chemical and thermal unfolding processes were irreversible with respect to the reassembly of the functional oligomer. Using single-particle mass photometry complemented by spectroscopy and calorimetry, these findings establish that Mpa is an obligate oligomer and can provide insights into the oligomerization pathways of AAA+ enzymes that spontaneously hexamerize and have the potential to further illuminate evolutionary strategies underlying their assembly mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "Aldehyde-based bioconjugation offers attractive alternatives to <i>N</i>-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters for the selective modification of lysine and N-terminal amines, but most existing methods require auxiliary reagents or suffer from poor stability. We introduce 2-(bromoalkyl)benzaldehydes as a versatile class of reagents that react directly with primary amines in aqueous media without catalysts or reducing agents. The imine of the ortho-bromomethylbenzaldehyde undergoes rapid intramolecular cyclization to form isoindoles, enabling tandem coupling to maleimides through a Diels-Alder reaction and thereby labeling of proteins and oligonucleotides, albeit with limited stability in buffer. In contrast, ortho-bromoethyl analogues form stable isoquinolinium intermediates and the reagents exhibit markedly improved aqueous stability compared to NHS esters. Incorporation of alkyne or azide handles further allows CuAAC and SPAAC coupling, including a one-pot copper-free DNA-antibody conjugation. This modular platform enables mild, efficient, and durable labeling of proteins, oligonucleotides, and antibodies, providing a reagent-economical and broadly applicable strategy for bioconjugation in targeted therapeutics, molecular imaging, and nanoscale engineering.",

    "Abstract": "Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are commonly used in disinfecting and personal care products for their antimicrobial, surfactant, and preservative properties. This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of QACs in assisted living facilities through the analysis of 19 QACs from three different QAC subgroups in indoor dust and air samples collected from three assisted living facilities in Indiana, United States (US), as well as in wristbands worn by the residents and staff of these facilities. The medians of the total QAC concentrations (∑QAC, the sum of 19 QAC concentrations) were 151,000 ng/g in dust, 3.17 ng/m<sup>3</sup> in air, and 2,290 ng/g in wristbands. Benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (BACs) were the most abundant QAC group in all three matrices and contributed 58-87% to the ∑QAC concentrations. The QAC distribution patterns found in dust, air, and wristbands were similar to those reported for disinfecting products, suggesting these products could be an important indoor source in assisted living. QAC concentrations in wristbands worn by staff during their work shift were significantly higher than those in wristbands worn by residents (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In addition, the levels found in dust from assisted living were several times higher than those previously reported in US residential households. Concentrations of C12-, C14-, and C16-BACs in dust, air, and wristbands significantly and positively correlated, suggesting common sources in the indoor environment. Estimated daily intake (EDI) of QACs suggests that accidental dust ingestion is the predominant exposure route, accounting for approximately 62% of the total QAC intake. The elevated QAC concentrations in assisted living facilities are of concern for the residents and staff of these facilities because of the potential health risks associated with exposure to these chemicals, such as respiratory effects.",

    "Abstract": "The extensive global use of synthetic polymers has raised concern about their environmental fate, particularly regarding the generation and ecological impact of polymer degradation products. Effective environmental risk assessment requires an understanding of degradation product identity and environmental behavior, yet polymer metabolomics libraries are not well-populated. In this work, mass remainder analysis was used to systematically characterize oligomeric degradation products of polyamide-6 (PA6), polycaprolactone (PCL), and polylactic acid (PLA) using nontarget liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. Distinct homologous series were identified, revealing oligomers of up to seven repeating units for PA6, four for PCL, and 12 for PLA. Among the features detected, up to 70% formed remainder-based clusters (i.e., related by Kendrick mass defects of whole integers and a constant remainder) indicative of plastic-derived oligomerization patterns. To overcome limitations in molecular formula annotations for larger oligomers generated by SIRIUS, this work leveraged retention time variations, MS<sup>2</sup> fragmentation, and spectral matching for reliable characterization and structural elucidation. Retention time changes across varying mobile-phase pHs (2.7, 5.0, and 9.0) revealed substantial shifts for oligomers with ionizable functional groups, allowing quantitative insights into their acid-base properties (p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub>). These experimentally determined hydrophobicity values (i.e., log <i>K</i><sub>ow</sub>) deviated from computational estimations from a suite of available tools across polymer chemistries, highlighting inadequacies in existing estimation models and the opportunity for the rapid measurement of these important physicochemical properties using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry workflows. This work demonstrates the necessity of experimentally derived oligomer-specific data to improve computational modeling for assessing the environmental fate of polymer degradation products.",

    "Abstract": "In collaboration with Vermont state and school officials, we conducted a research study to measure emissions of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from room surfaces in Vermont schools. Our study, the largest of its kind, investigated the sources of airborne PCBs in indoor school environments. Using simultaneous deployment of air samplers and emission samplers, we measured airborne PCBs in 16 schools and 98 school rooms constructed prior to 1980. There was a wide range in PCB air concentrations (1.7-5700 ng m<sup>-3</sup>, <i>n</i> = 159) and surface emissions (33-830,000 ng m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>, <i>n</i> = 182) across different schools as well as between rooms in the same school. We found that emissions of PCB congeners from walls, floors, ceiling and wall expansion joint caulking, and spray insulation explain the airborne PCB congener concentrations in many rooms. Our emission samplers identified three distinct types of building materials with emissions exceeding 30,000 ng m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup> including expansion joint sealant (up to 480,000 ng m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>), glass block windows (up to 30,000 ng m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>), and fireproof coating on steel columns (up to 830,000 ng m<sup>-2</sup> d<sup>-1</sup>). Consequently, school staff have an estimated excess lifetime cancer risk from both dioxin-like and nondioxin-like PCBs that ranges from 1.3 × 10<sup>-8</sup> to 1.7 × 10<sup>-4</sup> for central tendency exposure, and 2.8 × 10<sup>-8</sup> to 3.8 × 10<sup>-4</sup> for reasonable maximum exposure (State of Vermont's target cancer risk = 1 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). Although production has been banned for decades, our study illustrates that PCBs continue to pose an exposure risk to occupants due to their long history of use in building materials. Our findings underscore the risks associated with the historic presence of PCB-containing building materials, offering critical insights for community efforts aimed at reducing exposure among children and school staff in thousands of schools across the country.",

    "Abstract": "Multiple studies demonstrate mixture effects arising from the interactive toxicity of environmental chemicals in human blood, but identifying the main toxic drivers remains challenging. In a recent proof-of-principle <i>in vitro</i> study, we showed that personalized mixtures (PMs), reconstructed from 24 persistent organic pollutant (POPs) concentrations measured in individual blood samples from Swedish adults, induced unique interindividual effects on H295R cell viability and steroidogenesis. Here, we followed up by testing submixtures of four PMs (PM#3, PM#4, PC1-OC-Mix, and PC2-PFAS-Mix), separated by the chemical classes perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Submixtures of PFAS and OCPs induced significant effects on testosterone synthesis at low (1×) and medium (10×) concentrations, consistent with effects observed in the corresponding whole PMs, and were therefore likely the primary drivers of the whole-mixture effects on testosterone. Notably, some submixtures altered estradiol and testosterone levels in ways not observed in full PMs, suggesting antagonistic interactions across chemical classes when combined. Potential antagonistic interaction in more complex mixtures, independent of concentration, was also observed within OCP submixtures, as only the less complex OCP mixtures lacking DDE or DDT induced testosterone synthesis. For additional mechanistic insight, we expanded the H295R assay to include oxidative stress analyses, which revealed no effects from the PMs. RT-qPCR analysis showed downregulation of <i>CYP11A1</i> after exposure to PM#3 and PM#4 at high concentrations (100×), suggesting a feedback mechanism contributing to suppressed testosterone synthesis.",

    "Abstract": "The growing concern about water pollution has intensified the demand for rapid and sensitive pollutant monitoring. Electroactive biosensors (e-biosensors) hold significant potential in detecting toxic pollutants through bioelectrical signal responses but are constrained by inefficient electron and mass transport within conventional biofilm-based architectures. Here, we address both limitations by developing a 3D-engineered e-biosensor with a synergistically optimized material composition and geometric architecture. A novel electroactive living material was fabricated by incorporating Ca<sup>2</sup><sup>+</sup>-doped PEDOT:PSS to enhance microbial extracellular electron transport. The living material was then engineered into a grid-structure e-biosensor by extrusion-based 3D bioprinting, significantly improving analyte mass transport to the sensing cells. This dual optimization resulted in the 3D-engineered e-biosensor exhibiting a 6.3-fold increase in baseline current, a 1.9-fold improvement in signal-to-noise ratio, and an extended operational stability (>140 h) relative to conventional biofilm-based counterparts. Moreover, the 3D-engineered e-biosensors demonstrated a rapid response (<20 min) to various toxic pollutants, including Cr(VI) and nitrobenzene. Additionally, we constructed a portable device integrating the 3D-engineered e-biosensors and successfully validated its effectiveness and reproducibility for pollution monitoring in real waters. This work establishes a new paradigm for e-biosensor engineering by integrating materials science and digital biomanufacturing, offering an innovative solution for water pollution monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "Rare earth elements (REEs) are crucial components in a wide range of modern technologies, from renewable energy systems to advanced electronics and defense applications. Due to their growing global demand and limited primary sources, there is an urgent need to explore alternative sources for REEs recovery. Oil sand tailings, a major byproduct of bitumen extraction processes, represent an underexplored source of REEs and other valuable metals. In this study, we investigated the mineralogical and biogeochemical characteristics of three distinct oil sands tailing streams to assess their potential as a secondary source of REEs and to better understand their speciation and distribution mechanisms. Chemical analyses of these tailings indicated elevated concentrations of several metals, such as aluminum (≈94,490 mg/kg), titanium (≈10,210 mg/kg), magnesium (≈5891 mg/kg), and manganese (≈1060 mg/kg). REEs concentrations ranged from 442.72 to 797.79 mg/kg, highlighting the tailings' potential for resource recovery. The extraction of REEs from such waste streams aligns with the \"waste-to-resource\" concept, offering an environmentally sustainable route to strategic material supply diversification. This study provides critical insights into the complex interplay among mineralogy, geochemistry, and microbiology of REEs and other valuable elements in oil sands tailings. By assessing the mechanisms of metal association and mobilization, our findings aim to contribute to the development of targeted extraction strategies and support the broader goal of sustainable resource recovery from industrial waste streams.",

    "Abstract": "Research on iron (Fe)-mediated plant mitigation of cadmium (Cd) stress has achieved significant progress. This review elucidates the dual role of Fe as both a \"shield and spear\" from a Spatial perspective. Initially, exogenous Fe acts as a rapid \"shield\" by immobilizing Cd, recruiting beneficial microorganisms, and forming iron plaque in the rhizosphere to inhibit Cd uptake, simultaneously initiating early defense by upregulating Fe uptake systems. Subsequently, Fe shifts to a \"spear\" function, enhancing long-term plant tolerance by inhibiting Cd transport at cellular levels, repairing photosystem damage, and strengthening antioxidant defenses at molecular levels. These mechanisms provide crucial insights for developing Fe-based agronomic strategies. However, the dose-response toxicity and the trade-off between defense and growth limit field practical application. To address this, we integrate the physicochemical properties of Fe-based materials with agronomic management practices to propose application guidelines, advancing sustainable agricultural development.",

From about 1000 homologous sequences screened via protein BLAST and deep learning-based kcat prediction, the glycosyltransferase MiCGT from <i>Mangifera indica</i> was selected for rational design. After molecular docking and phylogenetic analysis, the engineered variant PCAA (MiCGT<sup>S121P/M148C/K253A/S281A</sup>) exhibited a 103-fold higher activity than wild-type MiCGT. To enable cost-effective production, sucrose synthase GmSUS was coupled with PCAA to regenerate UDP-glucose during quercetin glycosylation, yielding 3.91 mM isoquercetin with a 78.1% conversion rate.

    "Abstract": "Metabolic pathway design is a fundamental aspect of metabolic engineering, playing a crucial role in the microbial synthesis of high-value compounds. While metabolic engineers recognize the prevalence of branching reactions─side reactions that divert metabolic flux toward nontarget compounds─current automated pathway design tools often focus primarily on linear pathway optimization. This focus may lead to incomplete efficiency assessments and suboptimal pathway selection due to unaccounted metabolic complexity. To address this gap, we introduce a novel metabolic pathway design method, EA-MNE (Evolutionary Algorithm-based Metabolic Network Evaluation). Within the EA-MNE method, we propose a new approach for expanding linear pathways into metabolic networks and two new evaluation criteria: (1) the number of effective branching reactions, which assesses the extent of branching impacts, and (2) the network theoretical yield, which precisely quantifies yield losses caused by branching reactions. Additionally, we integrate four key criteria─the number of effective branching reactions, network theoretical yield, network toxicity, and Gibbs free energy─for metabolic pathway design. This integrated approach provides a systematic solution for addressing branching reaction challenges, significantly improving both the accuracy of pathway evaluation and the synthetic efficiency of microbial systems.",

Marcus theory overwhelmingly agrees with experiment─both in terms of electron transfer and triplet energy transfer─for the famous set of naphthalene-bridge-biphenyl and naphthalene-bridge-benzophenone systems studied by Piotrowiak, Miller, and Closs. That being said, the agreement is not perfect, and in this manuscript, we revisit one key point of disagreement: the molecule C-13-ae ([3,equatorial]-naphthalene-cyclohexane-[1,axial]-benzophenone). To better understand the theory-experiment disagreement, we introduce and employ a novel scheme to sample the seam between two diabatic electronic states (E-SHAKE) through which we reveal the breakdown of the Condon approximation and the presence of a conical intersection for the C-13-ae molecule; we also predict an isotopic effect on the rate of triplet-triplet energy transfer.",

The detailed quantum spin structure of reactive ligands of these clusters can be studied experimentally and theoretically by means of magnetic hyperfine spectroscopy, which can reveal catalytic intermediates in these biochemical processes. Their theoretical prediction, however, requires either advanced methods that describe strongly correlated systems or Hamiltonian modeling based on symmetry-broken electronic structure methods. This work shows that the addition of electron-transfer interactions to the Heisenberg-Dirac-Van Vleck Hamiltonian model leads to a quantitative explanation of hyperfine coupling constants at active organic ligand sites. Comparison with experimentally available results confirms that our extended approach can be used in calculations aimed at describing cutting-edge systems.",

To comprehend <i>Fusarium</i>-responsive multihost pathogenicity, we temporally profiled cross-kingdom species, chickpea and worm using SWATH-mass spectrometry. Morphological analyses revealed that increased wilting and intestinal disintegration elicits a disease response in chickpea and worm. Peptide-spectrum library consisted of 5629 and 3138 proteins from <i>Fusarium</i> infected chickpea and worm, respectively.

    "Abstract": "Achieving reliable hydrogen sensing at room temperature remains a critical challenge due to the limited carrier transport and unstable surface chemistry of conventional polycrystalline oxides. Here, we demonstrate that precise growth-mode control of epitaxial anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> thin films via sputtering atmosphere engineering provides an effective route to overcoming these limitations. By systematically tuning the Ar/O<sub>2</sub> ratio, the TiO<sub>2</sub> growth mode transitions from a defective island-like mode to a layer-by-layer mode and finally to a stress-induced island. The film deposited at an 8/1 Ar/O<sub>2</sub> ratio achieves an ideal combination of perfect crystallinity, an atomically flat surface, and a balanced oxygen vacancy concentration, yielding a clean and well-defined Pd-TiO<sub>2</sub> interface upon catalyst deposition. The resulting Pd/TiO<sub>2</sub> sensor exhibits exceptional room-temperature hydrogen sensing performance: a strong response of 11.34 to 100 ppm of H<sub>2</sub>, a low detection limit (5 ppm), excellent selectivity over other battery abuse gases, remarkable humidity resistance, and long-term stability. Comprehensive structural and mechanistic analyses reveal that the superior performance originates from an efficient interface-dominated sensing mechanism, rather than the conventional surface reaction pathway. This work establishes a \"structure over stoichiometry\" paradigm for developing advanced gas sensors and provides an effective route toward high-reliability, low-power hydrogen safety monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "Rising numbers of organ failures have intensified the demand for high-performance biomaterials to support the development of bioartificial organs and advanced bioreactors. Hollow fiber membranes (HFMs) are particularly well-suited for such applications, including bioartificial kidney, liver, and 3D cell culture systems, due to their unique architecture and functional versatility. In this study, we engineered HFMs by blending amphiphilic Pluronic F127 (PF127) with poly(ether sulfone) (PES), aiming to enhance both separation efficiency and cellular attachment and proliferation. Physicochemical characterization revealed that PF127 incorporation resulted in a concentric, porous membrane structure with significantly improved porosity as compared to that of plain PES HFMs. Biocompatibility was assessed using human embryonic kidney (HEK293) and hepatocellular carcinoma liver (HepG2) cell lines. Confocal microscopy, MTT cell viability assays, flow-cytometry-based live/dead assays, and calcein AM/propidium iodide staining demonstrated that PF127/PES HFMs strongly support the attachment and proliferation of viable cells. The attached cells exhibited high metabolic activity and formed three-dimensional spheroids, indicating the bioactive influence of PF127. Hemocompatibility evaluation by hemolysis and terminal complement complex (SC5b9) showed that the HFMs fabricated were hemocompatible, suggesting a diminished inflammatory response. Additionally, separation performance evaluation demonstrated a high ultrafiltration coefficient, highest for 2.5 PF127 (173.83 ± 7.31 mL m<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup> mmHg<sup>-1</sup>) and efficient removal of a broad range of uremic toxins, including urea, creatinine, macroglobulin analogs, and protein-bound toxins such as indoxyl sulfate. Collectively, the enhanced cytocompatibility with kidney and liver cells, hemocompatibility, and separation capability of PF127/PES HFMs make them promising scaffolds for bioartificial kidney and liver applications.",

    "Abstract": "Electron beam lithography (EBL) of chemically amplified resists (CARs) faces fundamental challenges, including stochastic electron scattering and acid diffusion, that limit resolution and reproducibility. Using SU-8 as a model CAR, this study systematically investigated complementary strategies to address these challenges, combining multipass exposure, proximity effect correction (PEC) with midrange correction factors, base quencher incorporation, and post-exposure bake (PEB) suppression. Monte Carlo simulations and calibrated PEC modeling revealed that extending the point spread function to include a midrange scattering component significantly improved critical dimension (CD) control across varying pattern densities, correcting deviations that conventional two-term PEC failed to capture. Multipass exposure, particularly 4-pass writing with a 25% offset, redistributed the dose to average stochastic beam and scattering fluctuations, reducing line-width roughness by more than 50% and yielding more uniform nanoscale features. Photoacid confinement was investigated by adding urea as a base quencher, which successfully reduced acid diffusion but introduced substantial sensitivity penalties without improving ultimate resolution or Z-factor performance, underscoring the trade-offs of chemical versus physical confinement. Suppressing PEB most directly minimized acid diffusion, resulting in improved Z-factors and reproducible 30 nm half-pitch dense line/space patterns. Overall, these results demonstrated that PEC with midrange correction, multipass strategies, quencher additives, and PEB-free processing addresses different aspects of the EBL process window and that their integration provides a comprehensive framework for managing stochastic scattering, diffusion, and chemical amplification effects. This framework advances dense nanoscale patterning in CARs and establishes guiding principles for optimizing resist design and process strategies in high-resolution EBL and potentially other advanced lithographies, such as extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography.",

    "Abstract": "Hybrid electrolyte solutions composed of water and water-miscible organic solvents have gained attention for their extended electrochemical stability window, nonflammability, high ionic conductivity, and cost-effectiveness. Among them, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a particularly attractive cosolvent due to its high dielectric constant, strong hydrogen-bonding ability, low volatility, and excellent chemical stability. When mixed with water, DMSO disrupts the native hydrogen-bond network, significantly altering key physicochemical properties such as viscosity, density, dielectric constant, and water activity─all of which are highly sensitive to composition. Despite their potential, the behavior of water-DMSO electrolytes under high salt concentrations and their effects on electrode performance remain underexplored. Here, we investigated nearly saturated LiClO<sub>4</sub> solutions in water-DMSO mixtures, combining electrochemical testing with NMR, Raman spectroscopies, and theoretical modeling to reveal solvation structures and ion-solvent interactions. We further evaluated how these electrolyte solution compositions impact the electrochemical performance of LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> cathodes and TiO<sub>2</sub> anodes. These insights highlight the promise of DMSO-based hybrid electrolyte solutions for advancing safe and high-performance aqueous lithium battery technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Implantation of intracortical microelectrodes generates free iron species that exacerbate pro-inflammatory responses by producing reactive oxygen species through the Fenton reaction. This work reports a covalently grafted, two-layer poly(ethylene glycol)dimethacrylate (PEGDMA) hydrogel on polyimide-insulated Pt/Ir microwires for local delivery of the iron chelator deferasirox (DFO). The polyimide insulating layer was methacrylated to enable covalent anchoring of a PEGDMA550 interlayer, followed by a DFO-loaded PEGDMA3400 outer layer. Scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy of the hydrogel-coated microwires revealed a uniform coating morphology with dispersed DFO aggregates embedded within the matrix. In buffer at 37 °C, DFO release followed diffusion-controlled kinetics and fell below the limit of detection by ultraperformance liquid chromatography by day 9. The iron-chelation properties of the DFO-loaded microwires were investigated using Fe(EDTA) as a free-iron mimic. When a high concentration of Fe(EDTA) was used (10 mM), the Fe(DFO)<sub>2</sub> complex remained detectable for up to 19 days, which expands well beyond the detection limit of DFO under iron-free conditions (9 days). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy showed time-dependent iron accumulation within the hydrogel, consistent with in-matrix complexation that perturbs local transport and prolongs chelation efficacy. Collectively, the coating functions as a mechanically integrated, responsive reservoir whose pharmacokinetics are governed by the iron concentration rather than initial drug loading. By coupling chelation capacity to local iron availability, the presented hydrogel coating establishes a generalizable route to extend therapeutic lifetimes of functionalized chronic neural electrodes.",

MXene nanosheets were assembled via the layer-by-layer technique into a transparent multilayer (<i>n</i>MXene, <i>n</i> is the number of MXene layers assembled) with photothermal conversion ability, onto which a cross-linked PDMS containing silicone oil (SO) was deposited, forming a composite coating with a PDMS slippery liquid-infused porous surface (SLIPS) and an <i>n</i>MXene photothermal underlayer, and the effects of <i>n</i> and the thickness of the PDMS-SO on the coating properties were studied. It was found that the 3MXene-PDMS-SO coating of 200 μm thickness exhibited a transmittance of 80% at 550 nm wavelength, and in a cold environment of -20 °C, the coating was able to increase the surface temperature by 7.4 °C under 1 sun illumination, significantly delaying ice formation and reducing the ice adhesion strength (τ<sub>ice</sub>) on the surface.

    "Abstract": "Electronic devices operating in extreme cold environments, such as outdoor base stations and polar unmanned aerial vehicles, require not only electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding but also effective anti-icing and deicing capabilities to prevent ice formation and accretion. Protective materials that integrate anti-icing/deicing and EMI shielding functions are critically in demand. The multifunctional superhydrophobic Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub><i>x</i></sub> MXene/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thin film presented herein accomplishes this goal through rational material selection and structural design. A continuous MXene-flakes-constructed conductive network is embedded with radially diameter-arranged PMMA microspheres driven by electrostatic force. Tightly packed nanospheres generate abundant hierarchical wrinkles on the surface, establishing the structural foundation for light absorptivity (89.56%) and hydrophobicity, which reaches a water contact angle of 155.6° after further hydrophobic modification. The existence of PMMA also prevents supercooled droplet penetration into the composite structure under high-humidity environments and prolongs icing time by retarding heat transfer simultaneously. Due to the excellent photothermal and electrothermal properties of MXene, the film surface can remain ice-free for extended periods (>1000 s) under low-temperature and high-humidity conditions with minimal external energy input, while also enabling rapid removal of any accumulated ice. The film remains superior EMI shielding performance, showing an EMI SE of 54.2 dB at 35 ± 7 μm thickness at X-band. This work supplies a promising approach for efficiently integrating anti/deicing and EMI shielding functions.",

    "Abstract": "Nonaqueous lithium-carbon dioxide (Li-CO<sub>2</sub>) batteries exhibit great potential for energy storage but are limited by inherently low rate capability due to sluggish CO<sub>2</sub> reduction kinetics arising from insufficient three-phase interfaces and product passivation layers at the electrode-electrolyte boundary. Aqueous Li-CO<sub>2</sub> systems, leveraging gas-liquid-solid three-phase interfaces for enhanced mass transfer, offer a promising solution to mitigate kinetic bottlenecks and improve rate performance. However, the impact of the electrolyte concentration on reaction selectivity and rate-dependent behavior in such systems remains unexplored. Herein, we systematically investigate the effect of lithium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)azanide (LiTFSI) concentration (1-21 M) on the solvation structure and electrochemical performance during the discharge process. The solvation environment is revealed to transition from a free water-dominated salt-in-water structure at low concentrations to a compact ionic cluster water-in-salt structure at high concentrations. At low salt concentrations, disordered three-dimensional deposition of CO<sub>2</sub> reduction products and significant side reactions such as hydrogen evolution result in low electron utilization (∼15%). In contrast, the 21 M electrolyte induces the formation of a dense 2D product layer, enhancing the CO<sub>2</sub> reduction efficiency while effectively suppressing parasitic reactions. This concentration-dependent modulation of the solvation microenvironment reduces interfacial impedance, limits free water activity, and improves Li<sup>+</sup> transport kinetics, thereby shifting the reaction pathway from side-reaction-dominated to highly selective CO<sub>2</sub> conversion. This work highlights electrolyte concentration as a critical knob to optimize three-phase interface dynamics, offering mechanistic insights to overcome rate-limiting barriers in both aqueous and nonaqueous Li-CO<sub>2</sub> batteries.",

    "Abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) presents formidable challenges due to its aggressive progression and resistance to conventional therapies. Recent advancements in multimodal strategies, such as combining gene therapy with mild-temperature photothermal therapy (mPTT), referred to as GT-mPTT, have shown promise in enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing side effects. However, current systems face limitations in therapeutic response, efficiency, and biosafety. Herein, we report a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive polymeric amphiphile for imaging-guided combinational GT-mPTT therapy, achieving a high-efficiency antitumor performance against OS. This polymer incorporates guanidine-functionalized units for effective gene condensation and near-infrared II (NIR-II) active dyes for efficient photothermal conversion. The system exhibits charge reversal under elevated intratumoral ROS levels, promoting gene release, and achieves controlled mild hyperthermia under NIR-II irradiation, enhancing cellular uptake and enabling effective mPTT. The GT-mPTT combination therapy, guided by dual NIR-II fluorescence and photothermal imaging, demonstrated significant therapeutic outcomes in vitro and in vivo. These include pronounced tumor cell apoptosis, substantial tumor size reduction, and mitigation of osteolysis in OS-bearing mouse models, all while maintaining excellent biosafety and negligible systemic toxicity. This work shows the potential of responsive polymeric platforms with integrated multimodal therapeutic and imaging capabilities as a robust foundation for advancing precision therapies against OS.",

    "Abstract": "CuInS<sub>2</sub> quantum dots (CIS QDs), with tunable photoluminescence spanning from the visible to near-infrared (NIR) region, hold significant potential for consumer electronics and bioimaging due to their favorable photophysical properties and absence of toxic elements. However, their intrinsic lack of short-wavelength emission has hindered their use in white light-emitting applications. Herein, we report a facile synthesis of zinc-acetate-oleylamine (Zn-Ac-OAm) and oleylamine (OAm)-coencapsulated CIS/ZnS QDs that deliver full-spectrum sunlight-like emissions, characterized by a distinct 455 nm peak and an ultrabroad full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 241 nm. The Zn-Ac-OAm emitter produces blue-green fluorescence, effectively compensating for the short-wavelength deficiency of the CIS/ZnS QDs. More importantly, strong interactions between Zn-Ac-OAm and CIS/ZnS QDs enable efficient energy transfer within coencapsulated structures. As a proof of concept, white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) fabricated using these coencapsulated CIS/ZnS QDs exhibit excellent photophysical performance, achieving a high color rendering index (CRI) of 92.1 and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 7.2%. This coencapsulation strategy, together with the elucidated photophysical mechanisms, provides viable pathways for extending the application of long-wavelength-emitting nanomaterials in next-generation lighting and display technologies.",

    "Abstract": "The yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ)-based mixed potential gas sensor represents a promising platform for portable acetone detection systems, owing to their high sensitivity and selectivity. However, the practical deployment of these systems is hindered by sensor output drift, circuit noise, and signal fluctuations caused by variations in operating temperature and ambient humidity. To address these challenges, we developed GT-KANet, a novel hybrid deep-learning algorithm designed for robust temperature-humidity compensation and accurate acetone concentration prediction. The GT-KANet architecture integrates Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks for initial temporal feature extraction, transformer layers enhanced with ContraNorm to mitigate oversmoothing during deep feature learning, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) module for final concentration prediction. Trained on a comprehensive dataset acquired from our independently developed YSZ sensor under controlled conditions, the proposed GT-KANet achieved exceptional predictive accuracy (RMSE = 0.0920 ppm, MAE = 0.0542 ppm) across varying operating temperatures, ambient humidity, and gas concentrations, demonstrating excellent stability and adaptability. Furthermore, by leveraging knowledge distillation, we achieved a 55% reduction in the model's parameter size while maintaining exceptional prediction accuracy, significantly enhancing its feasibility for deployment on resource-constrained embedded platforms. A detailed comparative analysis during development systematically validated the efficacy of each module in boosting prediction accuracy. This work offers a competitive approach for temperature and humidity compensation using YSZ-based acetone sensors, demonstrating excellent application potential in rigorous detection scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Nonspecific adsorption remains a persistent obstacle in biosensing applications, as it adversely impacts key performance indicators of biosensors such as sensitivity, specificity, and operational stability. Although conventional antifouling peptides have achieved much success, their practical utility is often constrained by susceptibility to enzymatic hydrolysis as natural enzymes exist in biological fluids. Herein, a robust nonfouling biosensor is proposed based on a newly designed peptide (δ-P) with both antifouling, antienzymatic degradation and recognition capabilities, functionalized with a δ-L-lysinyl-L-glutamic acid dimer. Crucially, the antifouling domain of the peptide is composed of a δ-L-lysinyl-L-glutamic acid dimer (glutamic acid with the lysine side chain), and the recognition domain specific for the protein ANXA1 is composed of D-type amino acids, and both of them are capable of resisting enzymatic degradation. Two types of proteases (alkaline protease and trypsin), which represent less site-specific and site-specific cleavage proteases, respectively, were tested to illustrate proteolysis. Taking advantages of the designed peptide, a highly sensitive and low-fouling electrochemical biosensor (with a linear range of 0.001-1000 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> and a detection limit of 0.32 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>), capable of assaying protein ANXA1 in human sera, was prepared by attaching the peptide onto the electrode modified with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-sodium alginate (PEDOT@SA) film and gold nanoparticles. More interestingly, the biosensor showed satisfactory accuracy for the detection of ANXA1 in undiluted clinical serum samples (verified by the ELISA method). It is anticipated that the peptide designing strategy presented in this work can be easily extended to the development of various robust antifouling biosensors capable of assaying targets in complex biological environments.",

    "Abstract": "Natural products remain a vital source of therapeutic innovation, but their structural complexity often limits the systematic optimization and clinical translation. This challenge is exemplified by the fungal metabolite fumagillin, a covalent inhibitor of methionine aminopeptidase 2 (MetAP2), which advanced toward clinical development but whose semisynthetic derivatives were discontinued in trials for cancer and obesity because of adverse effects. To overcome these barriers, we reengineered the fumagillin biosynthetic pathway in <i>Aspergillus nidulans</i> to expand chemical diversity, uncovering its natural analog ovalicin as a more potent agent active against <i>Entamoeba histolytica</i>. Although ovalicin had never been developed clinically, our analyses revealed that its rapid degradation by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes underlies its therapeutic ineffectiveness in preclinical studies. We then established a chem-bio hybrid platform that integrates pathway-engineered biosynthesis with site-selective chemical derivatization to address this metabolic fragility. Introduction of a C6-hydroxyl group as a built-in functional handle enabled preparative-scale diversification and the synthesis of about 30 analogs. Several C6-modified derivatives maintained subnanomolar MetAP2 inhibition, resisted P450-mediated metabolism, and exhibited negligible cytotoxicity. Two optimized compounds, YOK24 and NS-181, achieved complete resolution of amebic liver abscess in hamsters after both subcutaneous and oral administration. Together, these findings establish a general and broadly applicable strategy for the biosynthetic reprogramming of natural products, providing a blueprint for expanding the chemical and therapeutic space of complex metabolites beyond conventional synthetic and biosynthetic limits.",

    "Abstract": "Rapid detection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a crucial tool in the global fight against antimicrobial resistance, helping to limit the spread of resistance and guide treatment decisions. Here, we report the design, synthesis, and electrochemical evaluation of β-lactam-based redox-activatable probes for detecting β-lactamase activity. The probes incorporate a β-lactam core linked to redox reporters through cleavable linkages, enabling signal generation upon enzymatic hydrolysis. High-performance liquid chromatography and differential pulse voltammetry analyses were used to assess time-dependent activation and concentration-dependent responses against commercial β-lactamase blends and metallo-β-lactamases. Selected probes, bearing cephalosporin recognition motifs and maltol redox reporters, were further evaluated against clinical isolates, demonstrating selective activation in carbapenemase-producing strains. To extend the platform toward solid-state biosensing, an azide-functionalized analog was clicked on alkyne-modified glassy carbon electrodes. Stepwise surface functionalization and immobilization were validated electrochemically using model redox reporters, confirming their activity. The immobilized probe retained responsiveness, demonstrating the feasibility of integrating this sensing strategy into solid-state diagnostic devices. By integrating stable cephalosporin scaffolds with redox-reporter signaling, this work introduces a novel probe system that unites chemical probe design with surface-based electrochemical sensing, providing a strong foundation for the development of portable, point-of-care diagnostics for β-lactamase-mediated antibiotic resistance.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: The rise of information technology has expanded job opportunities, leading many individuals to pursue multiple professions or side-hustles alongside their full-time work. Grounded in role expansion theory, our research examined the relationship between full-time work task conflicts and side-hustle creativity. We used both an experimental study ( N = 188) and a questionnaire survey ( N = 271) to test all hypotheses. The results show that full-time work task conflicts stimulate side-hustle engagement, subsequently fostering side-hustle creativity. In addition, individuals’ performance-avoidance goal orientation weakens the positive effect of full-time work task conflict on side-hustle engagement. Our findings enrich the research related to multiple professions, offering practical insights to the career development of individuals managing both full-time work and side-hustle pursuits.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Copper, predominantly present in bones, plays a crucial role in bone formation. However, when copper homeostasis is disrupted, excessive copper can trigger harmful inflammation and a novel form of cell death known as cuproptosis. The impact of cuproptosis on bone metabolism remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that excessive copper acts as an aggravator in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. We observed that the expression levels of the copper importer SLC31A1 and dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT) were positively correlated with bone loss in both human chronic apical periodontitis (CAP) tissues and mouse CAP models. Untargeted metabolomics analysis and screening of glucose metabolism enzymes revealed that glycogen synthesis was inhibited during cuproptosis. Mechanistically, excessive copper hindered glycogen synthesis via glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1), which limited the availability of glycogenolysis-derived glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) flux into pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and was unable to yield abundant NADPH to ensure high demand of glutathione (GSH) for macrophage survival. The inhibition of glycogen synthesis intensified cuproptosis and bone-resorption activity. Moreover, excessive copper bound to H3K27me3, which further epigenetically inhibited the gene transcription of GYS1, thereby affecting glycogen synthesis and exacerbating cuproptosis and bone resorption. Furthermore, the disruption of glycogen metabolism intensified cuproptosis and promoted inflammatory bone loss in vivo. Our finding highlighted the complex interplay among copper homeostasis, glycogen metabolism, and the osteo-immune system, suggesting new therapeutic strategies for managing inflammatory bone diseases and other copper accumulation-related conditions through the metabolic reprogramming of cells.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Enamel, the inorganic tissue covering the crowns of teeth, is known for its remarkable resilience and hardness. These properties originate from its high proportion of mineralized matrix and complex internal microarchitecture. On an ultrastructural level, it consists of directionally arranged enamel prisms. Continuously growing rodent incisors are an exemplary case of this phenomenon. Their enamel has a consistent decussation pattern, providing teeth with extremely high resistance and ensuring they remain constantly sharp. While the decussation pattern has been described in detail, mechanisms behind its formation have not been experimentally proven. Here, we show that the highly organized enamel micropattern is generated by directional epithelial sliding of enamel-forming ameloblasts in vivo. Our results detail how enamel micropatterning stems from individual cell cluster segregation and subsequent reciprocal interweaving. Based on this determination, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a new model of enamel decussation pattern formation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract High-throughput trapping and precision manipulation of individual pathogenic bioparticles in complex microenvironments are of great importance for in-vitro diagnostics and drug screening. Although optical tweezers have been widely used for bioparticle trapping and manipulation, the throughput, functionality, and adaptability are still limited for on-chip integrated bioparticle manipulation in complex and dynamic bioenvironments. Here, we report flexible, stretchable, on-chip optical tweezers (FSOT) based on large-scale orderly assembled microlenses for high-throughput manipulation of bioparticles in complex bio-environments and on flexible substrates, including soft bio-substrates such as skin and intestines. Large-scale (up to 1000) photonic nanojet effect of the microlenses enables high-throughput trapping, sorting, and modulation of individual bioparticles with sizes ranging from sub-100 nm to tens of micrometers, such as exosomes, bacteria and mammalian cells. Our FSOT exhibits high flexibility, which enables bioparticle trapping and sorting in complex and curved biological microenvironments. Importantly, our FSOT also exhibits high deformability and stretchability, which facilitates the control of inter-cellular distance between trapped neighboring cells, enabling real-time modulating and monitoring the interaction between single pathogenic bacteria and macrophage. Our FSOT represents a new class of on-chip optical tweezers for high-throughput bioparticle trapping and manipulation with the features of high flexibility and stretchability, and holds great promises as an integrated on-chip platform for high-throughput dynamic analysis of bioparticles, for revealing inter-cellular interactions between pathogenic bioparticles and host cells, and for precise drug screening.",

    "Abstract": "Establishing robust pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics (PK-PD) correlations remains a major challenge owing to high selectivity and low permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which limits the predictive power of conventional plasma pharmacokinetics on specific brain tissue. Here, we present a highly biomimetic microfluidic BBB-brain organ-on-a-chip combined with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and electrochemical sensing technology for micro PK-PD monitoring with target cells. The platform incorporates human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells and neuron-like cells cultured on opposite sides of a collagen/fibronectin-modified porous membrane under physiological shear stress. This configuration reinforces the physical, metabolic and physiological barrier functions of BBB, as evidenced by the high expression of tight junction proteins, low apparent permeability, expression of efflux transporters, and reversible response to hypertonic stimuli. A neurodegenerative disease model is induced using 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium iodide (MPP<sup>+</sup>) to recapitulate key pathological features of early-stage Parkinson's disease. The pharmacokinetic profile of pramipexole (PPX) is monitored using both LC-MS and an integrated, regenerable electrochemical sensor. The sensor enables in situ, real-time and online detection of PPX with high sensitivity and specificity, showing strong concordance with LC-MS. Furthermore, neurotransmitter (norepinephrine) exocytosis level is quantified as a pharmacodynamic indicator, enabling micro PK-PD correlation within the disease-on-a-chip model. Collectively, the proposed new method for micro PK-PD study is expected to provide great prospects for the preclinical screening and action mechanism research of novel anti-Parkinson's disease drugs.",

    "Abstract": "Surface acoustic wave radio frequency identification (SAW RFID) has gained widespread adoption in remote sensing and identification. However, conventional SAW RFID tags suffer from significant energy loss due to the inherently low reflectance of standard reflectors, fundamentally limiting their wireless interrogation range. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel SAW RFID architecture employing reflective multistrip couplers (RMSCs), which exploit the velocity difference between symmetric and antisymmetric wave modes to achieve coherent reflection, thereby circumventing conventional electrical or mechanical reflection mechanisms. Numerical simulations were conducted to analyze performance deterioration induced by parasitic resistances and capacitance and to identify the optimal strip number for peak reflectance. The fabricated RMSC reflector achieves a low loss of 1 dB, with a reflectance difference of merely 0.33 dB compared to the simulation results. A 433 MHz SAW RFID prototype implementing RMSC reflectors on a 128°YX-LiNbO<sub>3</sub> single-crystal substrate demonstrated a -10.63 dB peak time-domain amplitude at room temperature, representing a substantial improvement over conventional designs. Temperature characterization from -20 °C to 90 °C revealed linear functions in time delay and phase responses, with coefficients of determination (R<sup>2</sup>) exceeding 0.9999. These results validate the RMSC reflector as a high-reflectance solution for enhancing SAW RFID performance, suggesting significant potential for long-range wireless sensing applications.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract ‘Light-mills’ are optically driven microstructures that can exchange orbital angular momentum with light and thus rotate around a central axis with a controlled applied torque. Although many studies have explored the employment of light momentum for torque generation, only a few convincing applications in cellular and molecular biology have been demonstrated. Here, we design a 3D chiral structure that can be selectively coupled to a target nanometric flagellar motor in a live E. coli cell, functioning as an external, tunable torque clamp. We optimize our 3D microstructures for torque conversion efficiency and mechanical stability, and propose a calibration protocol that enables absolute quantification of the torque generated by the flagellar motor during rotation in both its natural and reverse directions. Our results demonstrate that microfabricated light-mills expand the optical toolbox for biomechanical study of individual rotary motors by enabling controlled torque application and measurement at the nanoscale.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Converging lines of evidence implicate synaptic loss in cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. However, it remains unknown whether synaptic terminal density and premorbid intellectual functioning are related in vivo, or whether there are age-related changes in them in schizophrenia. To address this, we investigated whole brain grey matter synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) levels and examined their relationship with intellectual functioning and age, in forty-three patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and 26 healthy volunteers (HV), using [ 11 C]UCB-J positron emission tomography (PET). Whole brain grey matter [ 11 C]UCB-J distribution volume ratio (DVR) was significantly lower in the SCZ than the HV group (Cohen’s d = 0.64, p = 0.01), and negatively correlated with age in both groups (Spearman’s rho = –0.46 to –0.55), with no significant group difference in magnitude of DVR-age correlations ( z = 0.44, p = 0.66). Current (Cohen’s d = 0.73) and premorbid IQ (Cliff’s delta = 0.37) were significantly lower in the SCZ than the HV group, though DVR was not significantly associated with current or premorbid IQ in either group (including in chronic medicated and early-course unmedicated SCZ subgroups). The group differences in DVR are consistent with a global deficit in synaptic terminal density in schizophrenia, with similar age-related changes in people with schizophrenia and healthy volunteers. The lack of significant relationships between DVR and premorbid or current cognitive measures are not consistent with the hypothesis that lower levels of synaptic terminal density observed in schizophrenia underlie lower levels of intellectual functioning in the disorder.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Pediatric epilepsy may adversely affect cardiac function. This study examined cardiac outcomes in children with controlled and drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Methods Sixty children with epilepsy (30 DRE, 30 drug-responsive) and 30 healthy controls underwent 12-lead ECG, M-mode echocardiography, and speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) to assess cardiac electrical activity, left ventricular (LV) volumes, ejection fraction (EF), fractional shortening (FS), and global longitudinal strain (GLS). Results ECG findings were comparable among the three groups. LV end-diastolic (LVEDV) and end-systolic volumes (LVESV), FS, and EF were significantly lower in DRE vs. controls ( p &lt; 0.05). LVEDV and EF were significantly lower in DRE vs. drug-responsive epilepsy ( p &lt; 0.05), while drug-responsive cases had lower LVEDV vs. controls ( p = 0.015). LV GLS was significantly lower in DRE (−19.34 ± 1.80) vs. drug-responsive epilepsy (−20.33 ± 1.45) ( p = 0.023) and controls (−20.58 ± 0.91) ( p = 0.003). LV GLS correlated positively with time since last seizure ( p = 0.007) and negatively with the number of antiseizure medications ( p = 0.007). Conclusions Children with DRE exhibit significant cardiac dysfunction. STE enables early detection of subclinical cardiac abnormalities in DRE, advocating for its integration into routine monitoring. Impact Compares cardiac function in pediatric drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) and drug-responsive epilepsy, identifying impaired systolic function and global longitudinal strain (GLS) in DRE. Correlates GLS abnormalities with antiseizure medication burden and time since last seizure, linking cardiac dysfunction to treatment intensity and epilepsy disease course. Advocates STE for early cardiac monitoring in DRE and urges longitudinal studies to disentangle epilepsy-related cardiovascular risks from drug-driven effects.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The high mortality caused by severe COVID-19 poses great challenges to the public health. However, the underlying pathogenesis of severe cases remains unclear. Here, we find that SARS-CoV-2 infection boosts CD147 inducible up-regulation in the lung tissues of virus-infected rhesus macaques coupled with down-regulated membrane-bound ACE2, which conduces to extended virus infection and severe pathological lesions. Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 infection enhances the expression of transcriptional factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor and facilitates its nucleus translocation, which causes CD147 gene transcription and its up-regulation in protein level, thereby leading to virus susceptibility of the hosts and extended virus infection. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggers immune imbalance of lung tissues by promoting cell death of CD4 + T cells and B cells and mediating abnormal cell-cell communications, especially for M2 macrophages. Meplazumab, a humanized anti-CD147 antibody, effectively inhibits virus entry and cytokine level, and restores immune balance in the lung tissues of virus-infected rhesus macaque model. Importantly, we further present the cryo-EM structure of CD147-spike complex, and identify five pairs of functional residues for their interaction, which could be interrupted by Meplazumab via steric hindrance effect. Our findings provide direct evidence for CD147-SARS-CoV-2 spike interaction and uncover the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 caused by CD147-mediated extended virus infection.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely prescribed antidepressants, though their mechanisms of action beyond serotonin transporter (SERT) blockade remain unclear [1]. As previous work on BOLD signal changes remain equivocal, pharmacological multimodal neuroimaging of energy demands and blood flow (CBF) holds promise due to increased specificity of these signals. This may advance the understanding of the involved pharmacodynamic mechanisms and guide treatment strategies of highly prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders. We combine new techniques of functional positron emission tomography (fPET) with high temporal resolution (3 seconds) using [ 18 F]FDG and simultaneously acquired pseudo-continuous arterial spin labelling (pcASL). Thus, we aimed for a highly quantitative assessment of changes in brain activation following an intravenous SSRI challenge using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design. We demonstrate acute drug induced changes in glucose metabolism (K i ) in serotonergic projections, i.e. the striatum and the occipital cortex in 16 healthy volunteers (7 females). In an exploratory analysis, acute effects were observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus. We did not observe corresponding changes in CBF, which suggests that observed SSRI effects are specific to brain energy demands. Our results complement the existing literature on the acute pharmacological effects of SSRIs by providing insights in specific aspects of neuronal activation. Moreover, our findings expand upon the results of existing BOLD fMRI studies and, thus, support the application of this pharmacological neuroimaging protocol in psychopharmacological research.",

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are considered as good prognostic models and potential therapeutic targets for cancer patients because of their easy detection and strong correlation. Our study identifies an OC-associated lncRNA with tumor progression and therapeutic implications. It’s found that lncRNA AC093895.1 is highly expressed in OC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis. AC093895.1 has a potentiating effect during the progression and metastasis of ovarian cancer. The effects of AC093895.1 on ovarian cancer cells are miR-1253 dependent. Results showed that by interacting with tumor-suppressive gene miR-1253 as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNAs), AC093895.1 significantly upregulated the downstream gene SOX4 of AC093895.1/ miR-1253 axis, leading to tumor metastasis. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) results further confirmed that SOX4 could bind to the AC093895.1 promoter, forming a positive feedback loop SOX4/AC093895.1/miR-1253/SOX4. Therapeutic strategy to break the loop through AC093895.1 knockdown exhibited attenuated OC growth and metastasis in vivo both in SK-OV-3 subcutaneous model and pulmonary metastatic model. Our study unveiled the potentiating effects of SOX4/AC093895.1/miR-1253/SOX4 on ovarian cancer cell survival, migration, and invasion. AC093895.1 may be a promising patient prognostic biomarker and therapeutic candidate.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are widely used in clinical oncology owing to their effectiveness against various tumors. However, by enhancing their immune responses, these inhibitors can trigger immune-related adverse events (irAEs) affecting various organ systems. Notably, pulmonary complications, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitor-related pneumonitis (ICIP), have emerged as one of the leading causes of treatment-related mortality in patients receiving ICIs. Given the limitations of current ICIP treatments, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising therapeutic strategy owing to their immunomodulatory properties and ability to promote tissue repair. This article reviews recent advances in ICIP and proposes the potential applications of MSC therapy, emphasizing the need for further research into its efficacy and safety to improve ICIP management.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Mechanical forces are emerging physical cues that regulate biochemical signals of immune cells for antitumor immunity. Owing to the lack of precise tools to impose intracellular forces, little is known about whether and how organelle-level forces trigger mechanotransduction for antitumor immunity. Here, we developed a magneto-mechanical force-triggered lysosomal membrane permeabilization (MagLMP) strategy to induce durable macrophage repolarization for in vivo applications. Self-assembled magnetic nanomotors are driven by rotational magnetic fields, facilitating dynamic damage to the lysosomal membrane by a finely tuned torque-induced vortex. Intriguingly, galectin 9 (Gal9) was found to be critical for sensing cyclic MagLMP, which dynamically activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), enhanced activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and induced metabolic alterations for sustained M1-like macrophage repolarization, followed by mounting of antitumor immunity. Through single-cell RNA sequencing of tumor tissues, as well as macrophage depletion-reconstitution models involving intratumoral transfer of Gal9 -KO bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and AMPK shRNA-transduced Gal9 -KO BMDMs, we confirmed the Gal9-AMPK-NF-κB axis as the essential pathway by which MagLMP functions in antitumor therapy. In a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma in situ, overall survival was extended after intravenous administration of nanomotors followed by cyclic MagLMP, and one third of mice survived for more than 300 days. Together, these results demonstrate an intracellular mechanical strategy that can dynamically manipulate innate immune responses in vivo, providing a tool for durable immunotherapy through organelle mechanotransduction.",

    "Abstract": "A major goal of biomedical research is to assign functions to the myriad alternative RNA and protein isoforms. This challenge is particularly relevant to the mammalian nervous system, which produces complex repertoires of alternative splicing events. Here, we describe CHyMErA-seq, a platform that couples systematic deletion of exons to a single cell transcriptomics read-out, and apply this method to investigate a critical program of brain-specific microexons. Perturbation of microexons during neurogenesis reveals convergent roles in the temporal regulation of gene expression programs that direct signaling pathways and morphogenesis. We further observe microexons, including those in the Bin1, Clasp1, Gfra1, Med23, Ptprf and Ralgapb genes, that are required for the correct timing of autism-linked gene expression. Collectively, we describe a flexible system for isoform-resolution perturbation at a single cell level, together with insights into the roles of microexons in the developmental timing of neurogenesis transcriptomic signatures linked to brain disorders.",

    "Abstract": "In vitro models can recapitulate aspects of human liver diseases, thereby aiding therapeutic development. Dynamic interactions with vascular and immune cells contribute to disease progression in ways that are challenging to capture in the hepatic spheroid models commonly used for assessing facets of metabolism and disease. To address this, we developed a microphysiological system (MPS) featuring multicellular human hepatic spheroids physically integrated with self-organized microvascular networks. We demonstrate this MPS's utility by modeling an insulin resistance state, where chronic exposure to disease-mimetic conditions yields altered hepatocyte metabolism, dysregulated vascular features, and increased inflammation state. We extend this system to capture disease-relevant changes in immune cell recruitment, showing that monocytes perfused through the vasculature will extravasate toward hepatic spheroids, with insulin-resistant samples exhibiting greater infiltration. Altogether, this vascularized liver MPS captures local hepatocyte-immune-microvascular interactions in an accessible microfluidic platform, enabling the study of clinically relevant immune-tissue interactions in complex metabolic disease.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract When the species composition of ecological communities changes over time, environmental drivers are often invoked as the most plausible explanation. Several lines of reasoning, however, suggest that such compositional change, called temporal species turnover, can similarly result from intrinsic ecosystem dynamics, even in a constant environment. The degree to which these two drivers contribute to observed turnover remains unclear. To address this conundrum, we analyse the well-established BioTIME database of surveys. We expect either an acceleration of turnover with accelerating climate change or constant turnover if intrinsic mechanisms dominate. Surprisingly we find instead that species turnover over short time intervals (1-5 years) has decelerated in significantly more communities during the last 100 years than it has accelerated, typically by one third. The observed slowing of turnover, we argue, could be understood—when intrinsic dynamics dominate—as resulting because anthropogenic environmental degradation or declines of regional species pools reduce the number of potential colonisers driving turnover. Our results suggest that observed past changes in species composition were often manifestations of natural, intrinsic ecosystem dynamics. Although one can expect environmental drivers to dominate species turnover eventually as climate change accelerates further, for now such attribution should be done with caution.",

The mechanisms driving uveitis development in JIA remain understudied. Here, we demonstrate that peripheral blood CD19 + IgD - CD27 - double negative type 1 (DN1) B cells are elevated in JIA-uveitis compared to JIA patients without eye disease (JIA). The B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire was also more clonal and somatically hypermutated in JIA-uveitis and antigen-activated B cells infiltrated chronically inflamed JIA-uveitis eyes. Features of heightened B cell activation were recapitulated in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) and disrupting B and T cell interactions using monoclonal antibodies and transgenic mice suppresses uveitis. Together, these findings support a conceptual shift that uveitis is a primarily T cell driven disease and provide evidence for potential new therapeutic strategies that also consider B cells as drivers in disease pathology.",

To systematically investigate its role in cell fate determination, we develop scCHyMErA-Seq, a scalable CRISPR-based exon deletion screening platform integrated with 10x Genomics single-cell transcriptomic readouts. This tool enables efficient exon deletion while simultaneously capturing Cas9/Cas12a guides and polyadenylated transcripts at single-cell resolution. Applying scCHyMErA-Seq to high-throughput profiling of alternative cassette exons, we identify numerous exons with pronounced regulatory effects on gene expression and cell cycle progression. Analysis of the alternative NRF1 exon-7 demonstrates that its inclusion modulates NRF1’s regulatory function by influencing its recruitment to the promoters of target genes. Importantly, gene expression profiles generated using scCHyMErA-Seq accurately recapitulate findings from traditional, labor-intensive orthogonal methods, while offering enhanced scalability and efficiency. Overall, scCHyMErA-Seq represents a versatile platform for systematically unraveling the functional impact of alternative splicing by directly linking specific splicing variants to transcriptional phenotypes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Recently, copper(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click chemistry has emerged as a promising approach for designing new artificial metallo-nucleases (AMNs) with DNA-damaging properties. By functionalising a central organic azide with three alkyne donors, Tri-Click (TC) ligands capable of chelating three copper ions through the donor group and triazole linker can be generated. However, the versatility of this approach along with the influence of specific donors on metal binding, DNA recognition, and cellular DNA damage in an anticancer context remains poorly understood. Here, we prepare a series of Tri-Click ligands incorporating systematic cyclic and acyclic N-, O-, and S-donors and evaluate their AMN activities. Screening experiments pinpoint planar N-donor ligands as high value agents. Among these, the copper complex of Tri-Click-Pyridine (Cu 3 -TC-Py) displays significant potential. We characterise its activity using single-molecule imaging, microscale thermophoresis, FRET-based binding assays, molecular dynamics, and intracellular DNA interaction studies in human and functional bacterial cells. We report the emergence of Cu 3 -TC-Py as a lead AMN with high reactivity for DNA damage applications central to anticancer therapy.",

While the prefrontal cortex is critical for cognition and learning, how it leverages salience information remains unclear. We report that chandelier cells (ChCs) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a unique GABAergic interneuron, encode salience information and influence learning. Using cell-type-specific calcium signal recording in male mice, we demonstrate that ChCs respond robustly to stimuli across modalities, with responses dependent on stimulus salience, as determined by novelty and intensity. Circuit-specific manipulations reveal that ChC salience coding is attributable to synaptic inputs from the anterior insular cortex and paraventricular thalamus. Furthermore, ChCs acquire salience-coding property for behaviorally relevant stimuli through associative learning. Notably, bidirectional manipulations of ChC-mediated salience detection correspondingly led to improved or impaired associative learning. Together, these findings establish mPFC ChCs as a key circuit element for processing salience information to shape learning and behavior.",

    "Abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is associated with bile duct disorders in immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, including sclerosing cholangitis, biliary structures, AIDS cholangiopathy, biliary atresia (BA), and post-transplant biliary complications. Despite these clinical associations, it remains unknown whether HCMV can directly infect the bile duct epithelium and cause pathogenesis. Here, we establish a human iPSC-derived cholangiocyte-like cell (CLC) organoid model that can be infected by HCMV, which results in reduced organoid growth, a deformed structure, and a loss of barrier function. Bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) showed that the HCMV-infected organoids had highly enriched expression of genes involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Importantly, blockade of TGF-β signalling abrogates the EMT induction effect in the HCMV-infected CLC organoids. Furthermore, single-cell RNA-seq indicates that HCMV infection occurred in different clusters with distinct viral and host gene expression profiles and the analysis shows increased expression of EMT and TGF-β signalling-related genes. The findings are confirmed in BA patient liver tissues by examining HCMV-DNA<sup>+</sup> cells. Two modes of infection by HCMV are found in these CLC organoids, which show productive and latency-like features. This study shows that HCMV infection induces EMT in cholangiocytes that may contribute to the cholangiopathy seen in various diseases.",

    "Abstract": "The involvement of intestinal microbiota in the process of neutrophil-mediated colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRCLM) is not yet fully understood. Here, we show that Escherichia coli (E. coli) is prevalent in CRC tissues with LM using 2bRAD-M-Seq and is linked to the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Utilizing multi-omics and molecular techniques, we establish that E. coli recruits RIPK2, which promotes the binding of HNRNPK to the Atf3/Relb promoters in neutrophils, thereby enhancing their transcription. This process results in the upregulation of Ncf4, which triggers p-MLKL-mediated NET formation. NETs, in turn, increase the expression of TRPC1 and NFATC3 in CRC cells, promoting the calcium-dependent assembly of the STAT3/S100A8/9 heterotrimer. This trimer stabilizes STAT3-enhancer-promoter loops (EPLs), thereby reinforcing the Tns1 transcription and facilitating CRCLM. Our findings elucidate the mechanism by which E. coli-induced NETs promote CRCLM through epigenetic modifications, offering an insight into the role of EPLs in immune regulation and tumor progression.",

    "Abstract": "An efficient carbon capture and release system necessitates rapid CO<sub>2</sub> transport to and from active sites, a property typically associated with permanently porous materials featuring large surface areas. Here, we present hydrophobic organic crystals of alkylated monoethanolamine that, despite their nonporous nature, undergo a rapid and reversible solid-to-solid phase transition upon CO₂ uptake and release. Exposure to CO<sub>2</sub> triggers a thermodynamically favored structural rearrangement, enabling quantitative CO<sub>2</sub> capture and forming a stable carbamate, aided by intermolecular interactions involving the long side chains. This process is fully reversible under practical flue-gas CO<sub>2</sub> capture conditions (>0.6% CO<sub>2</sub>, 0-100% relative humidity) and enables low-temperature desorption using CO<sub>2</sub> itself as a stripping gas (65 °C at 1 atm CO<sub>2</sub>). Structural analysis through in situ XRPD, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, electron diffraction, and Raman analysis confirms that these hydrophobic absorbents selectively uptake CO<sub>2</sub> to form an anhydrous ammonium carbamate pair in the solid state. The non-hygroscopic nature of these organic crystals is exemplified by a representative C10-MEA in the presence of CO<sub>2,</sub> resulting in a desorption process with a minimal temperature swing (ΔT<sub>abs-des</sub> = 30 °C), offering an energy-efficient (>1.2 GJ/t of captured CO₂) and economically viable alternative for carbon capture applications.",

We identify two bacterial effectors of the Virulence-Modifying (VM) proteins family, structurally related to toxin-like proteins, that promote modulation of calcium homeostasis and disruption of cell-cell junctions, thereby allowing Leptospira translocation across epithelium barriers, tissue colonization and pathogenicity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that at least one of these VM proteins is secreted and associates with host cells. Altogether, these findings reveal a unique strategy by which an extracellular pathogen secretes toxin-like proteins to exploit host calcium signaling for breaching epithelial barriers.",

    "Abstract": "Paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel differ in therapeutic efficacy and modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment, yet the molecular basis remains poorly defined. Here, based on a meta-analysis, we first show that treatment with nab-paclitaxel results in a higher overall response rate and pathological complete response compared to paclitaxel in female patients with breast cancer. Notably, TREM2 expression in macrophages is elevated in primary tumors of paclitaxel- but not nab-paclitaxel-treated female patients. In metastatic breast cancer, TREM2<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration is increased in primary tumors. In breast cancer models in female mice, paclitaxel, but not nab-paclitaxel, promotes lung metastasis by recruiting TREM2<sup>+</sup> macrophages to primary tumors. Mechanistically, paclitaxel enhances the ATF3-FGF2 axis in breast cancer cells; secreted FGF2 activates the EGR1-TREM2-EMT cytokine axis in macrophages. Genetic ablation of Trem2 or pharmacologic targeting with antisense oligonucleotides suppress paclitaxel-induced breast cancer lung metastasis in vivo. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that paclitaxel, but not nab-paclitaxel, stimulates TREM2 expression and expands TREM2<sup>+</sup> macrophages, suggesting that TREM2 targeting could enhance paclitaxel efficacy while limiting metastasis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) play a central role in the pathophysiology of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). This single-arm, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ASC-depleting anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab in patients with SLE (NCT04810754). The primary endpoint is the reduction in serum anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels at week 12. Key secondary end points include safety, clinical efficacy, and immunologic changes. Ten female patients with active disease and inadequate responses to at least two immunosuppressive drugs have received eight subcutaneous injections of 1800 mg daratumumab weekly, with dexamethasone as premedication (20 mg for first two injections, then 10 mg). By week 12, anti-dsDNA antibody levels have been reduced by a median of 109.6 IU/ml (95% CI 38.1 – 274.5). The treatment resulted in rapid and sustained clinical improvements across all patients and organ domains, reflected by a 100% SRI-4 (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index-4) response rate at week 12. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 5/10 patients, requiring immunoglobulin substitution. Daratumumab treatment has depleted circulating ASCs, reduced type I interferon activity, and profoundly modulated the T-cell responses. These findings highlight the pivotal role of ASCs in SLE pathogenesis and support daratumumab as therapeutic option for SLE.",

    "Abstract": "Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a severe foodborne pathogen that can lead to hemolytic uremic syndrome. However, antibiotics are contraindicated for EHEC treatment due to toxin release and gut microbiota disruption. Here we report a dual‑mechanism therapeutic strategy combining an engineered Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 strain (EcN3) with 2'‑fucosyllactose (2‑FL) delivered via multicompartment microspheres (MCMs). EcN3 expresses α‑L‑fucosidase to hydrolyze 2‑FL into lactose and fucose. Lactose enhances glucuronic acid utilization, limiting a preferred nutrient of EHEC, whereas fucose activates FusKR signaling to suppress virulence gene expression. MCMs confer gastric protection and enable targeted colonic release, ensuring coordinated activity. In female mouse models and infant rabbit models of Citrobacter rodentium and EHEC infection, this system reduces intestinal colonization, virulence gene expression and epithelial damage without inducing Shiga toxin production. Moreover, MCMs-based strategy preserves the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, and promotes intestinal integrity. This targeted strategy presents a viable alternative to antibiotics, addressing EHEC pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The silicon photovoltaics market is transitioning from the incumbent passivated emitter rear cell to the higher efficiency tunnel oxide passivated contact technology and it is crucial to understand the environmental impact of this change. Here, we conduct life cycle assessment to compare both technologies quantitatively and identify environmental savings in 15 of 16 environmental impact categories for tunnel oxide passivated contact. This includes a 6.5% reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, per watt peak at the expense of 15.2% increase in metal resource use, for photovoltaic modules manufactured in China and transported to central Europe. A critical factor in photovoltaics manufacturing is the carbon intensity of the electricity mix. We model the impact of photovoltaics production across different global regions, incorporating future electricity mix scenarios and a projection for photovoltaics deployment. Our model provides a forecast of the environmental impact of global photovoltaics manufacturing and identifies a potential reduction of 8.2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2035, depending on manufacturing location.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The coexistence and horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factor genes (VFGs) carried by urban wildlife represent an emerging form of biological pollution, constituting a significant threat to public health. We employed meta-omic approaches to evaluate the effects of host traits (sex, age, etc.), environmental factors (including geographical location and time), and diet (including food composition and antibiotic residues) on the bacterial, ARG, and VFG profiles of Vespertilio sinensis , an urban-dwelling bat. Our results demonstrate that the feces of V. sinensis harbor diverse ARGs and VFGs, but their genomic evidence for horizontal mobility in bacterial communities is limited. Notably, environmental changes over time and across geographical locations are associated with the ARG and VFG profiles, potentially due to the influence of pollutants in specific habitats. Dietary factors are associated with their dynamics through the microbiome, with antibiotic residues exerting selective pressure on ARG profiles. No significant impacts of sex, age, body size, and reproductive status on the gut microbiota, resistome, or virulome were observed. This study provides valuable insights into the ecological drivers of the gut microbiome, resistome, and virulome in bats, thereby contributing to our understanding of the public health risks associated with urban wildlife.",

Recently diagnosed subjects with confirmatory Dopamine Transporter Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (DaT-SPECT) scans were randomized to daily Vodobatinib 384 mg, 192 mg, or placebo. The primary endpoint in Part 1 was the change from baseline to Week 40 in the Movement Disorder Society - Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III total score; Part 2 was an optional 36-week extension. There was a high, dose-related rate of early withdrawal. The mean score of completers in the placebo group was slightly lower than at baseline of the entire cohort. Comparisons with either dose group favored the placebo. Serum neurofilament light chains increased significantly in both Vodobatinib groups, supporting inefficacy in PD.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract DOT1L and Menin are essential cofactors for the oncogenic activity of MLL fusion proteins (MLL-FPs) in leukaemia. However, the mechanisms underpinning the therapeutic effects of their inhibitors remain unclear. Here we identify a critical role for the non-canonical Polycomb repressive complex 1.1 (PRC1.1) in mediating the cellular responses to DOT1L and Menin inhibitors. Menin inhibition induces PRC1.1-dependent deposition of H2AK119ub to silence a subset of MLL-FP targets, whereas DOT1L inhibition results in a genome-wide increase in H2AK119ub. We show that enhanced PRC1.1 activity arises specifically from the progressive loss of DOT1L-mediated H3K79 methylation, independent of MLL-FP displacement or transcriptional repression. This regulatory crosstalk is conserved across cell types and is driven by direct biochemical antagonism between H3K79 methylation and PRC1 activity. Together, our findings establish DOT1L as a component of transcriptional memory co-opted in leukaemia and suggest it serves as the missing link balancing the opposing forces of the MLL–Polycomb axis.",

Here, we present a genome-wide association meta-analysis comprising 122,341 European ancestry ANX cases and 729,881 controls. We identified 58 independent genome-wide significant risk variants and 66 genes with robust biological support. In an independent sample of 1,175,012 self-report ANX cases and 1,956,379 controls, 51 out of the 58 associations replicated. As predicted by twin studies, we found substantial genetic correlation between ANX and depression, neuroticism and other internalizing phenotypes. Follow-up analyses demonstrated enrichment in all major brain regions and highlighted GABAergic signaling as one potential mechanism implicated in ANX genetic risk. These results advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of ANX and prioritize genes for functional follow-up studies.",

Here we characterized 007, a V3 glycan site bNAb exhibiting high levels of antiviral activity against multiclade pseudovirus panels. 007 targets an N332 gp120 glycan-independent V3 epitope, a site of the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) vulnerability to which only weakly neutralizing antibodies had previously been identified. Functional analyses demonstrated distinct binding and neutralization profiles compared to classical V3 glycan site bNAbs. A 007 Fab-Env cryogenic electron microscopy structure revealed contacts with the V3 324 GD/NIR 327 motif and interactions with N156 gp120 and N301 gp120 glycans. In contrast to classical V3 bNAbs, 007 binding to Env does not depend on the N332 gp120 glycan, rendering it resistant to common escape mutations. Structures of 007 IgG-Env trimer complexes showed two Env trimers crosslinked by three bivalent IgGs. Bivalent 007 IgG was more potent than monovalent 007 IgG heterodimer, suggesting a role for avidity in potent neutralization. Finally, in HIV-1 ADA -infected humanized mice, 007 caused transient decline of viremia and overcame classical V3 escape mutations, highlighting 007’s potential for HIV-1 prevention, therapy, functional cure and vaccine design.",

A single immunization elicits low inhibitory serum and monoclonal antibodies that are boosted and affinity matured with a heterologous immunogen. Electron microscopy polyclonal epitope mapping analysis of serum antibodies, antibody cloning and cryogenic electron microscopy analysis reveals that WIN332 elicits Asn332-glycan-independent antibodies with striking sequence and binding similarities with the most potent human type-I and type-II V3-glycan bNAbs.

These traits include physiological characteristics, metabolic processes, genome properties and biotope preferences. They could be inferred to the whole bacterial community thanks to taxonomic affiliation obtained from traditional high throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing methods. This taxonomic affiliation is based on the regularly updated SILVA database and thus allows to study combinations of weighted mean trait profiles of bacterial communities at different taxonomic levels. BactoTraits can be used, for example, to improve predictions of ecological responses to natural/anthropogenic pressures and to support biomonitoring, management and conservation strategies.

High noise levels have been linked to adverse health effects, including stress, sleep disturbances, and cardiovascular issues. However, data-driven noise monitoring remains scarce in many low-resource settings, limiting efforts to develop effective mitigation strategies. To address this gap, we designed and deployed a large-scale noise data collection pipeline in Kampala and Entebbe, Uganda. Our approach integrates mobile-based tools to capture short audio recordings, categorizations of the type of noise, and sound pressure levels at specific locations. Over the course of the study, we collected 61,821 such annotated noise samples across five divisions in Kampala and four wards in Entebbe. This is to our knowledge the largest existing urban sound dataset, and the first time that the acoustic landscape of a developing-world city has been characterized in such detail. It provides valuable insights into urban noise pollution, forming a foundation for future noise mapping and mitigation efforts.",

    "Abstract": "The green energy transition has intensified global demand for critical minerals, driving the expansion of mining activities with significant environmental consequences. In response, we present a globally consistent dataset of land use and land cover classification within mining areas, providing detailed information for over 80,000 recognised mining extents across 150 countries, spanning 95,644 km² and offering global-scale insights into the mining footprint. Developed through the integration of Sentinel-2 imagery and TanDEM-X elevation change data with a Random Forest classifier, this dual-source integration supports the differentiation of functionally different but spectrally similar land use types, such as open pits and waste dumps. This distinction is critical because different land uses pose varying environmental risks. By accurately identifying specific land use types, rather than treating all disturbed or adjacent areas as equally impacted, the dataset avoids overestimating mining-affected land. Ultimately, it provides a more accurate depiction of land use within mining areas and significantly improves the reliability of environmental impact assessments in the mining sector.",

    "Abstract": "Limited streamflow observations have constrained long-term hydrological assessment and water resources management in the Amur River Basin, the largest transboundary river in Northeast Asia. To overcome this limitation, we reconstructed two monthly streamflow datasets-representing naturalized and human-influenced conditions-at 6 arcmin (~0.1°) spatial resolution for the period 1902-2022 using the Common Land Model coupled with the CaMa-Flood river routing model. Human-influenced streamflow considers major anthropogenic processes, including land use and land cover change, water withdrawals, and reservoir regulation. Evaluation against data from five major gauge stations shows satisfactory performance, with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) generally exceeding 0.50. These datasets not only capture the long-term hydroclimatic variability across the basin, but also reveal the cumulative influence of anthropogenic processes on streamflow magnitude and seasonality. These century-scale, internally consistent datasets provide new opportunities for characterizing the spatial and temporal variability of streamflow, advancing streamflow variability attribution, supporting basin-wide water resources planning, and promoting sustainable management in Northeast Asia.",

    "Abstract": "Bronchoscopy examination is essential for diagnosing and managing respiratory diseases. While Multimodality Large Language Models (MLLMs) can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of medical report writing, existing datasets lack descriptive and comprehensive annotations for complex cases, hindering their ability to facilitate adequate learning of image-report relationships. To address this problem, we introduce BERD, a Bronchoscopy Examination Report Dataset, which includes 3,692 bronchoscopy examination reports. Among these reports, 6,330 representative images are annotated with single-image text descriptions and classification labels. BERD emphasizes the provision of versatile and detailed descriptions of findings. All these reports and annotations were performed by experienced clinicians specializing in bronchoscopy. Furthermore, experimental results show that fine-tuning state-of-the-art MLLMs on BERD significantly improves their ability to generate accurate and comprehensive reports, advancing AI applications in bronchoscopy.",

    "Abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is essential for structuring knowledge in the field of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), supporting applications such as knowledge graph construction and cultural research. However, the lack of annotated datasets for ICH has limited progress in this area. To address this, we present a Chinese dataset specifically designed for NER tasks in the ICH domain, covering key entity categories such as heritage items, inheritors, and material. Additionally, we propose an NER model that integrates RoBERTa for feature representation, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for extracting complex entity patterns, and a conditional random field (CRF) for sequence labeling. Experimental results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in capturing the intricate semantic dependencies in ICH texts. The dataset and model contribute to improving entity recognition in the ICH domain, facilitating the structured representation of cultural heritage knowledge. This work provides a valuable resource for further research in information extraction, digital preservation, and cultural heritage studies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Accurately representing African ecosystems in land surface models (LSMs) remains challenging due to the limited availability and accessibility of ecological data like plant traits. We systematically classified African plant species represented in the TRY plant trait database into Plant Functional Types (PFTs) consistent with those in the JULES LSM, to enable improvements of PFT parameterization in these models. From the TRY database plant trait observations were obtained representing 2,082 plant species. We assigned classification parameters including growth form, leaf type, leaf phenology, photosynthetic pathway and climate zone using multiple sources. This delivered a sixfold increase in number of plant species that could be mapped to PFT classes from 265 to 1603 representing 137 families. It delivered a fivefold increase in the number of useable observations among the 27 traits evaluated. Our lookup table can be used to integrate existing plant trait data into PFT parameterisations in land surface models and similar large scale modelling exercises, to enhance the representation of African ecosystems and improve their capacity to simulate African ecosystems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Generative Adversarial Networks, a popular deep learning method, have achieved excellent performance in both classification and prediction tasks. However, there have been relatively few applications of generative adversarial networks to EEG data. To study the effect of high-order brain functional networks on schizophrenia patients, a high-order graph attention generative adversarial network prediction model is proposed, and the generator of the model utilizes graph attention networks and long short-term memory networks to capture the high-order topological features of persistence images for early diagnosis and prediction of schizophrenia patients. The research results on the five frequency bands of schizophrenia show that the proposed prediction model performs best in the Theta frequency band, with AUC and MAP values reaching 93.5% and 93.0%, respectively, and an average accuracy of 91.5%, both of which are superior to the selected comparison methods. Moreover, the image quality coefficient is used to quantify the realism and clarity of the images generated by the model. the image quality coefficients of schizophrenia patients were significantly correlated with the PANSS total scores in the Gamma and Theta bands, which provided a new idea for generative adversarial networks in the prediction of schizophrenia high-order topological features.",

To address the unclear propagation mechanisms and hazard characteristics of thermal runaway fires in full-scale EV battery packs, a comprehensive thermal runaway fire test on battery pack was conducted in this study. The experimental results revealed that TR propagated from individual cells to adjacent cells, ultimately engulfing the entire pack. The combustion dynamics of battery packs differed significantly from those of individual cells, exhibiting rapid fire escalation and complex combustion-explosion behaviors. A thermal radiation prediction model was established based on experimental data, according to the thermal radiation prediction model, the thermal radiation intensity of the battery pack at different distances can be obtained, so that the safe distance between various types of equipment and the electric vehicle can be determined, providing critical insights for designing safety distances and suppressing TR propagation in battery systems of EV.",

    "Abstract": "The persistent increase in healthcare expenditure has become a major challenge for the sustainability of public financing worldwide. Therefore, identifying the characteristics of at-risk population and their predictability for healthcare use is crucial to inform targeted policy and interventions to curb with increasing healthcare use and expenditure. Drawing on three waves of the HILDA survey that included a 'health module', the study applied four machine learning (ML) methods-Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and multilayer perceptron neural networks and conventional logistic regression for prediction of non-emergency healthcare use (specifically primary and tertiary inpatient hospital care). Predictive performance for the classifiers was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity measures, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Calibration of the models was assessed using Brier score, which measures the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes with lower values indicating better calibration. Finally, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) was conducted to explain the model's predictive behaviour, while SHAP results are provided for each wave along with a representative SHAP plot as a demonstration which uses the probability-contribution scale. Based on 47,899 observations and 741 variables, our model identified socio-economic factors (age, socio-economic status, private insurance status) and health-related variables (e.g. previous contact with healthcare service) and having a designated doctor to see when sick or for health advice were strong predictors of healthcare use. Between the different ML techniques, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees provided better prediction performance on healthcare use compared with logistic regression across all three waves. Although the standard logistic regression produced AUC of 0.69, had 71% positive predictive value (PPV), and 52% negative predictive value (NPV), with 86% sensitivity and 30% specificity, the ML models produced AUC in the range of 0.68 to 0.76, PPV of 75% to 77%, and NPVs of 61% to 63% with sensitivity ranging between 0.86 and 0.89, specificity between 0.40 and 0.44 and brier scores ranging between 0.11 and 0.28. The novelty of using ML techniques on a large, nationally representative longitudinal household survey data that covers a range of different domains provided more robust estimates on factors influencing future healthcare use (primary and inpatient elective care) which are important to inform resource allocation decisions and priority setting.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Bullying in school is a multidetermined phenomenon that becomes even more complex with the increasing relevance of social status at the onset of middle adolescence. This age - between 13 and 17 - is characterized by substantial social, emotional, and cognitive developments, implicating two negative social emotions in bullying behavior: envy and schadenfreude. Envy can be distinguished between benign envy, which involves improvement motivation, and malicious envy that leads to hostile feelings towards the envied person. Schadenfreude is defined as joy over the downfall of a rival. We propose that malicious envy is positively and benign envy negatively linked to bullying perpetration and that both effects are mediated by schadenfreude. In a preregistered study with a sample of n = 2,172 secondary school students, we collected data across two waves to test this proposed mediation model. Neither malicious nor benign envy is directly related to bullying; however, the effect of malicious envy on bullying perpetration is fully mediated by schadenfreude. Exploratory analyses suggest that these pathways differ by gender, indicating that in girls, malicious envy only affects bullying through schadenfreude, whereas in boys, bullying is likely influenced through other processes.",

    "Abstract": "Marine biofilms develop under the combined influence of environmental conditions and substrate properties. Among antifouling strategies, fouling-release coatings (FRCs) aim to promote the detachment of microorganisms considering their surface characteristics, offering an opportunity to examine how unfavorable adhesion conditions shape microfouling processes. Hydrophobic interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) based on tetrafluoroethyl methacrylate (TFEMA) and a commercial PDMS-based FRC were immersed for 6 months in natural seawater (Banyuls-sur-Mer, NW Mediterranean Sea), followed by exposure to moderate hydrodynamic shear stress using a rotor device. Biofilms were analyzed through a multiscale and multiomics approach combining biomass assays, microscopy, metabarcoding, and metabolomics. Community structure varied with time and substrate, but taxonomic convergence occurred during the mature stage. Notably, fungi appeared as overlooked contributors to biofilm dynamics on low-adhesion surfaces, suggesting that their roles in FRCs warrant further attention. Exposure to moderate hydrodynamic stress induced partial biomass loss while the overall community composition was largely unaffected. Metabolomic profiles further revealed coating-specific signatures, reflecting distinct physiological strategies. Together, these findings underscore how FRC surfaces modulate biofilm maturation and resilience under mechanical stress.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Herein, a novel copper-triazole derivative Schiff base nanocomplex (HIT-Cu 2+ ) was obtained via the reaction of the 3-(2-(4-amino-5-mercapto-4 H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)hydrazineylidene)indolin-2-one (HIT) Schiff base with CuCl 2 .6H 2 O. The non-ionic surfactant Triton X-114 (TX-114) was used as the extractant. The HIT, HIT-Cu 2+ , and HIT-Cu 2+ in the organic layer were characterized by several techniques, including CHNS elemental analysis, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM results revealed the formation of the HIT-Cu 2+ nanocomplex, with a particle size ranging from 13 to 25 nm. Moreover, an improved preconcentration method, named rapidly synergistic cloud point extraction (RS-CPE), was established for Cu 2+ preconcentration and determination to overcome the issues investigated in CPE. Decanol acted as a cloud point revulsant and synergistic reagent, lowering the cloud point temperature (CPT) of TX-114, so that CPE could be done at room temperature without heating. Compared with traditional CPE (about 30 min for heating, incubation and cooling), RS-CPE was accomplished in 1 min with considerably high extraction efficiency. The improved extraction technique, RS-CPE, was combined with ICP-OES to improve the analytical performance and expand the application of ICP-OES determination. Various parameters that influence the Cu 2+ removal efficiency (R, %) utilizing HIT Schiff base were investigated, including the solution’s pH and volume, the concentration of HIT and Cu 2+ , type of surfactant, TX-114 concentration, equilibrium temperature and time, interfering ions, and centrifugation time and rate. At optimum conditions, the Cu 2+ linear range, the correlation coefficient, the limit of detection (LOD), and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.5–5 µg.mL − 1 , 0.9999, 0.018, and 0.054 µg/L, respectively. The investigated RS-CPE/ICP-OES approach was applied to real water and pharmaceutical samples, achieving recoveries higher than 97% with a preconcentration factor of 125. The HIT-Cu 2+ CPE mechanism in the organic layer of TX-114 is elucidated. The greenness of the methods was evaluated using two recent methods: the Analytical Greenness (AGREE) calculator and the Blue Applicability Green Index (BAGI), which produced results in the ranges of 0.64–0.71 and 60-67.5, respectively. These results are strongly aligned with both green ideals and environmentally friendly practices. The predicted toxicity of HIT and HIT-Cu 2+ nanocomplex was evaluated using PROTOX 3 software.",

    "Abstract": "Aromaticity is a central concept in organic chemistry, traditionally evaluated through structural, magnetic, and electronic criteria. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed to systematically investigate the impact of various substituents (-H, -Me, -CH₂-CH₂-, -F, -Cl, -SiH₃, -GeH<sub>3</sub>, -NH<sub>2</sub>, -OH, -BH<sub>2</sub>, -CN) on the aromaticity of CH isomers of diazoles across four positional isomers (A-D). Aromaticity was quantified using the HOMED, BI, NICS(1), and NICS<sub>zz</sub>(1) indices, while Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis provided insights into charge distribution and second-order stabilization energies (E<sup>(2)</sup>). The results demonstrate that silyl and germyl substituents significantly enhance Schleyer-type hyperconjugative aromaticity, reflected by higher HOMED/BI values, more negative NICS indices, and stronger σ→π/π* delocalization energies in the NBO framework. In contrast, halogen substituents, particularly fluorine, diminish aromaticity, in some cases leading to near-zero or even positive NICS<sub>zz</sub> values. The π-donating substituents -NH₂ and -OH exert only modest effects on aromaticity, whereas the π-accepting -CN group generally suppresses aromatic stabilization. In contrast, the -BH₂ substituent behaves as an efficient σ-donor, significantly enhancing aromaticity, comparable to those observed for -SiH<sub>3</sub> and -GeH<sub>3</sub> derivatives. Strong correlations were observed between NICS and NICS<sub>zz</sub>, as well as between NICS and E<sup>(2)</sup>, confirming the direct relationship between ring currents and hyperconjugative stabilization. This comprehensive multicriteria approach highlights the crucial role of substituents and positional isomers in governing hyperconjugative aromaticity in CH tautomer of diazole scaffolds and provides new insights into the electronic origin of this phenomenon.",

    "Abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance has become a serious global issue, because these microbes produce beta-Lactamase that degrades antibiotics. To overcome this issue, worldwide researchers have focused on nanoparticles. It is because of their unique chemical and biological properties and their use as an antimicrobial and larvicidal agent to get rid of infectious and vector-borne diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to synthesize zinc oxide nanoparticles using Acorn fruit as a novel and phytochemical-rich plant and evaluated their antimicrobial and larvicide potentials. These ZnO NPs synthesis were confirmed by Visual observation of color change from yellowish to dark brown and UV visible analysis. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of prepared nanoparticles revealed a sharp peak at 600-450 cm<sup>- 1</sup> indicating the presence of Zn-O stretching vibration. The prominent, sharp peaks in the X-ray diffraction pattern verified the crystalline structure of ZnO NPs. With scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ZnO nanoparticles exhibiting a tiny size indicated good surface morphology. In biological activities these ZnO NPs revealed outstanding antibacterial efficacy against E. coli (minimum zone of inhibition 15 ± 02 mm at 10 µg/ml and maximum 24 ± 05 mm at 80 µg/ml) and S.aureus (minimum zone of inhibition 17 ± 03 mm at 10 µg/ml and 26 ± 02 mm at 80 µg/ml). In the in-silico analysis, these nanoparticles demonstrated a considerable interaction with the Beta-Lactamase binding site residues with a docking score of -8.2 kcal/mol. It confirms the successful inhibition of the given enzyme, which catalyzes a lot of antibiotics. Thus, these nanoparticles combated microbes by blocking their resistive enzyme, which is the novel property of these ZnO NPs. Furthermore, these ZnO NPs showed high mortality rates against the Culex quinquefasciatus larvae and the LC 50 and LC 90 values were found as 13.6 ppm and 45 ppm respectively. In histopathological observation, they found that these nanoparticles caused microvilli destruction. It also initiated mid-gut columnar cell vacuolization, passage of epithelial cell contents into the mid-gut lumen and ultimately cell death. Hence, the above findings propose that the synthesized ZnO NPs may be used for various environmental and anti-pathogenic applications.",

While self-efficacy and quality of life (QOL) are known to influence mental health outcomes (depression and suicidal ideation) in clinical populations, their roles in VSS remain unexplored. This study aimed to examine the associations among VSS, self-efficacy, QOL, mental health outcomes and the potential serial mediation roles of self-efficacy and QOL. A cross-sectional study compared 64 VSS patients and 67 healthy controls matched with age, sex and education level. Participants completed validated questionnaires assessing self-efficacy (GSES), QOL (WHOQOL-BREF), depression (CES-D), and suicidal ideation (BSSI, first five items). Analyses included group comparisons, correlation analyses to examine variable relationships, multimodel linear regression and serial mediation modeling to test the hypothesized sequential pathway from VSS through self-efficacy and quality of life to mental health outcomes. Compared with controls, VSS patients demonstrated significantly lower self-efficacy (VSS: 23.6 ± 6.2; Controls: 30.6 ± 6.0; p &lt; 0.001) and QOL (VSS: 62.5 ± 9.5; Controls: 73.6 ± 8.8; p &lt; 0.001), alongside elevated depression (median [IQR]: VSS: 28 [21,34]; Controls: 11 [7, 15]; p &lt; 0.001) and suicidal ideation (VSS: 6 [5, 7]; Controls: 5 [5,6]; p &lt; 0.01). Serial mediation analysis revealed that the effects of VSS on depression and suicidal ideation were mediated through self-efficacy and QOL sequentially. The total indirect effect for depression was 7.73 (95% CI [5.64–9.85]), with QOL accounting for 49.09% of the total effect. For suicidal ideation, the total indirect effect was 0.80 (95% CI [0.39–1.22]). Lower self-efficacy and QOL appear to serially mediate the associations between VSS and mental health impairments. These preliminary, cross-sectional findings indicate that self-efficacy and QOL may serve as modifiable intervention targets that mediate or moderate the risk of depression and suicidal ideation in individuals with VSS. Clinicians should prioritize routine assessments of these factors to guide early intervention strategies, although longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these causal pathways.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study aims to evaluate and compare cardiac autonomic function, specifically through heart rate variability (HRV), between individuals with bronchiectasis and their age- and gender-matched healthy counterparts. This study employed a case-control design, involving 60 participants diagnosed with bronchiectasis (cases) and a control group of healthy individuals matched by age and gender. HRV data was collected over a five-minute interval, focusing on frequency domain parameters including total power, very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and the LF/HF ratio. The bronchiectasis group exhibited a significantly elevated LF/HF ratio, indicating a shift in cardiac sympathovagal balance, relative to the control group (2.25 ± 0.39 vs. 2.05 ± 0.38; p = 0.006). Additionally, marked differences were found in specific frequency domain parameters: LF (2.33 ± 0.55 vs. 2.55 ± 0.46; p = 0.021) and HF (2.06 ± 0.75 vs. 2.5 ± 0.56; p = 0.001). The results suggest a notable disturbance in cardiac autonomic regulation among individuals with bronchiectasis, compared to healthy individuals.",

    "Abstract": "Auditory events occurring in the peripersonal space (PPS) or near specific body parts such as the peritrunk (PTS) and perihand (PHS) space, have been shown to facilitate tactile processing in a somatotopic manner. Furthermore, previous research has demonstrated that audio-tactile intersensory effects are influenced by the execution of full body transport movements (i.e., walking or cycling), so that far-off auditory stimuli that approach the body in a direction coherent with the movement facilitate tactile processing on the body. However, whether these motor-related intersensory effects are modulated by non-transport movements is not known. Here, in two experiments, we sought to determine whether audio-tactile intersensory effects for looming sounds in the PHS and PTS are somatotopically modulated by arm movement compared to when being still. By controlling the role of temporal expectation, we confirm that looming sounds enhance tactile reactivity as they approach the participants' hand and trunk. We further show that this facilitation is eliminated by limb movements, regardless of somatotopy, and that executing movements blur the distinction between intersensory effects in extrapersonal and peripersonal space. These results contribute to understanding the complex relation between motor execution and intersensory processing.",

    "Abstract": "This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for conducting time-dependent system reliability analysis of foundation situated above cavity. It leverages advanced techniques, including Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost) regression and Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS), to assess the stability and performance of these foundations while considering uncertainties in various parameters. The core of this study involves the development of surrogate models using XGBoost regression to predict critical foundation response variables, viz., bearing capacity (BC) and settlement. These models incorporate variability through the use of the bootstrapping technique. The XGBoost regression models demonstrate superior predictive accuracy, boasting R<sup>2</sup> values of 0.97 for BC and 0.86 for settlement, and thus effectively capturing complex data relationships. To deal with non-normally distributed data, the study employs a robust log transformation approach with bootstrapping, ensuring the generation of reliable results suitable for analysis. The foundation's performance is rigorously assessed against BC and settlement criteria, both individually and as a system. A notable finding is the 29.62% increase in the probability of failure while transitioning from BC to settlement criteria, and an amplified change of 55.74% was observed for system reliability. This underscores the paramount importance of system reliability assessment. In addition, a time-dependent reliability sensitivity analysis is performed by introducing controlled temporal variations in BC and settlement, revealing a progressive reduction in reliability indices with time.",

    "Abstract": "Laser osteotomy offers high precision and contact-free bone cutting but remains limited by slower cutting speeds and shallower ablation depths compared to mechanical tools. In this study, we systematically investigated the influence of spatial beam intensity distribution on bone ablation performance by comparing Er:YAG laser with tophat and Gaussian intensity distribution under identical operating conditions. Using bovine femur cortical bone and optimized water-air cooling, the tophat intensity distribution achieved a maximum ablation depth of 44.51 mm and a maximum average material removal rate of 0.42 mm[Formula: see text]/s, outperforming the Gaussian intensity distribution (26.51 mm, 0.24 mm[Formula: see text]/s). In dry surface ablation, the tophat profile reached 1.58 mm[Formula: see text]/s±0.04 mm[Formula: see text]/s, though with increased carbonization. Compared to previously reported Er:YAG outcomes under optimized ablation conditions, the cutting depth achieved in this work represents more than a twofold improvement, bringing performance close to the planar cut dimensions required during distal femur resurfacing of a total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Scanning electron microscopy and Raman analyzes confirmed minimal compositional change after laser ablation, indicating minimal thermal damage. A steady-state model was utilized to characterize the ablation process and determine the theoretical maximum ablation depth. These findings demonstrate clear ex vivo improvements by using a tophat profile in Er:YAG systems, which have the potential for clinical adoption.",

We present a novel framework integrating post-quantum cryptography (PQC) with zero trust architecture (ZTA), formally grounded in category theory to secure AI model access. Our approach uniquely models cryptographic workflows as morphisms and trust policies as functors. This enables fine-grained, adaptive trust and micro-segmentation for lattice-based PQC primitives, offering enhanced protection against adversarial AI threats. We demonstrate efficacy through a concrete ESP32 implementation, validating crypto-agile transition with quantifiable improvements. Category theory provides rigorous proofs for AI security. Our implementation achieves significant memory efficiency: the agent uses 91.86% and the broker 97.88% of free heap after cryptographic operations.

An extreme rainfall event triggered devastating landslides and widespread damage over Wayanad in the Western Ghats, India, during 29-30 July 2024. This study investigates the MCC responsible for the event using satellite, in-situ, and reanalysis datasets. The system exhibited deep organized convection, strong low-level moisture transport, and upper-level divergence within a highly unstable atmospheric environment. An anomalously persistent warm pool over the southeastern Arabian Sea, sustained during a monsoon break phase, created favorable thermodynamic conditions through elevated sea surface temperatures and latent heat fluxes. The findings underscore the growing role of ocean-atmosphere coupling in monsoonal convective extremes and highlight the need for improved mesoscale modeling and early warning frameworks over topographically complex regions like the Western Ghats.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The deployment of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks is transforming digital connectivity through ultra-low latency, high data rates, and massive device support. However, enabling technologies such as network slicing, virtualization, edge computing, and dense Internet of Things (IoT) integration significantly expand the attack surface, necessitating advanced cybersecurity strategies. This study proposes a comprehensive multi-layered cybersecurity framework tailored for 5G infrastructures. The framework incorporates device-level trust validation, secure network slice configuration and isolation, dynamic policy enforcement at the orchestration layer, and AI-driven threat detection to provide end-to-end protection across the 5G architecture. Unlike traditional reactive security models, the proposed approach adopts security-by-design principles to proactively mitigate threats. The framework’s effectiveness is evaluated through extensive simulations and benchmarking against established standards, including the NIST Zero Trust Architecture and 3GPP TS 33.501. Results demonstrate a threat detection rate of up to 97.6%, low-latency performance under high-load and adversarial conditions, and scalable operation with large-scale device connectivity. Despite these results, challenges remain in ensuring consistent policy enforcement across distributed edge nodes, achieving interoperability among heterogeneous devices, and balancing performance with stringent security requirements. The study concludes by highlighting future research directions, including quantum-resilient cryptography and self-healing, AI-enhanced security mechanisms, to address evolving threats in future 6G networks.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents the development of an innovative biomarker detection technology based on NV centres. In order to provide initial proofs of concept for the technique, we applied this detection technique to Lateral Flow Assays (LFA) through the use of NV-doped functionalised nanodiamonds (ND) as LFA labels. The remarkable properties of NV centres in diamond enable a sensitive and quantitative detection of biomarkers with an LFA label that is robust to external perturbation, easy to handle and functionalisable for a wide range of targets. The aim of NV-based LFA is to combine the advantages of the most widely used LFA - i.e. high speed, simplicity and low cost - with quantitative and highly sensitive measurements in a large detection range, from pg/mL limit of detection to mg/mL. Such detection could be of great interest in a variety of applications where simple but sensitive detection is required, for e.g. biomedical, agri-food or ecotoxicology diagnostics. NV-doped nanodiamonds have already shown promise as alternative labels in LFA, yet lack quantitative comparison with conventional markers. This study addresses this gap by validating an NV-based LFA setup for cancer antigen detection and providing a first experimental comparison with standard LFA labels.",

    "Abstract": "Despite growing interest in online health communities (OHCs), prior studies report inconsistent findings regarding the factors that drive users' continuous engagement. Furthermore, little is known about the relative importance of these factors and their hierarchical interactions. To address these gaps, this study poses two research questions: What are the key determinants of continuous OHC usage, and how do these determinants interact within a hierarchical structure? We conducted a meta-analysis of empirical studies to extract 16 critical factors, and applied the FUZZY-DEMATEL-AISM method to construct a multi-layered framework capturing their interrelationships. The findings reveal that attitude functions as the most direct top-level determinant, while trust, perceived value, and self-efficacy serve as transitional drivers. In contrast, system quality, service quality, and technology anxiety form the foundational layer influencing user behavior. This study contributes to theory by elucidating the structural logic underlying OHC engagement and to practice by providing actionable insights for enhancing user retention and optimizing digital health platform design. The results offer a systematic roadmap for researchers and practitioners aiming to understand and improve sustained user participation in digital health communities.",

Climate change is also one of the major constraints that hampers crop productivity. This study aims to analyze the current and future impacts of climate change on agricultural production using current data and the latest climate change scenarios. Panel data from the fourth (2018/19) and fifth (2021/22) waves of the Ethiopian Socioeconomic Survey were utilized. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources and the World Climate Research Program websites served as the main sources of historical and simulated climate data. The Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model, Community Earth System Model version 2, the Meteorological Research Institute Earth System Model version 2.0, and Medium-resolution version of the Norwegian Earth System Model version 2 Global Circulation Models were employed to get the simulated climate data from 2015 to 2100 in Ethiopia under four different scenarios. The output from the Ricardian model indicates that annual temperature has a statistically significant negative impact on both current and future crop production in Ethiopia, while annual precipitation has a positive impact. The study also reveals that current and future climate change has a heterogeneous impact on various types of agro-ecologies, while exhibiting a homogeneous impact on six major cereal crops. Therefore, policymakers should design appropriate climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies to reduce both the causes and effects of climate change, respectively.",

    "Abstract": "Acute renal failure (ARF) is one of the most common conditions encountered in the intensive care unit (ICU). ARF has a complex pathogenesis and due to the progressive weakening of the structure and function of the kidney, the incidence of ARF increases significantly in the aging group. Therefore, the development of reliable predictive model is of great importance to identify those patients in high risk for ARF, in order to provide timely and effective interventions to improve their prognosis. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is an efficient integrated learning algorithm with advantages over traditional logistic regression (LR) methods. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the two models in predicting 90-day mortality in elderly patients with ARF. Data of elderly patients (> 60years) with ARF in ICU were extracted from MIMIC IV with 90-day mortality as end-point. The performance of the two predictive models was tested and compared by receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). Cumulative residual distribution plot and residual box-plot were then used to determine the fit of the model. Finally, the model with better overall diagnostic value was selected and a breakdown plot was drawn. Data of 7,500 elderly ARF patients were analyzed, of whom 1,150 died within 90 days. Both models showed good discriminatory ability, but the XGBoost model had a larger area under the curve value. DCA results revealed that the net benefit of the XGBoost model had a greater range than the LR model. Moreover, the XGBoost model had the smallest sample residuals and root-mean-square residuals, indicating a better fitting of the XGBoost algorithm. Finally, a breakdown plot based on the XGBoost model was created as an individualized tool for prognosis prediction in elderly patients with ARF. Our study find that the XGBoost algorithm model was a better model for predicting 90-day mortality in elderly ICU patients with ARF compared to the LR model. The model may have clinical applications for elderly patients with ARF and may help healthcare professionals to develop detailed treatment plans as well as provide accurate care.",

    "Abstract": "Since modern rural development results from a complex interaction between various exogenous forces, the sustainable development of rural communities in ecologically fragile areas is inherently a systemic endeavor. This study, guided by the social-ecological system theory, examines the impact of social, economic, political, natural, and other external factors on the sustainable development of rural communities in these areas. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of delayed development in these communities. The results are as follows: First, labor outflow, ecological fragility, and informal institutions significantly hinder the sustainable development of rural communities, while regional economic development demonstrates a strong positive relationship with the sustainability of rural communities. Second, regional economic development primarily influences the sustainability of communities through its impact on locational conditions. Communities closer to the county and town experience a more pronounced positive effect from regional economic development. Thirdly, informal institutions inhibit the sustainable development of rural communities by obstructing the land rights reform process. Finally, for small-scale communities, the inhibitory effect of ecological fragility and the facilitating effects of regional economic development are more substantial, while labor outflow and informal institutions exert a pronounced inhibitory effect primarily on large-scale communities. For low-poverty communities, labor outflow exerts a more significant inhibitory effect on community sustainability. In contrast, for high-poverty communities, the regional economic development contributes more significantly to sustainability, while ecological fragility and informal institutions have a stronger inhibitory effect.",

In recent years, precision beekeeping has emerged as a promising approach to support hive management through sensor-based monitoring. However, existing systems often lack predictive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in anticipating disruptive events that threaten colony health. To address this gap, we present BeeViz, an intelligent monitoring system that combines time series forecasting and anomaly detection to enhance decision-making in apiculture. The system integrates sensor networks, cloud infrastructure, and AI-based data processing modules to continuously track key hive parameters (temperature, humidity, and weight) and generate short-term forecasts and real-time alerts. Preliminary results show that the system can effectively detect anomalies and generate short-term forecasts for key hive parameters, with promising accuracy across different metrics. By enabling proactive interventions, BeeViz supports more resilient and sustainable beekeeping practices, paving the way for collaborative learning and data-driven hive management.",

    "Abstract": "As modernization and industrialization continue to accelerate, air pollution has become an increasingly pressing problem. Air quality prediction is considered an essential technical support for air pollution prevention and control. To achieve more accurate predictions for urban air pollution, we propose a hybrid model called CBLA, which consists of three parts: one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNNs), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network (BiLSTM), and attention mechanism. Firstly, 1D-CNNs extract the deep features of the original data. Secondly, BiLSTM mines time-series features for initial prediction. Finally, the attention mechanism captures the effect of characteristic conditions on PM2.5 concentration at different times to further optimize the model. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoosting) tree is used to integrate the preliminary prediction results and meteorological data to improve prediction accuracy further. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations using Beijing's air quality and meteorological datasets, which showed that the CBLA model has excellent performance and model expression power.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Acute metabolic acidosis (MA), a feature mostly associated with chronic kidney disease, decreases glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. By contrast, the effects of chronic MA on glucose homeostasis remain elusive. Here, we evaluated glucose homeostasis and metabolic parameters in male mice exhibiting chronic MA via long-term NH 4 Cl administration. Unlike acute MA, chronic MA resulted in lower body weight, increased energy expenditure, lower basal glycemia, improved glucose tolerance without changes in insulin secretion or sensitivity. No overall glucose uptake changes were observed. However, hepatic and intestinal gluconeogenesis were decreased whereas renal endogenous glucose production was increased in mice with chronic MA. The elevated glucose urinary excretion was associated with lower expression of renal sodium/glucose co-transporters. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that chronic MA potentiates anion transport, glucose and lipid metabolism, mitochondrial and oxidative phosphorylation pathways in the kidney. Overall, chronic MA improves glucose tolerance without changes in insulin secretion or sensitivity, likely due to reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis, decreased renal glucose reabsorption and increased energy demands in the kidney.",

    "Abstract": "A critical challenge in swarm intelligence is the effective utilization of knowledge gained during the search, a process often confounded by the risk of negative knowledge transfer. To address this, we introduce the Learning-Aided Artificial Bee Colony (LA-ABC), a novel framework guided by a Neural Knowledge Transfer mechanism for global optimization. Our framework establishes a co-evolutionary mechanism between the search process of the ABC algorithm and an online neural knowledge learning engine. LA-ABC operates on a dual-pathway architecture, probabilistically arbitrating between foundational swarm exploration and a knowledge-transfer pathway. In this second pathway, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) learns a predictive, non-linear model from a dynamic archive of historically successful solutions. This approach enables the model to interpret the complex context of successful moves, thereby preventing the negative knowledge transfer where a beneficial pattern in one region of the search space could be detrimental in another. This learned intelligence is then operationalized through a generative operator that transfers validated positive knowledge to create high-quality candidate solutions. The process transforms the ABC from a memoryless explorer into an intelligent agent that learns to navigate the fitness landscape with high efficacy. The superiority of the LA-ABC framework is demonstrated through comprehensive benchmarking on 23 standard test functions, the competitive IEEE CEC 2019 suite, and a real-world photovoltaic parameter extraction problem. Our proposed neural knowledge transfer approach significantly outperforms 12 state-of-the-art algorithms, including ABC, L-SHADE, JSO, L-DE, L-PSO, KL-variants, and RL variants with the significance of these improvements validated by rigorous statistical tests (Wilcoxon, Bonferroni-Dunn, Friedman, and ANOVA). Ultimately, LA-ABC provides a robust new paradigm for integrating reinforcement learning and knowledge transfer within evolutionary computation.",

    "Abstract": "Humans exposed to cold environments for leisure or occupational activities may experience cold stress. Cold-related physical and mental stress can negatively affect cognitive performance. A recent literature review has pointed out that a single acute exposure to cold under controlled laboratory conditions (e.g., cold air or cold water) induces cognitive impairment with attention, processing speed, memory, and executive function being the most affected cognitive domains. Males and females seem to respond differently to short-term cold exposure, although results are not consistent. The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of acute and brief (15 min) exposure to low ambient temperatures of -10 °C compared with 5 °C and 20 °C on selected cognitive performance (reaction time, processing speed, and risky decision-making). We hypothesized that cognitive performance decreases at low temperatures with a sex difference, before core temperature changes. This randomized, controlled, crossover study was conducted in an environmental chamber (terraXcube) under controlled, replicable, and safe conditions in twenty-four healthy volunteers, females and males, aged between 18 and 60 years. Measurements included Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT), Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), and Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). Cognitive performance, stress, and cold were subjectively rated with a visual analogue scale (VAS). Physiological data (including core and skin temperatures) were continuously recorded with a physiological monitoring system. Data were analysed using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), Friedman test, Generalised Estimating Equations (GEE), and correlation analysis. We identified transient impairments in cognitive performance in individuals wearing appropriate clothing. Cold exposure (-10 °C) affected attention by slowing response times and increasing the lapses, and decision-making by reducing risky behaviour. Heart rate, cold sensation, and stress, as well as thermal sensation and comfort, but not core temperature were different in the three experimental temperature exposures. No differences were found between male and female subjects in their cognitive performance. Our data support the distraction theory in the decline of cognitive performance even during a short exposure to cold temperatures. Such impairment should be carefully considered in people performing different activities in cold environments, even for a short time.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Intracranial germ cell tumors (iGCTs) are rare, histologically classified as extragonadal germ cell tumors, and predominantly affect children and adolescents. These tumors are commonly found in the midline of the brain, with a notable male predominance and varying geographic incidences. The origins of iGCTs have been debated, particularly whether they arise from abnormal migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) or transformed embryonic stem cells (ESCs). In this study, we hypothesize the potential presence of PGC-like cells in the pituitary gland, and these cells may differentiate into iGCTs during the complex and frequent regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary–gonadal axis (HPGA).We analyzed the expression of four germ cell markers—MVH, OCT4, C-kit, and PLZF—using immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time quantitative PCR in human pituitary tissues, pituitary tumors, and pituitary germ cell tumors. Our findings indicate significant expression of these markers in pituitary tissues, with the highest levels found in pituitary germ cell tumors. These results support the existence of PGC-like cells that within the normal pituitary gland. This study provides new insights into the cellular origins of iGCTs and suggests further investigation into the regulatory mechanisms that may lead to tumorigenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Obinutuzumab (OBI), a type II glycoengineered anti-CD20 antibody, induces direct cell death (DCD) in B-cell lymphomas more effectively than rituximab, yet the upstream mechanisms underlying this activity remain unclear. Here, we identify a lipid-ion channel axis linking antibody internalization to lysosomal destabilization. Using imaging, genetic, and biochemical approaches, we show that OBI is rapidly internalized into acidic compartments where it colocalizes with sphingomyelin (SM). SM-dependent inhibition of TRPML2-mediated lysosomal Ca<sup>2</sup>⁺ release sensitizes lysosomes to OBI-induced stress, lowering the threshold for LMP and direct cell death. Restoration of TRPML2 function by SMase treatment, or blockade of OBI internalization, attenuates LMP and DCD, underscoring the critical role of the SM-TRPML2 pathway. These findings reveal a previously uncharacterized mechanism by which OBI exerts cytotoxicity, highlighting lipid remodeling and ion channel regulation as potential targets to enhance the efficacy of antibody-based therapies in B-cell malignancies.",

    "Abstract": "Self-healing hydrogels are advanced materials that can restore their original functionality and properties after mechanical damage, either through intrinsic mechanisms or via external stimuli. However, their widespread application is often limited by challenges such as insufficient mechanical strength, low thermal stability, and inadequate self-healing efficiency. In this study, we developed a novel self-healing hydrogel based on salep. This natural polysaccharide was modified through free radical polymerization using two distinct polymers: polyacrylamide (PAM) and poly)diallyldimethylammonium( chloride (PDADMAC). Additionally, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesized and incorporated into the hydrogel matrix, imparting magnetic responsiveness. The resulting semi-interpenetrating (semi-IPN) hydrogel network exhibited robust self-healing properties, attributed to dynamic, reversible hydrogen bonds within the polymer chains. The inclusion of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> MNPs further facilitated the mobility of polymer chains under an external magnetic field, significantly improving the efficiency and rate of self-repair. The PAM-modified nanocomposite hydrogel achieved an equilibrium swelling ratio of ~ 2300%, while the PDADMAC-based composite reached ~ 1875% at pH = 7. Notably, the semi-IPN structure endowed the hydrogel with self-healing, enabling it to recover its original mechanical integrity within 35 min at room temperature. Combining a natural salep matrix with synthetic polymer networks and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> MNPs produced a self-healing hydrogel with markedly improved strength, stability, and functionality. The dynamic hydrogen-bonded network ensures rapid, autonomous repair, while the magnetic component provides tunable responsiveness under external fields. These features, together with High tensile properties and antimicrobial efficacy, suggest broad applicability in biomedical, agricultural, and environmental technologies.",

    "Abstract": "The multimedia communication and image-sharing platform development has increased exponentially, which enhances the threat of unauthorized entry, degradation through compression, and the manipulation of the visual data. The classical watermarking methods that are based on fixed-domain transforms are likely DCT and DWT are not always adaptive to different compression rates, and do not have high robustness to adversarial environments. In addition, methods that are available are limited by low levels of imperceptibility or computation, which hinder real time or large-scale application. In order to overcome such limitations, a new Quantum-Optimized Hierarchical Chunk Encoding (QHCE) model of perceptually adaptive and compression-sensitive image watermarking is proposed. The offered approach incorporates the entropy-based quadtree partitioning of the image into chunks, saliency-based region selection, and transform-domain embedding of watermark with the use of multi-layers DWT. Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA) is used to find the optimal location, band and strength of the embedding parameter that results in a good trade-off between the robustness and the visual fidelity. The model was trained with Python 3.10 and PyWavelets and Qiskit and tested on Kodak image dataset at different JPEG compression ratios. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement over baseline methods, with an average PSNR of 57.8 dB, SSIM of 0.997, 0.00% BER, and 100% extraction accuracy at QF ≥ 70. The QGA-based optimization also achieved a 19% increase in payload capacity and a 25% reduction in runtime compared to non-optimized baselines. Integrity verification reached 99.95% accuracy using SHA-256 and Hamming distance analysis. Integrating quantum-inspired optimization within a perceptually driven encoding pipeline offers a scalable, secure, and highly robust solution for next-generation visual data protection. This provides a compelling direction for future research in quantum-secure multimedia systems and watermark resilience.",

    "Abstract": "Infrared and visible light image fusion is a hot topic in the field of image processing, aiming to merge the complementary information from source images to produce a fusion image containing richer information. However, the images used for fusion are often taken under extreme lighting conditions at night, which greatly affects the quality of the visible light images-specifically causing low-light degradation phenomena such as uneven brightness, severe noise amplification, and loss of texture details-and leads to poor fusion results; most existing image fusion algorithms do not take into account the lighting factor. For this reason, we propose a multi-scale end-to-end image enhancement fusion method that enhances the illumination of the image while realizing image fusion, which greatly improves the quality of the fused image. The model is based on the existing autoencoder fusion network design, which includes four parts: visible image encoder, infrared image encoder, decoder and fusion module, and the training is accomplished by a novel three-stage training strategy. In the first stage the visible image enhancement consisting of visible image encoder and decoder is trained, and in the second stage the autoencoder consisting of infrared image encoder and decoder is trained. The fusion module is then trained in the third stage. This staged training strategy not only ensures effective learning of each component, but also provides more accurate and robust performance for image fusion in complex environments. Experimental results on public domain datasets show that our end-to-end fusion network achieves superior visual performance results compared to existing methods.",

    "Abstract": "Water scarcity is one of the most critical constraints in arid and semi-arid regions, directly limiting plant growth, yield, and quality through its effects on physiological and biochemical processes. In Iran, where most areas experience arid or semi-arid conditions, enhancing crop resilience to drought is a pressing need. Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.), a medicinal and nutritionally valuable cucurbit, is particularly sensitive to water deficits. This study evaluated the effects of foliar-applied potassium (K), zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), and silicon (Si) on vegetative growth, physiological responses, and nutrient accumulation under drought stress. The experiment followed a factorial design with two factors: foliar treatments (Zn, K, Ca, Si) and drought stress levels (50%, 75%, and 100% field capacity, FC) with five repetitions. Drought stress increased ion leakage and reduced relative water content (RWC), especially at 50% FC, while Ca and Si effectively alleviated these effects. Si-treated plants showed the highest RWC at 100% FC, whereas Ca was most effective at 75% FC. Chlorophyll and carotenoid levels declined under drought; however, Si and Zn preserved chlorophylls, and Ca and Si enhanced carotenoids. Photosystem II performance was maintained by K and Ca, with Si showing particular benefits at 50% FC. Biochemical adjustments included greater carbohydrate and proline accumulation, stimulated mainly by K and Si, while Ca and Si enhanced phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Ca was most effective in sustaining ascorbic acid and peroxidase activity, while Si and K improved catalase activity. Growth and yield traits declined significantly under drought but were best preserved by Ca, followed by K and Si, with Zn showing limited benefits. Nutrient uptake (Ca, Mg, K) in roots and shoots improved under Ca and K treatments, with Si contributing under severe stress. Overall, Ca emerged as the most versatile element, Si excelled under severe drought, and K supported osmotic and photosynthetic functions.",

The system dynamics are assumed to be completely unknown, and only the measured outputs and the applied control inputs are used for system identification. Accordingly, the system is treated as a black-box model. The proposed control framework consists of three integrated subsystems. The first subsystem incorporates a Type-3 fuzzy logic system to model the unknown nonlinear dynamics, in conjunction with a model predictive controller and an adaptive stabilizing unit. The second subsystem is dedicated to sensor fault diagnosis and compensation, employing two Type-3 fuzzy estimators and a supervisory module that generates a corrective signal proportional to the magnitude of the actual sensor fault. The third subsystem constitutes a virtual structure composed of a virtual sensor, a virtual actuator, a Type-3 fuzzy identifier, a virtual model predictive controller, a virtual fault detection unit, an internal adaptive compensator, and a supervisory mechanism.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Autologous stem-cell transplantation is a fundamental therapy for multiple myeloma. Although inpatient chemo-based stem-cell mobilization (SCM) is standard care in Germany, outpatient approaches could ease healthcare constraints. We analyzed 109 myeloma patients undergoing SCM and collection at the University Medical Center Göttingen for safety. We then trained machine learning models to predict adverse events (AEs) requiring hospitalization and to forecast AE onset timing for optimized ward management. In our cohort, 97% achieved successful collection, but 69% experienced severe AEs necessitating hospitalization. Simulations suggest a risk-stratified outpatient protocol could cut bed usage by at least one third without compromising safety. Classification models accurately predicted some AE types (e.g., elevated creatinine, ROC-AUC 1.0), though neutropenic fever remained challenging (ROC-AUC 0.67). Regression models forecast AE onset with a mean error of just over one day. These results outline a data-driven roadmap for safely adopting outpatient SCM and optimizing resource allocation in clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "Many physicochemical properties in the cellular milieu are important for cell function and survival. However, the polarity of different subcellular compartments and its role in protein condensate and aggregate formation within cells are less characterized. Here, we develop a method to compare the polarity in different subcellular compartments using the same polarity-sensitive solvatochromic fluorescent probe. Unexpectedly, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen displays a higher polarity and a more crowded environment than the cytosol in human cells. Polarity-decreasing and crowding-increasing hypertonic conditions induce condensate or aggregate formation of two intrinsically disordered proteins, with-no-lysine kinase 1 and Huntingtin gene (Htt) exon1 with an expanded polyQ stretch (Htt-polyQ), in the cytosol. However, targeting Htt-polyQ to the ER prevents its aggregation, suggesting that polarity but not crowding is more relevant to protein aggregation. Our results reveal the heterogeneity in subcellular polarity and crowding, and uncover previously unrecognized high-polarity in the ER lumen, which provides a unique environment for maintaining robust proteostasis.",

    "Abstract": "Liver fibrosis is a major global health burden with limited treatment options. Transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBI) is crucial in fibrotic diseases and tumors, however, its precise mechanism in liver fibrosis remains unclear. Here we show that TGFBI promotes liver fibrosis in male C57BL/6 mice. TGFBI is upregulated in fibrotic livers and derived from non-parenchymal cells. Genetic TGFBI deficiency alleviates liver fibrosis in both CCl<sub>4</sub> (carbon tetrachloride) injection and bile duct ligation (BDL) models. Mechanistically, PDGFRβ is identified via RNA sequencing as a key downstream molecule upregulated by TGFBI in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) via the integrin αvβ3-FAK-STAT3 pathway, promoting HSC proliferation and activation. Meanwhile, TGFBI increases PDGF-B expression in macrophages through the integrin αvβ3-AKT-ERK pathway, driving their proliferation, migration and differentiation into the profibrotic TREM2<sup>+</sup>CD9<sup>+</sup> subpopulation. Elevated PDGF-B reversely stimulates TGFBI production in macrophages, which creates a positive feedback loop. This TGFBI-mediated interaction between HSCs and macrophages remodels the profibrotic microenvironment to promote liver fibrosis, identifying a potential therapeutic target.",

    "Abstract": "RegIIIα is an antibacterial protein primarily operating in the digestive tract to defend against bacterial infection through direct bactericidal activity. A previous study proposed that RegIIIα forms hexameric pores on the membrane of Gram-positive bacteria, leading to cell lysis. These RegIIIα hexamers can further assemble into filaments, diminishing RegIIIα activity. However, the high-resolution structure of RegIIIα assembly remains elusive, impeding the comprehension of the molecular mechanisms underlying RegIIIα function. In this study, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of RegIIIα filaments formed in vitro at a resolution of 2.2 Å. Our structure reveals a similar subunit arrangement but a distinct subunit orientation compared to the previously reported low-resolution model of RegIIIα filaments. Through structural analysis and biochemical assays, we identified two essential interfaces for RegIIIα assembly, offered a potential explanation for the necessity of lipids in RegIIIα assembly, and elucidated the inhibitory mechanism of the pro-segment of RegIIIα. Collectively, our study presents the first near-atomic structure of filaments formed by C-tyle lectin containing proteins, providing structural insights into RegIIIα assembly that are closely related to its physiological functions and regulations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Phase-retrieval from coded diffraction patterns (CDP) is important to X-ray crystallography, diffraction tomography and astronomical imaging, yet remains a hard, non-convex inverse problem. We show that CDP recovery can be reformulated exactly as the minimization of a continuous-variable XY Hamiltonian and solved by gain-based photonic networks. The coupled-mode equations we exploit are the natural mean-field dynamics of exciton-polariton condensate lattices, coupled-laser arrays and driven photon Bose-Einstein condensates, while other hardware such as the spatial photonic Ising machine can implement the same update rule through high-speed digital feedback, preserving full optical parallelism. Numerical experiments on images, two- and three-dimensional vortices and unstructured complex data demonstrate that the gain-based solver consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Relaxed-Reflect-Reflect (RRR) algorithm in the medium-noise regime (signal-to-noise ratios 10-40 dB) and retains this advantage as problem size scales. Because the physical platform performs the continuous optimisation, our approach promises fast, energy-efficient phase retrieval on readily available photonic hardware.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Since about 2000, the total mass of the Antarctic Ice Sheet has declined at a near-linear rate, increasing global sea levels. Since 2016, however, satellite gravimetry data reveal a slowdown in net Antarctic ice mass loss and a net mass gain since 2020, despite increases in dynamically-driven ice loss by discharge from outlet glaciers. Here we use a reanalysis and regional climate model to show that this reversal is primarily due to positive surface mass balance anomalies, which result from increased precipitation driven by enhanced atmospheric river activity, strengthened westerlies, and reduced sea ice extent. Atmospheric rivers have become more frequent and intense since 2020, particularly over the Antarctic Peninsula, Queen Maud Land, and Wilkes Land, resulting in strong regional positive mass balance anomalies. High-resolution regional climate model simulations with modified sea ice extent show that the effect of sea ice loss on enhancing precipitation through increased evaporation accounts for around 10% of the winter increase, but is overall minor compared to remote large-scale processes. Combined, these factors result in accumulation increases that currently offset the mass loss from accelerated ice discharge in Antarctica and point to processes important for future projections.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Platinum-based chemotherapy is commonly used for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) treatments, yet clinical outcomes remain poor. Cellular senescence and its associated secretory phenotype (SASP) can have multiple tumor-promoting activities, but both are largely unexplored in these cancers. In this study, using xenograft, orthotopic and Kras G12V -driven murine NSCLC models, we demonstrate that cisplatin-induced senescence strongly promotes malignant phenotypes and tumor progression, which is stimulated by aging. Mechanistically, we found that a transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ)-enriched SASP drives pro-proliferative effects through TGFBR1 and AKT/mTOR. TGFBR1 inhibition with galunisertib or senolytic treatment reduces tumor progression driven by cisplatin-induced senescence, and concomitant use of TGFBR1 inhibitors with platinum-based chemotherapy reduces tumor burden and improves survival. Finally, we validate the translational relevance of tumor-promoting TGFβ-enriched SASP using clinical NSCLC and HGSOC samples from patients who received neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Together, our findings identify a potential cancer therapy resistance mechanism and provide preclinical proof of concept for future trials.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Different neuron types show distinct susceptibility to age-dependent degeneration, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we applied aging clocks to single neuron types in C aenorhabditis elegans and found that distinct neurons differ in their biological age. Ciliated sensory neurons with high neuropeptide and protein biosynthesis gene expression show accelerated aging and degeneration, correlating with loss of function, which could be prevented by pharmacological inhibition of translation. We show that the C. elegans neuronal aging transcriptomes correlate with human brain aging patterns and anticorrelate with geroprotective interventions. We performed an in silico drug screen to identify potentially neuroprotective small molecules. We show that the natural occurring plant metabolite syringic acid and the piperazine derivative vanoxerine delay neuronal degeneration, and propose these compounds as neuroprotective interventions. Furthermore, we identify neurotoxins that accelerate neurodegeneration, indicating that distinguishing aging trajectories between neuron types can inform on protective interventions as well as risk factors.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We consider the mathematical properties of economic models concerned with value maximisation, including integrated assessment models. We illustrate how the outcomes that result from maximising value subject to convergence to a steady state in the long run may be very different from the outcomes that arise from maximising value without requiring such convergence. We contend that many economic models include an assumption (sometimes hidden) that the economy converges to a steady state in the long run, so the outcome if such an assumption does not hold true may be very different from the model predictions. We reflect on the intergenerational injustice relating to this and other ethical and mathematical considerations in economic models, in the context of environmental and social issues. We hope to encourage improved communication and awareness of modelling assumptions, and a more fundamental rethink of economic models, values and policies, given the magnitude of the risks currently faced by humanity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Drosophila Toll/NF-κB pathway has been extensively studied for its roles in innate immunity and embryonic development. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms underlying Spz/Toll signaling in non-immune contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate a critical role for Toll in regulating intestinal stem cell activity through direct transcriptional control of PI3K and Akt in an insulin-independent manner. Time-series transcriptomic analysis of intestinal damage and repair responses reveals that the stress-responsive factor Jumu regulates Spz expression to activate Toll signaling. Disruption of the Jumu/Spz/Toll cascade or PI3K/Akt signaling impairs intestinal regeneration and suppresses tumor growth, and epistasis analysis confirms that PI3K/Akt functions downstream of Toll . Our findings elucidate an autocrine Spz/Toll-mediated mechanism that drives stem cell function via the PI3K/Akt pathway during tissue homeostasis and uncover a critical non-immune role of Toll signaling in both physiological and pathological contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS) is a critical cytosolic DNA sensor, whose activity can be regulated by acetylation. Here, we show that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + )-dependent lysine deacetylase SIRT4 interacts with cGAS and positively regulates innate immune responses triggered by DNA viruses or cytoplasmic DNA. Overexpression of SIRT4 inhibits HSV-1 infection, whereas knockdown of SIRT4 has the opposite effect. Deficiency of SIRT4 , or treatment with a SIRT4 inhibitor, impairs antiviral innate immune signaling in response to DNA viruses or cytoplasmic DNA, both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, SIRT4 inhibitor treatment attenuates type I interferon signaling in Trex1 -deficient cells and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Mechanistically, SIRT4 deacetylates cGAS and enhances its association with double‑stranded DNA. Collectively, our study identifies SIRT4 as a positive regulator of cGAS-mediated innate immune signaling pathways, which advances the understanding of the regulation of cGAS activity.",

Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) offers an accessible, scalable solution. This article analyzes the outcomes of two interventions connecting Chemistry undergraduates (University of York, UK) with Chemical Engineering postgraduates (University of Zaragoza, Spain). The objective was to foster these transversal skills alongside a holistic, systems-thinking understanding of biorefinery concepts. Over 6-week projects, two cohorts worked in international, interdisciplinary pairs, including both fully remote “e-pairs” and co-located “in-place” pairs, to produce scientific media. The findings demonstrate exceptional student engagement and the cultivation of a systems-thinking approach. The model fostered sociocultural competencies: non-native speakers enhanced professional fluency, while native speakers learned to moderate their language for inclusive communication. Critically, this study revealed that fully remote “e-pairs” outperformed co-located “in-place” pairs in digital-age skills, notably in their proactive use of social media for dissemination and their intuitive creation of more inclusive, accessible outputs. This work validates the COIL framework as an alternative to physical mobility, concluding that a well-structured virtual exchange can be effective for cultivating the digital and intercultural competencies required by the next generation of global scientists and engineers.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Standardized clinical terminology is essential for semantic interoperability. Typically, a hospital's terminology expert manually maps local terminology with international standards such as SNOMED CT. The manual mapping process is demanding, labor-intensive, and time-consuming, and its effectiveness relies on the expertise of the professional handling it. Objective: We developed a method to map clinical terms to SNOMED CT concept descriptions using an information retrieval (IR) approach with rich synonyms. We also provide a free mapping support service to help terminology experts alleviate the challenges of manual mapping without the need for additional manipulation. Methods: We created indexes using edge n-grams and synonyms. We adopted Elasticsearch for indexing and query processing, incorporating data from the SPECIALIST Lexicon to enrich the synonym database. Eight different indexes were initially created, but only four were retained based on performance. We tested indexes individually and in combination, using a dataset of 1,753 one-to-one mapped instances from the National Library of Medicine ICD-9-CM Procedure codes to the SNOMED CT Map. We compared our approach with MetaMap for evaluation. Results: We found that using rich synonyms and edge n-gram indexing significantly improved the accuracy of mapping clinical terms to SNOMED CT. The indexes incorporating synonyms and edge n-grams performed better than those using either technique alone. Combining these methods captured more relevant terms and synonyms, resulting in more precise mappings. Our method outperformed the baseline provided by MetaMap, demonstrating enhanced capability in handling complex medical terminology and improving the overall mapping quality. Conclusions: Our study introduced an IR method with rich synonyms for mapping clinical terms to SNOMED CT, analyzing 42 unmapped terms, and identifying key issues. The approach shows promise in improving terminology mapping, and future work will explore advanced methods to enhance accuracy further, aiming to reduce manual mapping efforts and improve result evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a significant public health challenge, affecting multiple organs and organ systems, and fetal health. Additionally, AUD also significantly contributes to self-harm and road accidents. Beyond its health effects, AUD creates economic and political challenges, including escalating treatment costs and the complex alcohol regulation policies. Despite global impact, AUD remains under-addressed in countries like India due to cultural norms and limited resources. Early recognition of AUD is vital for better outcomes, relying on thorough clinical evaluation and patient history. However, denial, inebriation, or lack of awareness often delays diagnosis. Imaging techniques like ultrasound, CT, and MRI effectively depict AUD-related organ damage and aid in detecting chronic alcohol use. Radiologists play a crucial role in identifying these manifestations, contributing to its early detection and treatment. This review article highlights the imaging of alcohol use related disorders and diseases affecting different organs and organ systems at various stages. The review is presented in two parts: the first focuses on alcohol burden, alcohol metabolism and toxicity, and imaging findings of AUD-related abdominal diseases and disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Congenital upper limb anomalies (CULA) are common, but the actual magnitude of the problem within the community remains undetermined due to a lack of a registry system. Our study aimed to determine the epidemiology of CULA, its syndromic associations with other systems, to identify and categorize upper limb anomalies according to the International Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand (IFSSH) classification, to study the inheritance pattern of the disease, and to investigate the association of risk factors during the antenatal period. This ambispective study was conducted at a tertiary care center from January 2022 to July 2024. Exclusion criteria included stillbirths, vascular malformations, congenital peripheral nerve disorders, and birth brachial plexus injuries. Comprehensive demographics, antenatal, perinatal, and postnatal histories, as well as family pedigrees, were documented. Each CULA case was classified according to the IFSSH guidelines, and statistical analysis was performed using Stata 18.0. There were 148 cases, with 5 dropouts, with a mean age of presentation being approximately 7 years, with approximately 58% males and approximately 42% females. The ratio of bilateral:right:left was 3.8:1.7:1. The most common non-hand involvement was in the foot, with the ratio of bilateral:right:left being 13.4:4.5:1. The mean birth weight was 2.75 kg, and the mothers' mean age at the time of birth was 26 years. There were three cases born to a consanguineously married couple, and four cases were detected on ultrasonography, with no significant correlation. There was positive familial correlation in IFSSH II, III, and VI categories, with p-values of 0.037, 0.001, and 0.026, respectively. The most common occurrence was seen in the IFSSH II category (98 cases) and the least in the IFSSH VI category (7 cases). A substantial gap exists in the literature regarding the epidemiology and registry systems for CULA, rendering the full extent of the issue within communities ambiguous. However, IFSSH II is the most common anomaly with a varying pattern. Positive family history is commonly observed in IFSSH II, III, and VI groups, and syndromic associations are more prevalent in groups I and VII.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Sinus pericranii (SP) is a rare vascular malformation characterized by abnormal communication between intracranial and extracranial venous systems. Often asymptomatic and presenting as a soft, nonpulsatile scalp mass, SP can be mistaken for other scalp anomalies, such as scalp arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), due to overlapping clinical features. This case of a 4-year-old girl successfully treated for a giant SP is reported to illustrate the findings of a comprehensive systematic literature review. This review was conducted according to the “Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews” guidelines. Relevant studies (1985–2025) reporting patients with SP were identified from PubMed/MEDLINE databases. A total of 65 studies reporting 82 SP patients were included in this study. The median age was 8 years, ranging from 4 months to 72 years, with a male predominance of 61.0% (n = 50). No contributing factors were reported in most cases (67.1%, n = 55). However, craniosynostosis and recent trauma were reported as contributing factors to the development of SP in 7.3% (n = 6) and 18.3% (n = 15), respectively. Frontal (37.8%, n = 31), parietal (32.9%, n = 27), and occipital (13.4%, n = 11) were the most reported locations of SP. The median follow-up duration was 24 months (3–96). This is the first systematic review of the SP, where the authors highlight, by data synthesis, the clinical presentation, dural sinus involvement, management, and outcome of this rare but challenging pathology. Without management guidelines, its treatment choice is still based on the surgeon's experience. This reality calls for action for an evidence-based study.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract With a steady onslaught of extreme weather events and quickly surpassed temperature records, the climate crisis is increasingly moving from the realm of hypotheticals to that of lived experience. In this context, many sociologists have called for their discipline to make climate change a core agenda item. While climate change-focused sociology has certainly increased of late, a general dissatisfaction with the discipline’s treatment of the issue remains. Two obstacles to developing of a fully fledged “sociology of climate change” are tensions of temporality and scale; its global scope and a tendency to discuss it in terms of possible futures make it difficult to frame climate change in terms of the present-day and localized phenomena many sociologists study. I propose Raymond Williams’s concept of “structures of feeling” as a cultural framework for studying climate change as it is actively experienced in the present. Williams used structures of feeling to describe the distinctive quality of experience that characterizes a period, and to challenge us to consider how the personal, affective realm of “feeling” is implicated in social processes that transcend us. Using computational methods and qualitative analysis and following Williams’ assertion that structures of feeling are most visible in creative work, I analyze short stories in the literary subgenre of “climate fiction.” I find a temporal shift in these works, where they transition between imagining the acute destruction of climate chaos and the possibilities of post-apocalypse. I take these shifts to indicate underlying patterns in the affective social experience of climate change.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study examines whether consumers exhibit differential responses to equivalent expressions of the benefits associated with green products when presented in varying usage-based scales or units. Specifically, it investigates the impact of scale frame on green purchase intention by comparing large-number frames to small-number frames. Results from a sample of 302 consumers indicate that green benefits expressed in a large-number frame significantly increase green purchase intention compared to those in a small-number frame. Perceived value serves as a mediator for this positive effect, whereas consumer skepticism exerts a suppressive influence on this relationship. Consequently, the large-number frame can be regarded as a double-edged sword in terms of promoting green purchase intention. Furthermore, regulatory focus moderates these effects in such a way that consumers with a promotion focus exhibit a higher purchase intention because of an enhanced perceived value in the large-number frame. In contrast, consumers with a prevention focus demonstrate a lower purchase intention due to increased skepticism toward the benefits framed in large numbers. These findings contribute to the literature on information framing, regulatory fit, and pro-environmental behaviours, offering valuable insights for businesses and governments to design effective communication campaigns by aligning environmental information with the motivational states of their target audience, thereby further promoting pro-environmental behaviours.",

    "Abstract": "There are non-negligible exciton couplings and coherent oscillations in the excitation energy transfer within the light-harvesting complex and the exciton dynamics. In addition, the exciton dynamics depends on a variety of system parameters, such as electron coupling, electron–phonon coupling, and the site energy of each chromophore. In order to investigate the detailed interaction process, we propose an extended perturbation theory approach and derive the coherent dynamics of reduced density matrices under arbitrary orthogonal transformations. Our method quantitatively presents the dependence of system parameters on exciton state dynamics and the mathematical analysis of coherent dynamics, expands the application boundary of standard Förster and modified Redfield theories, and provides a mathematical description in the general case with an arbitrary basis. In the two-level dimer system, our model provides an excellent correspondence with the calculation of numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion. As an application, we quantitatively describe the long-lived vibronic coherence within recombinant allophycocyanin and the electron coherence process between chromophores within cryptophyte phycocyanin 645.",

    "Abstract": "We examine the microscopic origin of the pronounced x-ray scattering pre-peaks observed in water-rich aqueous alkylamine mixtures. While neat amines display weak pre-peaks compared to alcohols, and aqueous alcohols generally exhibit none, aqueous amines display a striking and unexpected signal. Molecular dynamics simulations of primary amines from propylamine to octylamine show that nitrogen head groups preferentially saturate the surfaces of water-rich domains, stabilizing both water and amine regions through water–nitrogen donor hydrogen bonding. This interfacial anchoring prevents macroscopic demixing except at high water contents, where too few amines remain to cover the interfaces. The resulting disordered bilayer-like arrangement generates long-ranged domain oscillations that appear as positive like–like species and negative cross species correlations, whose partial cancellation produces the experimental pre-peak. Model comparisons further show that the effect is highly sensitive to both solute and water force fields, with the CHARMM-AA/SPC/E combination offering the most consistent description. These results establish aqueous amines as prototypical systems in which stable micro-heterogeneity and supramolecular topology directly give rise to scattering pre-peaks, providing a concrete bridge between molecular liquids and micro-emulsions.",

    "Abstract": "The cerium iso-structural phase transition (γ–α) is dominated by f-electron localization changes that results in a magnetic ordering change and a volume collapse. Generally, these physics are difficult to capture with ab initio and first principles methods. However, previous works have shown various methods to be successful in predicting at least some of the physics of the γ to α phase transition. Therefore, here, we perform a broad survey of density functional based methods across three levels of theory and types of functions [GGA (generalized gradient approximation), MetaGGA, and hybrid functionals] and compare the results, focusing on hydrostatic compression across the phase boundary at zero kelvin. For the methods that best reproduce experimental results, we directly probe the predicted mechanisms and frame the results in the Mott/Kondo debate, assessing how the underlying methods and assumptions of different functionals can assess the physical drivers in the phase transition, providing insight into the governing processes of this unique phase transition.",

    "Abstract": "Background Obstructed defaecation is a form of constipation, with fragmented stooling, excessive straining, self-digitation and a sense of incomplete emptying. Structured pelvic floor muscle training that identifies, promotes and reinforces correct muscle activity has been reported to assist these patients. Aims The aim of this study was to measure physiological effects and patient compliance of a goal-orientated pelvic floor muscle training program used to treat obstructed defaecation. Methods Female patients with obstructed defaecation referred to a tertiary hospital for anorectal physiology studies were identified. The patients underwent pre- and post- program anorectal examination including manometry, pudendal nerve terminal motor latency, and transvaginal and endoanal ultrasonography. Patients completed a structured physiotherapy program, and patient compliance and satisfaction were measured. Results Fifty-nine female patients were recruited to the study, mean age 60 years. Patient satisfaction with the programme was high (mean 8.488:SD 1.5; range 2-10). At completion of the program, KESS scores significantly decreased (12 ± 7) compared to baseline (15 ± 6), p &amp;lt; .002 and the Oxford Grading Scale for pelvic floor strength showed a significant improvement (p=0.005). On rectal balloon distension the maximal tolerable volume showed a significant decrease from 180mL to 146mL (p &amp;lt; .005). Conclusion This program demonstrated significant physiological improvements and high patient satisfaction. The observed reductions in KESS scores, changes in pelvic floor strength and rectal sensation indicate that this structured intervention effectively enhances anorectal function. Further research with larger, controlled studies is needed to confirm these findings and to optimise training protocols for broader clinical application.",

Historically, melatonin has been seen as a pineal hormone that plays one essential role – the synchronisation of reproductive and other brain-controlled functions with changes in photoperiod. Often driven by the detection of melatonin receptors in non-brain tissues, it has become clear that melatonin plays a much wider variety of roles in the function of the testis, sperm, ovary, follicles, oocyte, embryo, placenta, fetus, and mammary gland.

    "Abstract": "Genetic diversity, the fundamental substrate for evolutionary potential, is declining globally at unprecedented rates. Yet the mechanisms governing its distribution across species remain poorly understood, with competing hypotheses emphasizing either historical demography or contemporary ecological constraints. This debate limits our capacity to predict species' responses to environmental change. Here, based on systematic sampling and a unified analytical pipeline, we de novo assembled genomes for 120 songbird species breeding in the Himalayas–Hengduan Mountains (HHMs) and conducted population genomic analysis to examine the drivers of their genomic diversity. We observed a 6.5-fold variation in genome-wide heterogeneity and a 16.4-fold variation nucleotide diversity across species. Notably, these measures of genomic diversity showed no correlation with recent population dynamics, current population size, or other contemporary factors—such as elevational distribution, or life-history traits. Instead, historical demography strongly predicted genetic diversity, with ancestral population size during the late Pleistocene emerging as the sole correlate: Larger ancestral sizes consistently coincided with higher diversity. These findings underscore the critical influence of historical demography on contemporary genetic diversity in natural populations—an insight essential for designing effective conservation strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Despite the economic importance of lithium, there is considerable disagreement over the processes that concentrate it and other rare metals in pegmatite-type lithium deposits. Two main processes have been invoked, namely extreme differentiation of a peraluminous granitic magma and direct anatexis of a sedimentary protolith. We use geochemical modeling to quantify lithium enrichment via these two processes from a study of the Jiajika lithium pegmatite field, one of the largest of its type in the world. Based on a lithium–silicon–boron–barium (Li-Si-B-Ba) isotope study involving systematic sampling along 4,211-m of core from two deep boreholes and from the regional zonation of pegmatites at outcrops, we propose a three-stage model for the formation of the pegmatite field: i) generation of a rare metal-rich melt by deep anatexis, involving ~5% partial melting of metapelitic rocks in the presence of 10 to 30% metamorphic fluid; ii) gradual enrichment of rare metals along a path of continuous magma differentiation until 75% of the initial melt had crystallized; and iii) a final stage of lithium mineralization during the escape of the water-rich magma due to the overpressures created in response to massive fluid exsolution and the extensional stress in the granite dome structure. The study provides important insights into how lithium-rich pegmatites can be targeted during exploration for pegmatite-hosted resources of lithium.",

    "Abstract": "Antigenic variation in Trypanosoma brucei ( T. brucei ) requires monoallelic expression of one variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) from one of the subtelomeric bloodstream form (BSF) expression sites (BESs). This transcription is unusually mediated by RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) and occurs in a specialized nuclear body, the expression site body (ESB). While factors promoting active BES transcription and silencing inactive BESs are known, how these opposing activities are integrated remains unknown. Here, we identify ESBX (Tb927.3.1660) as a BSF-specific ESB protein necessary for this coordination. We show that ESBX RNAi knockdown prevents RNA Pol I localizing to the ESB and reduces active BES transcription, while also derepressing inactive BESs with low processivity transcription. Conversely, ESBX overexpression weakly activates inactive BESs in a distinct manner from ESBX knockdown, leading to processive transcription, without disrupting the active BES or forming supernumerary ESBs. ESBX knockdown causes a similar transcriptomic defect to ESB1 and VEX2 knockdown combined, establishing ESBX as a key factor linking transcriptional activation of the active BES with inactive BES silencing through the VSG exclusion (VEX) phenomenon. This allows us to suggest models for understanding the establishment and maintenance of monoallelic expression critical for parasite immune evasion.",

    "Abstract": "Fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons provide precisely timed, context-dependent inhibition within cortical circuits. PV neuron firing properties are specialized among cortical neurons, suggesting that they express a unique complement of ion channels. Here, we show that the PV-specific silent voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel subunit Kv6.4 (encoded by Kcng4 ) modulates both intrinsic and synaptic properties of cortical PV neurons. Kv6.4 does not form functional channels on its own but, as shown in prior work, assembles with Kv2 subunits to create heterotetrameric channel complexes, effectively reducing Kv2-mediated delayed rectifier current. We find that Kcng4 expression is enriched within a distinct Pvalb -expressing subclass in primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex and emerges during postnatal development. In PV neurons, Kv6.4 loss reduces action potential (AP) height and width, hyperpolarizes the threshold and interspike potential, and accelerates AP upstroke particularly during repetitive firing. Kv6.4 loss, potentially due to the changes in AP waveform, also alters GABA release and paired-pulse depression at synapses made by PV onto pyramidal (PYR) neurons. The effects of Kv6.4 loss are amplified during high-frequency firing, within the physiological range of fast-spiking PV neurons, likely due to altered repolarization dynamics that accumulate across successive APs. These findings are thus consistent with the function of Kv6.4 in modifying Kv2-mediated delayed rectifier currents. Hence, Kv6.4 tunes the temporal precision of PV inhibitory output, a feature that may be critical for stable excitation–inhibition ratios and adaptive circuit function underlying learning and behavior.",

However, highly-skilled immigrants — especially from Sub Sahara Africa –seeking employment in Finland experience a prolonged and uncertain cycle of new demands for resilience. By drawing on research interviews with highly-skilled black Africans, the article illuminates the negative aspects of resilience for negatively racialised immigrants in the global North. The findings of the thematic analysis bring forth the how skilled jobseekers understand, navigate, and give meaning to the resilience demanded of them as the Finnish labour markets keep shifting goal posts and adding barriers of exclusion and precarity. Accordingly, resilience can further and uphold injustice and for those having to perform resilience it can become a curse, antithetical to positive change.",

    "Abstract": "Borders and boundaries have long served as powerful metaphors in migration and queer studies, yet they risk reproducing heteronormative paradigms that equate (border) penetration with power, and movement with violation. Drawing on interviews from research with queer refugees in Berlin and Copenhagen, this article foregrounds bodies, sexual desires and pleasures, dimensions often marginalized within queer asylum scholarship. Through two empirical vignettes, the analysis mobilizes \"circlusion,\" a concept developed as a counterpart to penetration, as a conceptual alternative for examining queer migration as an embodied process of opening rather than intrusion. Rather than displacing existing analyses of violence, surveillance, and credibility, the article situates circlusion as an analytical lens that brings desire and pleasure into view within the asylum contexts. Focusing on the lived, sexual experiences of Joshua and Khaled, the article shows how queer refugees can be understood not only as objects of control but also as agents of pleasure, relation, and subversion. By centering desires beyond credibility, this contribution opens space for more nuanced engagements with pleasure, agency, and embodiment in queer asylum research, without reducing queer refugees to either victims or icons of resistance.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the longitudinal development and interrelations of motivation, ethnic identity, and self-perceived proficiency in Chinese among 46 adolescent Chinese heritage language learners attending Chinese language schools in Belgium. Using four waves of data collected over two academic years, the study first examined changes in the three constructs. Although group-level analyses showed overall stability, qualitative responses revealed meaningful individual-level fluctuations in both motivation and ethnic identity. Cross-lagged analyses then assessed how the constructs influenced one another over time. Motivation and ethnic identity demonstrated reciprocal longitudinal effects, indicating that each contributes to the other’s development. Motivation and self-perceived proficiency were connected mainly through concurrent associations, suggesting immediate but not lasting links. By contrast, ethnic identity and perceived proficiency showed moderately positive correlations without predictive effects. These findings provide the first longitudinal evidence from Europe-based Chinese language school contexts on how the three constructs evolve and interact. They underscore the importance of pedagogical practices that foster ethnic identity, sustain motivation, and build learners’ confidence in their heritage language proficiency, which together shape adolescents’ heritage language learning process.",

    "Abstract": "Trifloxystrobin (TFX) is a strobilurin fungicide that has a lipophilic nature, which allows it to accumulate in the brain. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate effective methods for preventing brain damage caused by TFX. We aimed to assess the protective benefits of myricetin (MYR) against toxicities brought on by TFX. SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to an inhibiting concentration of 50% (IC50) of TFX (100 µM), and the protective effect of MYR was tested at concentrations of 5, 10, 20, and 50 µM. Cell viability, oxidative stress, and integrated stress response (ISR) activation via the DELE1-HRI pathway were used to assess cytotoxicity. Apoptosis was evaluated by measuring phosphatidylserine externalization, cytochrome c release, Bax and caspase 3 activation, and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δ<i>Ψm</i>). Results showed that TFX (100 µM) significantly decreased cell viability and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, malondialdehyde (MDA) production, and superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase (CAT) activities. However, pretreatment with 50 µM MYR significantly restored cell viability to nearly 100% compared to control cells. Furthermore, MYR pretreatment inhibited ISR activation by reducing ATF4 and CHOP expression and decreased apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. These quantitative results point to MYR as a potent natural substance that may protect cells from TFX-induced neurotoxicity.",

    "Abstract": "Rowing technique to achieve optimal boat velocity depends on individual rowing style. Traditionally, quantification of rowing technique has involved discrete point analysis, limiting the understanding and interpretation of the stroke cycle with data loss occurring between the reported metrics. However, higher dimensional statistical approaches, such as functional data analysis (FDA), can facilitate enhanced understandings of temporal patterns within time series data such as force and acceleration profiles. The aim of the study was to distinguish technique characteristics during single sculling using a novel functional clustering method considering the whole stroke cycle for analysis. Twenty-five elite rowers (12 females, 25 ± 2.5 years and 13 males, 27 ± 2.8 years) completed an on-water single sculling biomechanics assessment. Gate force, foot-stretcher force and boat acceleration were independently fitted with a clustering model, with separate models created for each gender. Boat acceleration exhibited the most variability of the three independent variables in cluster group patterns and individual rowers. Results revealed more than one approach to achieving optimal boat velocity at the elite level and technical coaching strategies should be based on the individual rather than attempting to replicate successful elite rowers' technique who may exhibit a different set of physical and technical attributes.",

    "Abstract": "β-Thalassemia is a hereditary hemoglobinopathy characterized by chronic anemia, iron overload, and sustained oxidative stress, leading to progressive multisystem complications. Although oxidative stress is well documented in β-thalassemia, its association with peripheral biomarkers reflecting mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and neuroaxonal protein homeostasis has not been sufficiently investigated. This study aimed to evaluate serum monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and total Tau protein levels in patients with β-thalassemia major and minor compared with healthy controls, with an emphasis on phenotype-dependent peripheral biochemical alterations related to disease severity. A total of 90 participants were enrolled, including 20 patients with β-thalassemia major, 30 with β-thalassemia minor, and 40 healthy controls. Serum MAO activity and total Tau protein concentrations were measured using ELISA-based assays. Intergroup comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test. Serum MAO activity was significantly higher in the β-thalassemia major group compared with both β-thalassemia minor patients and controls (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Total Tau protein levels were significantly reduced in β-thalassemia major patients, whereas no significant difference was observed between β-thalassemia minor patients and healthy controls. Subgroup analyses revealed positive correlations within both β-thalassemia major and minor groups, consistent with a phenotype-dependent divergence and indicative of Simpson's paradox. In conclusion, β-thalassemia major is characterized by elevated serum MAO activity and reduced total Tau protein levels, reflecting concurrent alterations in systemic oxidative metabolism and peripheral Tau homeostasis. These findings represent peripheral biochemical signatures associated with disease severity rather than direct evidence of central nervous system pathology.",

    "Abstract": "Fat embolism syndrome (FES) in sickle cell disease (SCD) remains a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, often associated with high morbidity and mortality. While red blood cell exchange (RCE) is the standard first-line therapy, some cases continue to deteriorate despite aggressive management. Emerging evidence suggests that therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) may serve as valuable salvage therapy, potentially improving survival in refractory cases. We present two cases of FES in SCD, both marked by an attack of profound hypotension and multiorgan dysfunction, yet with distinct trajectories and responses to therapy. The first case involved a 34-year-old female with FES refractory to conventional treatment, including RCE. A single session of TPE led to rapid clinical stabilization and recovery. The second case described a 28-year-old female with a more severe disease course, requiring five cycles of combined RCE and TPE before achieving clinical improvement and recovery. These cases underscore the potential role of TPE as an adjunct to RCE in managing FES in SCD and highlight the need for further research to establish its efficacy in this critical setting.",

    "Abstract": "This study examined how abortion acompañantes - feminist activists who support self-managed medication abortions outside clinical settings - in northern Mexico enact a feminist ethics of care. Through 13 in-depth interviews with feminist activists in the states of Baja California and Chihuahua, we explored how acompañantes seek to redefine abortion care by centring the needs, emotions and contexts of the people they support. Findings show that they conceptualise feminist care as holistic, horizontal, situated and political. In practice, this includes centring abortion seekers needs; placing feelings at the centre of care; ensuring safety by providing stigma-free information; collaboration with health professionals, while ensuring there is no coercion; and economic support. Drawing on Gilligan's and Brugère's work on a feminist ethics of care, we describe how acompañantes challenge patriarchal paradigms through the use of person-centred models of care. These practices subvert medical and state control, offering an alternative paradigm rooted in social solidarity. The study contributes to the growing literature on feminist abortion accompaniment by demonstrating how care functions as both a form of resistance and a means of political transformation, while also shaping new understandings of safety and quality.",

    "Abstract": "Uterine defects caused by diseases and injuries significantly deteriorate the functions of the uterus and even result in infertility. Tissue engineering scaffolds, possessing comparable mechanical strength and sustained estradiol (E2) release and shape-morphing ability to match the anatomical structure of native uterine tissues, may be effective for treating uterine defects and restoring fertility. In the current study, fibre-reinforced scaffolds were fabricated via electrospinning and 4D printing. Short electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibres encapsulated with polydopamine (PDA) particles (TPU-PDA fibres) were homogenised in poly(L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate) (PLLA-co-TMC, ‘PLATMC’ in short) solutions to engineer fibre-reinforced scaffolds via 4D printing. E2 was loaded in PDA particles. The incorporation of TPU-PDA fibres in the PLATMC solution increased the printability of inks and improved the fidelity of printed scaffolds. Moreover, electrospun TPU-PDA fibres reinforced the mechanical strength of printed scaffolds (>2.5 MPa), and fibre-reinforced scaffolds thus prepared were highly elastic (>600% strain). Also, fibre-reinforced scaffolds exhibited sustained E2 release over 8 weeks, which promoted the growth and proliferation of rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). After programmed shape deformation, fibre-reinforced scaffolds could evolve shape morphing through transforming planar shape into a curved or tubular structure to meet the curvature of uterine tissues after being cultured in a culture medium at 37°C, which provides new insight into uterine regeneration.",

    "Abstract": "Based on the considerations of round-trip in the treatment process, this paper presents a mathematical model aimed at studying the dynamic behaviour and epidemiological trends of HIV/AIDS. We first calculate the basic reproduction number <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:msub><mml:mover><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>̅</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math> and discuss the stability of equilibrium points and the existence of forward bifurcations, validating the theoretical results through numerical simulations. Subsequently, using cumulative HIV/AIDS case data reported in China, we estimate model parameters using the least squares method, achieving a good fit. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses were performed on the model parameters to explain the dependence of the parameters on the infection variables. Finally, the model is applied to evaluate the control effects of treatment coverage at different stages of infection. The results suggest that reducing HIV/AIDS exposure, improving HIV/AIDS screening, promoting infectious disease treatment and increasing disease prevention awareness are the most effective measures to prevent HIV/AIDS infection.",

    "Abstract": "Many people enter addiction treatment through the criminal justice system, which has an important role in oversight, accountability, and adherence to addiction treatment. While urine drug tests (UDT) are valuable tools in addiction treatment, they are easily misinterpreted which can result in tragic legal and social consequences. Practical solutions are needed to enhance the integrity of UDT in the criminal justice system and to ensure that the twin goals of individual rehabilitation and community safety are achieved. Clinicians should remain within the scope of their training, involve the appropriate professionals, understand the limitations, and be aware of the most common areas of misinterpretation of UDT. Proper objective assessment of the data by a qualified professional is essential to avoid serious consequences to due process. Furthermore, there are no current statistics on the total numbers of people receiving UDT in the criminal justice system, resulting in a paucity of data and research on UDT and its effectiveness in addiction treatment. Due to the time needed to update and educate court professionals, practical solutions offer a bridge to solving the most common issues facing this vulnerable population. Updated guidance is needed to enhance the integrity of UDT in the criminal legal system.",

    "Abstract": "Blackcurrant anthocyanins have been investigated for their effects on exercise‑induced substrate utilisation. Previous research has examined the influence of supplementation dose, duration, and exercise modality, with mixed findings. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the effect of blackcurrant supplementation on exercising substrate utilisation. Electronic searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCOhost between the 1st May and 14th November 2025 using a predefined search strategy. Controlled trials investigating the effects of blackcurrant supplementation on fat and carbohydrate oxidation during exercise in physically active adults (18-65 years) were included. All forms, doses, and supplementation durations were eligible, provided outcomes were reported as absolute rates of substrate utilisation during exercise. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool, with a random-effects meta-analysis undertaken on the mean difference between control or placebo and consumption of blackcurrant extract on exercise substrate utilisation. Searches returned 263 articles, with 15 studies included with 226 participants after full-text screening. Meta-analysis demonstrated blackcurrant extract to increase fat oxidation (0.042 g·min-1, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and decrease carbohydrate oxidation (-0.099 g·min-1, <i>P</i> = 0.012). Blackcurrant can increase fat oxidation and decrease carbohydrate oxidation during exercise. However, this finding is not consistent for individuals and factors such as training status, sex, dosage, duration of intake may determine responses. The review was registered on the 28th April 2025 in PROSPERO (CRD420251030222).",

    "Abstract": "The convergence of emerging infectious diseases, accelerating ecological changes, and increasing global mobility makes Vaccine Literacy (VL) a critical component of contemporary travel medicine. Enhanced VL can facilitate more effective provider-traveler communication, ultimately reducing infectious disease transmission risks associated with international travel. This cross-sectional survey aimed to measure VL levels among Italian travelers through an online survey using the 'Vaccine Literacy Brief Tool' (VLBT), a new three-item instrument assessing functional, interactive, and critical dimensions, derived from previously validated measures. Additional study objectives were to explore VL relationships with antecedents, attitudes, and outcomes, as well as to establish the tool's construct and criterion validity within the traveler population. Enrollment was conducted through a QR code displayed at nine vaccination clinics across five Italian regions, linking to an anonymous questionnaire (Google Forms) that visiting travelers could voluntarily access and complete before receiving vaccination for their trip. In addition to VL skills, the psychological antecedents of Vaccine Hesitancy (VH), the \"3Cs\" (confidence, complacency, convenience) were assessed. Additional measures included demographic and travel-related variables, as well as behavioral, cognitive and intentional vaccination outcomes. A total of 534 questionnaires were collected between January and July 2025. Participants showed a mean VL score of 3.07 ± 0.66 on a four-point Likert scale, significantly lower than the 3.21 ± 0.42 reported in previous general population studies (<i>p</i> < .001). The mean 3Cs score was 1.92 ± 0.60, indicating relatively high VH levels. VL and 3Cs scores showed a significant negative correlation (r = -0.204, <i>P</i> < .001). Participants consisted primarily of highly educated adults aged 18-40 years. VL scores were negatively associated with younger age (ρ = -0.132, <i>p</i> = .002), and positively with higher educational level (ρ = 0196, <i>p</i> < .001), higher income (ρ = 0.145, <i>p</i> < .001), greater number of information sources consulted (r = 0.104, <i>p</i> = .016), and more favorable vaccination outcomes. Conversely, the 3Cs demonstrated inverse significant relationships with the same demographic and behavioral variables. No significant gender differences emerged for either VL or 3Cs measures. Construct validity of the VLBT was supported by the significant negative correlation between VL and 3Cs scores, and with additional confirmation provided through reliability tests and factor analyses. Criterion validity was demonstrated through significant associations between VL scores and vaccination behaviors: number of vaccines received, vaccination recall accuracy, awareness of destination-specific pre-travel vaccination requirements, and influenza vaccination intention. Mediation analysis revealed that the 3Cs partially mediated the relationship between VL and specific vaccination intention outcomes, while demographic characteristics (age, income) and travel-related factors (number of information sources) significantly moderated these associations. The VLBT assessed travelers' VL levels through three simple questions and demonstrated potential clinical utility in travel medicine. By facilitating identification of individuals with limited literacy levels, the new tool can help providers orientate the discussion for a profitable counseling session. Implementation research is needed to confirm its effectiveness in routine travel clinical practice. The high VH revealed in the traveler population warrants future targeted research.",

    "Abstract": "Seasonal influenza causes substantial morbidity, mortality, and productivity losses worldwide, and although annual vaccination is recommended for adults, coverage in India remains low; corporate vaccination drives may improve access and uptake among working-age adults. We evaluated the safety profile of an inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine administered during a large-scale corporate vaccination program in India. This observational post-marketing surveillance study was conducted during a multi-center drive at Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. where consenting employees aged ≥18 y received a single 0.5 mL intramuscular dose of inactivated influenza vaccine (Vaxiflu-4, Zydus Vaccines). Recipients were observed for 30 min post-vaccination for immediate reactions and instructed to report adverse events (AEs) occurring within 7 d post-vaccination using a standardized reporting form or helpline; AEs were classified as systemic, local, or serious and summarized descriptively. Among 9,000 vaccinated employees (88% male; 75% aged ≤40 y), no serious AEs were reported. Systemic AEs were infrequent, including fever in 13 recipients (0.14%), flu-like symptoms in 9 (0.10%), and headache in 3 (0.03%), all of which were self-limiting. Local AEs were rare, with soreness at the injection site reported by 18 participants (0.20%); no swelling or redness was reported. One case of frozen shoulder (0.01%) was recorded and assessed as unrelated to vaccination. Overall, the inactivated quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Vaxiflu-4) demonstrated a favorable safety profile in this large corporate setting, with very low rates of mild systemic and local AEs and no serious vaccine-related events, supporting workplace influenza vaccination programs as a feasible strategy to improve adult immunization coverage in India.",

    "Abstract": "The balance of primary sport practice and multisport participation during childhood for later success in sport has been debated in models of athlete development. Various mechanisms have been proposed regarding why activity diversity would aid development, including motivation. Here we test this mechanism by assessing childhood sport and other types of activity diversity (within-sport and non-sport activity) among female competitive adolescent athletes in soccer (<i>N</i> = 211; 12-19 yr) and measures of motivation. Athletes in four skill groups (grassroots/Div. 2 to Nationally competitive) completed an online survey about their practice history in soccer (number of teams, positions and play hours), other sports and non-sport activities, and motivation and commitment. Not surprisingly, higher skill groups participated in more childhood soccer practice than lower skill groups, but they showed less sport diversity and there were no differences in non-sport activity participation. The higher skill groups reported more soccer play and more team diversity than lower groups, but showed greater position specialization in childhood. Total (and relative) hours in soccer practice and play (compared to non-soccer) were positively correlated with soccer motivation. These data are consistent with pathways of skill development in soccer based on early majority engagement in the primary sport; without exclusive engagement and high amounts of play. Sampling between sport or other activities was not related to skill or motivation, so there was no evidence of between-activity transfer related to enhanced motivation for soccer.",

Material decomposition was applied to generate xenon and tissue density images (mg/mL). A tissue-based correction was used to isolate the xenon concentration (CXe) in the gas phase of the xenon density images. The resultant CXe images were used to investigate regional ventilation defects (VDs) by comparing the VD fraction (VDF, expressed as percentage) between baseline and post-MCh conditions.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Traditional polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement faces challenges, including stress shielding due to its high elastic modulus and thermal damage from polymerization exotherm. This study develops a novel BiInSn-PMMA composite bone cement that simultaneously addresses these limitations. The results demonstrate that the mechanical properties of the composite bone cement can be effectively controlled by adjusting the ratio of BiInSn powder, thus meeting the requirements of different bone tissues. The phase change characteristics of BiInSn significantly reduce thermal risk, lowering the peak temperature in surrounding tissues from 57.6°C to 48.3°C and shortening the duration above 47°C from 210 seconds to 39 seconds. In addition, the introduction of BiInSn provides the composite bone cement with good radiographic visibility while exhibiting excellent cytocompatibility in vitro. Overall, this BiInSn-PMMA composite bone cement possesses adjustable mechanical properties, low risk of thermal damage, good radiographic visibility, and low cytotoxicity, demonstrating its potential value in bone defect repair.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder, and seizures significantly impact quality of life of affected individuals. Electroencephalography (EEG) based seizure detection has emerged as a critical research area to improve the diagnosis and management of epilepsy. However, existing methods often suffer from poor generalisability and high computational complexity, emphasizing the need for rapid, accurate, and non-invasive detection frameworks. This study proposes a lightweight end to end attention based deep learning network for automatic seizure detection from raw multichannel EEG signals. The architecture employs multiple residual depthwise separable convolutional (RDSC) blocks for efficient spatial feature extraction, followed by a channel wise attention mechanism to emphasize salient information. Temporal dependencies are modelled using a gated recurrent unit (GRU) layer integrated with a classification head. The proposed model was evaluated on the CHB-MIT dataset using leave-one-patient-out cross-validation (LOPOCV) method, achieving an average accuracy of 91.08%, precision of 91.92%, sensitivity of 90.36%, specificity of 91.86%, and F1-score of 90.86%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and potential for patient independent epileptic seizure detection.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective Focal nodular marrow hyperplasia (FNMH) is a benign entity that can create diagnostic uncertainty for the radiologist and, if not recognised, can lead to unnecessary intervention or cause interruption in potential treatment due to the need for follow-up imaging for clarification. Current research suggests lesions with a standardised uptake value over 3.6 on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and CT scans should be considered metastatic rather than benign. The aims of this study are to analyse the multimodality characteristics of FNMH, educate the reader and to recommend imaging techniques to improve specificity in the absence of histological analysis. Materials and Methods Patients who underwent cross-sectional imaging and nuclear medicine studies, between 2018 and 2023 were collected, after concerns were raised as to the nature of indeterminate bone marrow lesions. Data was collected on demographics, malignancy, site of index lesion, imaging characteristics and follow-up. Results A total of 9 eligible patients were collected. All patients underwent CT and MRI scanning. 8 of the 9 had Positron emission tomography CT (PETCT), of which 7 had standardised uptake values for PETCT exceeding 3.6 using different radiotracers. All but one of the cases were conservatively managed; the remaining case received radiotherapy to their lesion. Conclusion FNMH can demonstrate higher PET standardised uptake values (SUV) than previously reported in the literature. This has important implications for treatment as the SUV overlaps with those of metastatic bony lesions. Work is needed to improve distinction between benign and malignant lesions that lie at this threshold of uptake level.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Alpine catchments encompass heterogeneous soil habitats with varying roles in nutrient cycling. While undeveloped till soils in scree areas are hotspots for nitrate and phosphate leaching, vegetated alpine meadow soils rather efficiently retain nutrients. This study examines the role of microbial communities in nutrient mobilization and retention, beyond the effects of abiotic soil properties. We compared the chemical, microbial, and functional characteristics of scree and meadow soils in four high-elevation catchments of the Tatra Mountains in Central Europe. Despite their lower organic matter content and microbial biomass, scree soils exhibited high concentrations of mobile nitrate and phosphate, low phosphate sorption ability, and significantly greater phosphorus leaching. Their microbiomes were distinct and enriched with pioneer taxa, including lichenized fungi, oligotrophic bacterial lineages (e.g., AD3 and Eremiobacteria), and saprotrophic fungi that specialize in the recycling of microbial necromass. These microbiomes exhibited high biomass-specific activities related to nutrient mobilization. In contrast, meadow soils supported larger microbial communities dominated by fungi with strong plant associations and functional traits that enhance nutrient retention. Our findings demonstrate that soil microbiota actively control nitrogen and phosphorus mobility by acting as either accelerators (in vegetation-free scree areas) or buffers (in meadows) of nutrient leaching from alpine soils.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Viral domestication, the co-option of integrated viral genes for host functions, has been repeatedly documented in endoparasitoid Hymenoptera. Whether this phenomenon extends to other parasitoid insects remains to be assessed. Here, we tested this hypothesis in tachinid flies, the largest group of non-hymenopteran parasitoids. To this end, we investigated patterns of viral endogenization in 52 genomes, including 37 newly sequenced species. Similarly to hymenopteran endoparasitoids, tachinid genomes were found to display numerous endogenous viral elements (EVEs), primarily derived from insect-infecting viruses with either DNA or RNA genomes. However, the majority of integrated sequences were species-specific, with no evidence of major ancient gene domestication events. In addition, the EVE content did not differ between dipteran parasitoids and their free-living Diptera counterparts. These findings contrast with the recurrent viral domestication observed in endoparasitoid Hymenoptera. This pattern is discussed in light of important attributes of tachinid flies including their lack of venom and perforating ovipositor, and their avoidance of the host immune system.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The chromatin accessibility landscape is the basis of cell-specific gene expression. We generated a multi organ, single-nucleus chromatin accessibility landscape from the model organism Rattus norvegicus. For this single-cell atlas, we constructed 25 libraries via snATAC-seq from nine organs in the rat, with a total of over 110,000 cells. Cell classification integrating gene activity scores with known marker genes identified 77 cell types, which were strongly correlated with those in published mouse single-cell transcriptome atlases. We further investigated the enrichment of cell type- and organ-specific transcription factors (TFs), Shared and organ-specific features of endothelial and stromal cells, as well as cross-organ macrophage regulatory states, and the conservation and specificity of gene regulatory programs across species. Together, these findings provide a valuable foundation for dissecting tissue-specific regulatory logic and for advancing cross-organ and cross-species cell type annotation and functional inference in the rat model.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Petunia hybrida is a key genetic model for investigating self-incompatibility (SI), a reproductive barrier governed by the multi-allelic S-locus, which encodes a pistil-specific S-RNase and multiple S-locus F-box (SLF) genes. Due to high heterozygosity and abundant repetitive sequences, previous S-locus assemblies in reference genomes have been fragmented and collapsed. Here, we present the telomere-to-telomere (T2T), haplotype-resolved genomes of two homozygous SI lines (P. hybrida S3LS3L and SVSV), enabling the complete reconstruction of both S-loci. Population genomic analyses delineated their boundaries, spanning approximately 14.01 Mb and 20.83 Mb, respectively. Remarkably, both S-loci exhibited extremely low nucleotide polymorphism and structural variation compared with the remainder of the genome. In addition to the S-RNase and the complete repertoire of SLF genes, we identified two pollen-specific genes, ubiquitin-like and MYB, which may contribute to SI regulation. Our results demonstrate that the genomic architecture of the Petunia S-locus continues to evolve dynamically while retaining the core genetic components essential for SI. Furthermore, we propose six evolutionary scenarios, providing new insights into the processes driving the generation, diversification, loss, functional maintenance, and structural reorganization of SLF genes in Petunia. Overall, the T2T genomes reported here establish P. hybrida as a premier model for comparative genomics and SI research in the Solanaceae family.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Accurate initiation of eukaryotic translation is essential for proteome integrity, yet the process is intrinsically challenged by the potential use of non-AUG start codons. The eIF5-mimic protein 5MP1 (also known as BZW2) has emerged as a pivotal regulator that enhances stringency in start codon selection by competing with eIF5 and eIF2B for binding to eIF2 and eIF3. This competition suppresses non-AUG and repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation and remodels the dynamics of the scanning preinitiation complex. Beyond its biochemical role, accumulating evidence since the first report of BZW1/5MP2 as an oncogene in 2009 indicates that 5MP1/2 proteins promote proliferation, metastasis, and poor prognosis across diverse cancer types. However, the downstream effectors and mechanistic pathways linking translation control to tumorigenesis remain incompletely defined. This review summarizes current biochemical understanding of 5MP1 in translation initiation and synthesizes evidence supporting its tumor-promoting activities, outlining key questions and future directions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Despite advances in engineered adaptive immune cell therapies, current options for innate immune cell therapies are sparse. In this work, we demonstrate the utility of a neutrophil progenitor-based cell therapy. Murine conditionally-immortalized neutrophil progenitors (NPs) overcome some of the hurdles of alternative cell therapies, such as granulocyte transfusion, by engrafting in the unconditioned host and undergoing substantial expansion in vivo. Here we demonstrate the therapeutic value of NPs using a murine model of the primary immunodeficiency chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Those with CGD are highly susceptible to infection with Staphylococcus aureus because of genetic mutations that impair neutrophil antimicrobial function. We find that the prophylactic treatment of CGD mice with transfused NPs rescue them from an otherwise lethal S. aureus pulmonary infection. In investigating the mechanisms behind the improved clearance of S. aureus and survival of CGD mice, our data suggests that the antimicrobial function of host CGD neutrophils is rescued by the presence of donor-derived wild-type neutrophils. We also observe that survival is improved to &amp;gt;50% in the CGD model when mice receive NPs post-infection. This work highlights the application of NPs to improving outcomes to acute bacterial infection in CGD, demonstrating the translational potential of conditionally-immortalized myeloid progenitors as a cellular therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Symptom burden in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients has a negative impact on functional status and quality of life. Despite the high prevalence among hemodialysis (HD) patients, symptoms are often underestimated. We investigated the determinants of symptoms and their impact on mortality in a large cohort of HD patients. Methods We analyzed 1825 HD patients for whom at least one questionnaire about symptoms was available. Machine learning-based algorithms were used to identify longitudinal variables associated with symptoms. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to investigate the association between symptoms and mortality. The additional prognostic value of symptoms was explored by using C-statistics and machine learning classification analyses. Results Appetite Rating, Non-vascular Nervous System Score and Difficulty Following Diet were the variables most associated with symptoms, both at baseline and in longitudinal analyses. Survival analyses showed an independent association between symptoms and all the considered outcomes (Death, Hazard Ratio [HR]fper 10-unit increase: 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87–0.96, P &amp;lt; 0.001; Cardiovascular hospitalizations, HRper 10-unit increase: 0.89, 95% CI 0.84–0.94, P &amp;lt; 0.001; infectious hospitalizations, HRper 10-unit increase: 0.91, 95% CI 0.87–0.96, P &amp;lt; 0.001). However, classification analyses performed by machine learning showed that adding a symptom score to a base model did not significantly improve the performance of the models. Similarly, the improvement in R2, in discrimination power, and in reclassification capability was almost null. Discussion In the large dataset of the Hemodialysis (HEMO) trial, we found that, among the analyzed variables, those related to eating habits and previous comorbidities were the most closely associated with the symptoms score, both at baseline and during follow-up. Although symptoms were associated with severe clinical outcomes, their prognostic power was limited. However, considering symptom burden in dialysis patients, strict monitoring of eating habits may help improve quality of life in these patients.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The solar wind at 1 AU is primarily super-Alfvénic, but rare instances occur when the Alfvén speed surpasses the solar wind speed, resulting in occurrences of sub-Alfvénic intervals. During sub-Alfvénic intervals, the solar wind no longer creates a bow shock around Earth, allowing for a direct interaction between the solar wind and Earth’s magnetopause. The thermal properties and turbulence characteristics of such rarely observed sub-Alfvénic regions at 1 AU are not well understood. Our study comprehensively investigates sub-Alfvénic intervals observed from 1995 to 2023 and identifies a total of eleven such distinct regions embedded within solar wind streams and interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). We focus on examining the thermodynamic properties of these regions by using the polytropic index and compare them with nearby super-Alfvénic regions. We find a transition in polytropic behavior from super-Alfvénic to sub-Alfvénic intervals. Interestingly, we observed a bimodal distribution in the polytropic index, characterized by two distinct states: (i) sub- to super-adiabatic (α &amp;gt; 1) and (ii) non-adiabatic (α &amp;lt; 1). The presence of a non-adiabatic state at 1 AU strongly suggests that heating dynamics is a significant factor influencing the thermodynamic state of the solar wind at this distance. We also investigated turbulence properties, and it indicates that turbulence is lower in sub-Alfvénic flow compared to neighboring super-Alfvénic regions, suggesting different processes are involved in these regions.",

We present a comprehensive evaluation of ensilication, a silica-based encapsulation method enabling ambient-temperature preservation of DNA without compromising sequencing fidelity. Across clinical, genomic, and biochemical analyses, ensilication maintained complete diagnostic concordance with cryogenic controls, detecting all actionable variants in FFPE tumor samples, even at low variant allele frequencies. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that frozen storage accumulated up to 65% more artifactual C &amp;gt; T mutations than ensilicated samples, underscoring its potential to reduce false-positive calls in oncology. Both linear and circular DNA libraries preserved structural integrity across temperatures from − 80 °C to 37 °C. By eliminating cold-chain dependence, ensilication enables decentralized biobanking, point-of-care testing, and equitable access to precision oncology, enabling globally accessible cancer genomics. Its compatibility with emerging sequencing platforms positions ensilication as a foundational technology for next-generation diagnostics and large-scale population studies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) is one of the most promising cell candidates for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI). In recent years, the exosomes of OECs have shown neuroprotective properties in SCI. The aim of the present study was to examine whether exosomes derived from LPS preconditioned OEC could exhibit superior anti‐inflammatory effect and also to investigate the underlying mechanisms. The extracellular vesicles derived from OECs under normal condition (N‐EVs) and LPS preconditioned (L‐EVs) were characterized with electron microscope, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and western blot. Metabolomics analysis was performed to analyze the metabolites in L‐EVs treated microglia. Next, miRNA microarray analysis was used to compare the differential miRNAs in N‐EVs and L‐EVs. And gain and loss function experiments were performed to ascertain the efficacy of the anti‐inflammatory mechanisms of L‐EVs. Our results indicated that L‐EVs could regulate microglia polarization from M1 phenotype to M2 phenotype. The metabolomics analysis showed that L‐EVs treatment altered amino metabolism, and decreased the expression of Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11) in microglia. miRNA microarray analysis showed higher expression level of mir‐1224 in L‐EVs compared with N‐EVs. The in vitro gain and loss function experiments demonstrated that mir‐1224 promotes the degradation of CD44, and further decreases the expression of SLC7A11 in microglia which might involve in the cellular process of modulation microglial polarization. The extracellular vesicle derived from LPS preconditioned OECs exhibit a promising therapeutic paradigm for the treatment of SCI. And L‐EVs alleviated neuroinflammation via modulating microglia polarization through mir‐1224/CD44/SLC7A11 axis.",

This study evaluates bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor known for its anti‐proliferative and anti‐inflammatory properties, using in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro experiments with ARPE‐19 cells revealed that bortezomib significantly reduced migration, proliferation, and contraction, key processes in PVR pathogenesis. In a mouse model of PVR, bortezomib treatment mitigated clinical and histological presentations, showing a protective effect. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that bortezomib inhibited the nuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells (NF‐κB) pathway by reducing its activation and preserving its inhibitor, IκB. Additionally, bortezomib modulated inflammatory responses by suppressing pro‐inflammatory mediators such as MCP‐1, IP‐10, IL‐4, IL‐13, and IL‐17 while enhancing anti‐inflammatory cytokines like IL‐10. These findings highlight the potential of bortezomib as a promising therapeutic option for managing PVR.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Major congenital malformations are common, and most cases have no known etiology because of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors and variable phenotypic outcomes. Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder (CNDD), a cause of multiple congenital malformations and embryo loss, exemplifies this variability in phenotypic presentation, even between siblings with the same underlying genetic variants. Mouse models show that CNDD is caused by embryonic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) deficiency because of the embryos' genetic inability to synthesize NAD and/or insufficient maternal provision of NAD precursors to embryos. But it is unknown when during pregnancy embryos become susceptible to developing malformations and what drives the malformation variability. Here, we induced CNDD in wild‐type mice via the maternal diet and longitudinally tracked affected and unaffected embryos in utero. We compared 3‐day interval measurements of the maternal blood NAD metabolome with embryo phenotype using Fast Spin Echo Magnetic Resonance Imaging, mass spectrometry, and micro‐computed tomography. Malformations varied between litters, but they correlated with different embryo growth dynamics. Mice with lower maternal NAD Salvage Pathway metabolite levels and minimal levels of derived excretion metabolites from embryonic day 6.5 onward had smaller embryos with more malformations. This showed that altered embryo growth and reduced maternal NAD precursor availability during organogenesis resulted in CNDD. Variability in the timing of maternal metabolic perturbation corresponded to variability in organ and tissue defect types between litters. As embryo phenotypes are directly linked to maternal NAD precursor availability prior to and during organogenesis, this suggests NAD‐derived metabolites are potential biomarkers predicting CNDD.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The singing pitch accuracy of children with hearing loss (HL) is typically poor, which may discourage them from singing. Improving this skill is important because it can further impact their cognitive and language development and overall well-being. In children with normal hearing (NH), improving singing pitch accuracy is associated with more musical activities and better language skills. We hypothesized that the singing pitch accuracy of children with HL (1) would be poorer than that of children with NH, (2) would improve more during the music intervention period than during the period without music intervention, (3) would be higher in children who participate in more informal musical activities and (4) would be higher in children who have better semantic verbal fluency performance. Design: The participants were 18 children with HL (age range: 3 to 6 years 10 months; 7 with bilateral cochlear implants, 7 with bilateral hearing aids, 4 with bimodal devices) and 20 children with NH (age range: 2 years 10 months to 6 years 10 months). Children with HL participated in remote or in-person music intervention for 10 weeks. A crossover study design was used, with waiting periods before and after the intervention. Three rounds of measurements were made for each child with HL, before and after each period (at T1, T2, and T3). Children with NH did not participate in the music intervention, and their singing pitch accuracy was measured at a single time point. Children sang the song “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.” A measure of mean note deviation assessed the accuracy of each individually sung note, while a measure of mean interval deviation assessed the accuracy of the relative pitch between two consecutively sung notes (e.g., C4 – F4 = 4th), both averaged across the sung sequence. The average of the “mean note” and “mean interval deviation” was used as a dependent variable in a Linear Mixed Model (LMM). For the semantic verbal fluency task, children listed as many animals as they could in one minute, and the number of correct animal words was calculated. Informal music participation was calculated from a parent-completed questionnaire. The mean of the frequency of these activities/number of correct animal words across T1, T2, and T3 was used in LMM. Results: The singing pitch accuracy of the children with bilateral HL group at baseline (T1) was similar to that of children with NH, and there were no significant effects of intervention versus waiting period on mean note/interval deviation. The LMM showed that (i) the more children with HL participated in informal music activities, the better their singing pitch accuracy (main effect, p = 0.009), and (ii) the better they were at the semantic verbal fluency task, the better their singing pitch accuracy (main effect, p = 0.014). Conclusions: Although a 10-week music intervention did not improve singing pitch accuracy in this study of children with HL, these novel results showed that participation in informal music activities, along with language skills, is an important contributing factor to how accurately children with HL can sing in tune.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: While the mechanisms underlying age-related changes in speech recognition are thought to be multifactorial, cochlear synaptopathy has been proposed as a possible peripheral auditory contributor. Although evidence from animal and human temporal bone studies supporting the presence of age-related cochlear synaptopathy appears compelling, findings from prospective studies in humans have been less conclusive. The goals of this study were to investigate the effect of aging on measures historically used to assess retrocochlear function—speech recognition performance-intensity functions in noise, and high-level auditory brainstem responses (ABR) at two presentation rates, and to examine their association. Design: Nineteen younger (18 to 36 yrs) and 19 older adults (65 to 81 yrs) with normal audiometric pure-tone averages and clinically present distortion product otoacoustic emissions took part in this study. All test materials were presented to the right ear through insert earphones. Performance-intensity functions were obtained using Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6 words in multitalker babble, at 6 signal to noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from −5 to +20 dB SNR (noise fixed at 50 dB HL). ABRs were recorded in response to 80 dB nHL clicks presented at a slower rate (11.3/sec) and a faster rate (41.3/sec). Results: The performance-intensity function slopes were comparable between the younger and older age groups, but older adults needed more favorable SNRs to achieve the same level of performance as their younger counterparts. The electrophysiological finding of lower I/V ABR amplitude ratios in older adults is consistent with an interpretation of cochlear synaptopathy. However, there was no association between the speech recognition performance-intensity function metrics and ABR I/V amplitude ratios, even though full performance-intensity functions were obtained, using low-context monosyllabic words that depend more heavily on peripheral processing. Conclusions: Results of this study show that aging negatively impacted speech recognition in noise and ABR responses. Although the age-related reduction in ABR wave I/V ratios could be interpreted as evidence of cochlear synaptopathy, age did not differentially impact speech recognition in noise as a function of SNR. In addition, there was no association between the electrophysiological and performance-intensity function metrics. These results add to a growing list of perceptual measures that did not follow the pattern of results predicted by age-related cochlear synaptopathy, despite the expected reduction in ABR wave I/V ratios.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Otitis media (OM) is a significant health concern, particularly among Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children who experience one of the highest rates of OM globally. This study aimed to evaluate the use and differences of wideband absorbance at ambient pressure (WBA) among urban Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and non-Aboriginal children with suspected OM based on standard tympanometry. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study in Perth, Western Australia, recruiting children from both tertiary and community-based healthcare settings. A total of 53 children (106 ears) were included in this study, of which 30 children (60 ears) were Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (mean age 4.67 ± 3.76, range: 0.59 to 14.96 years) and 23 children (46 ears) were non-Aboriginal (mean age 3.94 ± 1.53, range: 1.93 to 6.01 years). Each child underwent an audiological assessment, which included otoscopy, single-frequency tympanometry, WBA, otoacoustic emissions, and age-appropriate audiometry. Audiologist examination and interpretation of standard audiological results served as the reference standard for a suspected OM diagnosis. Results: WBA analysis was performed on 104 ears, of which 30 ears were diagnosed with suspected OM using single-frequency tympanometry results. When comparing ears, mean WBA was similar between non-Aboriginal children and Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children without suspected OM at all frequencies ( p &gt; 0.05). Mean WBA was significantly reduced between 500 and 4000 Hz in all children with suspected OM, with a peak difference at 1600 Hz observed between groups ( p &lt; 0.001). Overall, WBA was more reduced in Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children with suspected OM compared with non-Aboriginal children with suspected OM, the only significant difference was observed at 800 Hz ( p = 0.037). Conclusions: For this sample of children living in an urban area, WBA is significantly reduced in the ears of children with suspected OM compared with those children with healthy middle ears. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children without suspected OM show comparable WBA results to non-Aboriginal children with normal ears. However, Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children with suspected OM exhibit lower overall WBA than their non-Aboriginal peers with OM, with a significant difference observed at 800 Hz. These findings support previous research that suggests WBA may be a valuable tool in detecting OM, particularly in high-risk populations. Further research is needed to investigate the factors contributing to reduced WBA in Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children with OM and to validate WBA’s potential in addressing the under-detection of OM in this population.",

    "Abstract": "Acute coronary syndromes most commonly arise from rupture of biologically vulnerable, rather than hemodynamically severe, coronary plaques. Advances in intravascular and noninvasive imaging techniques, including intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, near-infrared spectroscopy, and coronary computed tomography angiography, have enabled precise identification of high-risk plaque features such as thin fibrous caps, large lipid cores, and high plaque burden. While intensive lipid-lowering therapy favorably modifies plaque composition and reduces cardiovascular risk, interventional strategies are needed to directly stabilize nonflow-limiting but biologically vulnerable plaques. Intracoronary cryotherapy has emerged as a novel, investigational approach aimed at modifying plaque biology through controlled thermal modulation without permanent intracoronary implantation. Preclinical studies demonstrate increased fibrous cap thickness and collagen content following cryotherapy, consistent with plaque stabilization. Early first-in-human experience suggests technical feasibility and short-term safety. This review summarizes contemporary approaches to vulnerable plaque identification, existing pharmacologic and interventional strategies, and the evolving role of intracoronary cryotherapy as a potential plaque-directed therapy.",

    "Abstract": "CASE: Adam is a 15-year-old boy who was born prematurely, with prenatal substance exposure, and was diagnosed in early childhood with combined-type attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant disorder. He was not found to meet criteria for fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Despite treatment with stimulant medications and other adjunctive medications, Adam experienced ongoing difficulties with impulse control, sleep, and aggression. Adam was introduced to digital devices at an early age, resulting in unfiltered, poorly supervised, and prolonged screen exposure. Over time, Adam's digital use escalated into late-night gaming and engaging with social media platforms. Attempts by parents and other caregivers to apply parental controls were inconsistent because of family instability and ongoing caregiver substance use. Exposure to disturbing online content (including violence and conspiracy narratives) disrupted Adam's sleep and resulted in increased emotional lability, often triggering nightmares and severe irritability. The school also implemented restrictions on electronic device use (including phones and laptops). Related disciplinary consequences contributed to social stress and peer conflict. In addition, the patient disclosed a history of childhood sexual trauma, which occurred during unsupervised online interactions, further deepening his reliance on digital environments as a coping mechanism. Subsequent identification and treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder helped to alleviate some of the associated distressing emotional symptoms for Adam but did not alter his compulsive use of digital technology. Finally, when consistent efforts were made to limit Adam's screen time, it provoked severe mood dysregulation, aggressive outbursts, and even suicidal ideation. How can clinicians effectively manage digital addiction in a neurodivergent adolescent when restricting device use provokes severe emotional dysregulation and suicidal ideation? What multimodal treatment strategies can balance behavioral containment with trauma-informed care? How can families and clinicians collaboratively establish digital boundaries that promote recovery without triggering psychological destabilization? What does this case reveal about the need for early screening, prevention, and family education regarding digital addiction in neurodivergent youth?",

    "Abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) on menopausal symptoms, quality of life, and depression. Methods: The study was designed as a three-arm randomized controlled trial with a pretest-posttest design, conducted among women in menopause. The sample included 35 participants in the EFT group, 35 in the sham group, and 35 in the control group, totaling 105 participants. The intervention was administered to the EFT and sham groups once weekly for four weeks. Data were collected using the Personal Information Form, Menopause Symptoms Rating Scale (MSRS), Menopause-Specific Quality of Life Scale (MSQLS), and Perimenopausal Depression Scale (Meno-D). Data analysis was performed using χ 2 tests, paired-samples t -tests, one-way ANOVA, and two-way mixed ANOVA for repeated measures. Results: After the intervention, statistically significant differences were observed in the mean posttest scores of the MSRS (EFT: 10.14±5.96; sham: 16.80±7.21; control: 17.74±5.79), MSQOL (EFT: 50.31±24.69; sham: 57.91±24.43; control: 75.51±24.87), and Meno-D (EFT: 7.69±5.02; sham: 13.31±7.60; control: 15.40±6.17) among the EFT, sham, and control groups ( P &lt;0.05). The EFT group had the lowest MSRS and Meno-D scores, with significant differences observed between the EFT group and both the sham and control groups ( P &lt;0.05). The EFT group also had the lowest MSQOL score, with significant differences identified between the control group and both the sham and EFT groups ( P &lt;0.05). Repeated measures analyses revealed that the time-dependent changes between groups were statistically significant ( P &lt;0.05). Conclusion: EFT can be considered an effective complementary intervention for reducing menopausal symptoms, alleviating depression, and improving quality of life in women. Incorporating low-cost and feasible techniques such as EFT into women’s health services is recommended.",

    "Abstract": "Background &amp; Aims: Metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), including its more severe form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), is increasingly recognized as a critical global health challenge. This study investigates the role of hepatic GPR75 in MASH progression. Approach &amp; Results: Although GPR75 is not abundantly expressed in the liver in healthy individuals, its protein levels significantly increase during MASH. Depletion of Gpr75 in either the whole liver or specifically in hepatocytes protected mice from diet-induced hepatic steatosis, while hepatocyte-specific overexpression of Gpr75 exacerbated diet-induced MASH and liver fibrosis. The deficiency of hepatic Gpr75 activated the GNAI2-cAMP-PKA signaling pathway in the livers of MASLD mice, reducing SREBP-1c maturation and de novo lipogenesis. Mechanistically, VPS35 stabilized GPR75 by recycling it to the hepatocyte membrane, thereby decreasing its degradation during MASH progression. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that GPR75 serves as a novel regulator of MASLD /MASH by modulating hepatic fatty acid metabolism. These findings suggest that GPR75 suppression may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for MASLD/MASH treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Disease‑modifying therapy for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains limited. The Dapagliflozin in Heart Failure with Mildly Reduced or Preserved Ejection Fraction (DELIVER) trial demonstrated the benefits of disease‑modifying therapy and outlined the eligibility criteria for this treatment. The present study investigated how often treatment eligibility changes after hospitalization for acute decompensation and whether eligibility at discharge influences 1‑year outcomes. Methods: This single-center observational cohort study included adults hospitalized for acute HFpEF (left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 50%) between January 2020 and December 2022. Elevated N‑terminal pro‑B‑type natriuretic peptide and structural heart disease (left atrial enlargement or left ventricular hypertrophy) indicated predischarge DELIVER eligibility. Eligibility was reassessed in event‑free survivors at 1-year follow-up. Primary (all-cause mortality) and secondary (cardiovascular mortality and hospitalization for heart failure [HHF]) outcomes were analyzed over a 1-year period. Kaplan–Meier and Cox analyses with stepwise adjustment were performed. Results: Of 385 patients (mean age: 83.7 ± 13.9 years; men, 53%), 79.2% were DELIVER‑eligible at discharge. Within 1 year, 41.7% of patients who were initially ineligible became eligible, and 85.4% of patients who were eligible remained eligible. The main factor contributing to these changes was progressive left atrial dilatation. Follow-up assessments revealed 35, 20, and 68 HHFs, cardiovascular deaths, and all-cause deaths, respectively. Although eligible patients exhibited high rates of crude 1-year mortality (hazard ratio: 2.43; 95% confidence interval: 1.11–5.30) and cardiovascular mortality and HHFs (hazard ratio: 2.83; 95% confidence interval: 1.13–7.09) than did ineligible patients, no differences in event-free survival rates were observed after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidities. Conclusion: Although most patients with decompensated HFpEF met the DELIVER criteria, 41.7% of initially ineligible patients became eligible after 1 year. However, no differences were observed in the adjusted 1-year rate of all-cause mortality or cardiovascular mortality and HHFs.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The lack of specific and immunocompetent gastric cancer models has hindered the exploration of gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC). We constructed a spontaneous and transplantable GAC model using a genetically engineered mouse. Methods: We generated a tamoxifen-inducible CRISPR-based Anxa10-CreERT2 mouse line and crossed it with the KrasG12D/+ and Tp53R172H/+ strains to develop Anxa10-CreERT2; KrasG12D/+; Tp53R172H/+ mice on a C57BL/6J background. Tamoxifen and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea were administered to induce in situ tumor development. An orthotopic gastric tumor was confirmed by histological analysis and positron emission tomography/computed tomography. A transplantable mouse-derived allograft (MDA) model and stable GAC cell line (ST-YC19) were subsequently established using MDA. The malignant characteristics and drug responses were evaluated. Results: Spontaneous GAC had a 100% incidence within 2.5 months, was predominantly of the intestinal type, and presented essential molecular features of the CIN subtype. The ST-YC19 GAC cell line derived from MDAs exhibited an aggressive phenotype, robust tumorigenic potential, peritoneal dissemination, and distant metastasis. This model showed limited sensitivity to anti-programmed death-1 immunotherapy. Conclusion: We successfully established a spontaneous GAC model and its corresponding cell line in C57BL/6J mice, enabling a comprehensive investigation of tumor progression, metastasis, therapeutic response, and resistance mechanisms in vivo. This model represents a valuable platform for advancing precision medicine in gastric cancer.",

This study investigates the urodynamic manifestations of LUTS in patients with LAM entheseal pain. Methods: In this retrospective cohort, women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and LUTS underwent standardized palpation and were stratified into three groups: isolated LAM muscular pain, isolated LAM entheseal pain, and combined muscular and entheseal pain. Symptom prevalence and comprehensive urodynamic parameters were compared across groups. Results: A total of 307 patients were enrolled. Enthesis-related pain groups exhibited significantly higher prevalences of urinary symptoms, including urinary frequency (muscle pain, n = 81 vs. entheseal pain, n = 32 vs. combined pain, n = 194: 82.7% vs. 87.5% vs. 85.1%, p = 0.011), residual urinary sensation (46.9% vs. 65.6% vs. 63.4%, p &lt; 0.001), and painful bladder symptoms (45.7% vs. 59.4% vs. 61.9%, p &lt; 0.001). Additionally, these groups demonstrated significantly higher rates of pain-related comorbidities, including bearing-down sensation (33.3% vs. 37.5% vs. 49.0%, p &lt; 0.001), dysmenorrhea (22.2% vs. 25.0% vs. 35.1%, p &lt; 0.001), irritable bowel syndrome (29.6% vs. 32.4% vs. 44.3%, p &lt; 0.001), and systemic myofascial pain (28.4% vs. 40.6% vs. 52.6%, p &lt; 0.001). However, direct comparison between isolated muscular and entheseal pain groups revealed no significant differences in LUTS or pain comorbidities, whereas combined pain group demonstrated the highest symptom prevalence. Notably, no significant intergroup differences were observed in urodynamic parameters. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that LAM entheseal pain represents a distinct, clinically palpable entity in CPP. The inability of urodynamic evaluation to distinguish it from myofascial pain suggests that associated LUTS may reflect a shared final pathway of central sensitization rather than peripheral structural dysfunction. Its association with morning stiffness further supports a divergent pathophysiology.",

Despite their potential to influence maternal health outcomes positively, Black fathers are typically overlooked in health care systems and maternal health research. This commentary is a call to action to stop sidelining fathers and help them help mothers. Research: Fathers can play key roles in reducing stress, supporting healthy behaviors, and advocating for care throughout the perinatal continuum. The FATHER framework aims to provide conceptual grounding for this body of work. Methods: Utilizing the theory of change framework, modified to reflect the tenets of antiracism, we employ human-centered design methods to develop community-driven strategies to decolonize maternal health care for Black families.

    "Abstract": "Objective: To compare the effectiveness of pain and bleeding control between general anesthesia alone and general anesthesia combined with cervical blockade during the loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Materials and Methods: This prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, exploratory clinical trial included 40 patients diagnosed with high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) by colposcopic biopsy. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio: the control group underwent LEEP under general anesthesia only (n = 20), and the study group received general anesthesia with additional local cervical anesthesia (n = 20). Intraoperative bleeding, pain scores, pathological specimen size, surgical margins, and postoperative complications were compared. Results: Demographic data were similarly distributed. Smoking was significantly more prevalent in the control group ( p &lt;.01). Preoperative cervical cytology, HPV DNA results, colposcopic biopsy results, and hemoglobin values were also comparable between the groups. Postoperative hemoglobin values, hemoglobin decrease, specimen size, surgical margin status, or hospital admissions after discharge were similar ( p &gt;.05). However, postoperative pain scores and intraoperative sponge usage were significantly lower in the cervical blockade group ( p &lt;.01). Subgroup analyses showed that smoking had no effect on bleeding rates as well as specimen sizes, which also did not affect bleeding rates and pain scores ( p &gt;.05). Conclusions: Cervical blockade in LEEP performed under general anesthesia significantly reduces bleeding and pain. It does not influence blood transfusions, recovery, hospital readmissions or complications. Cervical blockade may enhance patient comfort and minimize intraoperative morbidity during LEEP. These preliminary findings require confirmation in larger, multicenter, preferably blinded trials.",

    "Abstract": "Donor livers may contain occult fibrin which is associated with adverse transplant outcomes in livers donated after brain death (DBD) and circulatory death (DCD). Ex situ normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) may allow fibrinolytic therapy prior to transplantation. Before undertaking a large efficacy study for the prophylaxis of cholangiopathy, we wished to assess the safety of a protocol comprising alteplase and fresh frozen plasma (FFP), the latter as a source of plasminogen, and also to ascertain which of 4 possible treatment strategies was associated with greatest fibrin breakdown, as judged by D-dimer release. Eighty livers, 40 DBD and 40 DCD, were randomised to one of 5 groups of 16 each, receiving 10 mg or 20 mg alteplase, one or two units (250 mls) of FFP, with alteplase and FFP being delivered into either the hepatic artery cannula or portal reservoir at the start of NMP. The primary end point was bleeding post-transplant. Forty-four of 64 treated livers were transplanted, as were 12 of the 16 control livers receiving FFP alone. There was no increase in post-implant bleeding or blood transfusion requirement of any alteplase-treated liver compared to the FFP alone control group. All 4 alteplase groups were associated with more D-dimer release than the FFP alone control group; 10 mg alteplase was as effective as 20 mg, and delivery into the portal reservoir as effective as delivery into the hepatic artery cannula. The protocol achieving release of most D-dimers involved 10 mg alteplase being delivered directly into the portal reservoir containing 2 units of FFP. Portal delivery was found to be more straightforward than infusion into the hepatic artery cannula. The combination of alteplase with FFP appeared safe, with no bleeding complications.",

    "Abstract": "Phyllodes tumors (PTs) are rare fibroepithelial breast tumors, albeit clinically significant. This study was implemented to investigate the immunohistochemical (IHC) expression of cyclin D1 in PT subtypes and in metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma. Fifty-three resected cases of PT subtypes were analyzed. IHC analysis assessed the percentage of positive stromal tumor cells and the intensity of cyclin D1 staining. The score was classified as either negative, low, or high positive. Statistical analysis was implemented to evaluate the outcomes. Significant variations in scores were observed among various subtypes of PT, with cyclin D1 exhibiting positive nuclear expression in the stromal component of borderline and malignant tumors ( P =0.001). Malignant PTs also showed significantly different cyclin D1 expression compared with triple-negative metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma ( P =0.028). Tumor recurrence was significantly associated with high cyclin D1 expression ( P =0.013). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated moderate discriminatory ability, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.701 (95% CI: 0.535-0.856, P =0.023). Univariate analysis confirmed high cyclin D1 expression as a predictor of recurrence ( P =0.035). In conclusion, cyclin D1 overexpression provides insights into tumor progression and prognosis in PTs. Notably, positive cyclin D1 expression in metastatic malignant PT could be a diagnostic challenge, if not carefully considered within clinical context. Furthermore, the significant difference in cyclin D1 expression between malignant PT and triple-negative metaplastic spindle cell carcinoma highlights its potential utility in distinguishing between them.",

    "Abstract": "Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most prevalent type of hair loss. Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and their progeny play a pivotal role in hair regeneration. Pathologic modifications of those stem cells are responsible for dysregulation of hair growth and subsequently hair loss. So we aimed to study the immunohistochemical expression of sex determining region Y-box 9 (Sox9) and cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34) in androgenetic alopecia patients. This case-control study included 40 subjects: 14 males with androgenetic alopecia (AGA) and 6 females with female pattern hair loss (FPHL), in addition to 20 age, sex and site-matched healthy volunteers as a control group. All subjects were subjected to history taking followed by examination. Scalp biopsies were taken from all subjects, followed by immunohistochemical analysis to detect Sox9 and CD34 expression. It was found that CD34 was expressed in all control scalp biopsies in comparison to 60% of frontal bald skin samples of AGA patients. Similar decline in CD34 staining was observed in frontal biopsies when compared with hairy occipital skin of the same AGA patient. Sox9 was expressed with the highest intensities and percentage in all samples of frontal bald, occipital hairy together with control scalp biopsies. We concluded that the diminish in expression of CD34+ progenitor cells in the studied AGA frontal bald biopsies in addition to preserved expression of Sox9 + HFSCs could suggest that dysregulated conversion of HFSCs to progenitors may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of AGA.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Peripheral nerve block (PNB) usage in breast reconstruction (BR) improves post-operative pain with minimal risks. This study examined outcomes of patients receiving PNB for post-operative analgesia in BR. Methods: A retrospective analysis using the ACS-NSQIP database identified women that underwent BR from 2012-2021. Patients who received regional anesthesia in addition to general anesthesia were included. Patients that received other forms of anesthesia were excluded. Post-operative complications were compared between PNB and non-PNB groups, as well as among BR timing, modality, operative time and ASA class. Group differences assessed via t-tests and Fisher's Exact tests. Multivariate logistic regression assessed whether complications were independently associated with receiving PNBs. Results: Out of 25,188 patients, 9,429 patients (37.4%) received PNB for perioperative BR analgesia. Patients that received PNBs had longer operative times, more wound complications, reoperations and readmissions. PNB usage was associated with increased likelihood of SSI even when BR modality, timing, operative time and ASA classification were isolated ( p &lt;0.05). Further, sub-group analysis revealed PNB use was associated with SSI for all BR modalities and timing. Conclusions: The decision to use PNBs in BR should be made with awareness of the associated risk of increased wound complications. Despite that, benefits of PNBs may still very well outweigh these risks for all our patients. However, based on our findings we still suggest increased surveillance and more comprehensive consultation. Further research into the association of PNB usage and wound complications should be performed such that our patients can obtain maximal benefit and minimize unwanted side-effects.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Conjoint fascial sheath suspension is an effective treatment for severe congenital ptosis, but its application in young children remains debated. This study refined the technique and compared outcomes between children and adults to clarify the optimal age for its use. Methods: Patients with severe congenital ptosis and poor levator function (≤4 mm) were grouped by age: preschool (3–6 years), school-aged (7–17 years), and adult (&gt;18 years). All underwent refined conjoint fascial sheath suspension surgery and were followed for 3 years. Outcomes were compared across groups. Levator aponeurosis complex samples were analyzed histologically to evaluate collagen fiber, smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle content and assess developmental differences between children and adults. Results: Data were collected from 39 patients (50 eyes): 14 (18 eyes) in the preschool group, 15 (20 eyes) in the school-aged group, and 10 (12 eyes) in the adult group. All groups showed significant improvements in palpebral fissure height and margin reflex distance 1 ( P &lt;0.05). No significant intergroup differences were observed in palpebral fissure height change, correction rate, recurrence rate, or scleral exposure during follow-up (P&gt;0.05). Smooth muscle, collagen fiber, and skeletal muscle content in the levator complex did not vary by age ( P &gt;0.05). No complications, including trichiasis or conjunctival prolapse, occurred. Corneal fluorescein staining remained ≤1 in all patients, who also reported subjective postoperative benefits. Conclusion: Refined conjoint fascial sheath suspension provided effective and durable correction of severe congenital ptosis in children aged 3–17 years, with three-year outcomes comparable to those in adults.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Effective communication between surgeons and anesthesiologists in the operating room (OR) is essential for patient safety, but communication deficits remain a leading cause of medical errors. Methods: An anonymous, interdisciplinary online survey was conducted to assess communication in the OR at a single university hospital. The target population included all surgeons and anesthesiologists, regardless of career level (n=837). The questionnaire consisted of 28 items covering 5 thematic domains. It was distributed via email and available from January to March 2024. No incentives were provided. Data were analyzed descriptively and comparatively using the χ 2 test. Results: A total of 183 participants (55% anesthesiologists, 45% surgeons) were eligible. A desire for more or substantially more communication in the OR was expressed by 67% of respondents. Preventable incidences caused by communication deficits were reported by 65% of participants, with anesthesiologists being significantly more likely to report both. Gender-based discrimination in the OR was experienced by 36% of respondents with both anesthesiologists and female physicians being significantly more often affected. Conclusions: This interdisciplinary survey revealed communication gaps, preventable incidents linked to poor communication, and perceived gender-based discrimination between anesthesiologists and surgeons in the OR. Sixty-five percent of respondents link these deficits to preventable patient safety incidents. These results can serve as an exemplary case for similar hospital organizations or acute care settings and help promote gender equality. These findings underscore the need for respectful dialogue and strong interdisciplinary collaboration in operating rooms.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Wandering spleen is a rare condition characterized by the abnormal displacement of the spleen, which can lead to potential complications including torsion and splenomegaly. With an incidence of less than 0.2% globally, its occurrence during pregnancy is particularly uncommon. Case Presentation: We present a 25-year-old Gravida-II, Para-I female from Ethiopia, who experienced a 10-day history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, and loss of appetite. Examination revealed a tender mass in the right upper quadrant, with ultrasound confirming splenomegaly and torsion of the spleen. The spleen was located atypically in the right upper quadrant, indicating a wandering spleen. Discussion: The wandering spleen’s etiology includes congenital absence of supporting ligaments and acquired factors such as hormonal changes during pregnancy. Clinical manifestations can vary widely, complicating diagnosis, particularly during pregnancy. Imaging studies play a crucial role, and in this case, ultrasound findings were pivotal in preoperative diagnosis. Surgical intervention was necessary due to the complications of torsion. Conclusion: Wandering spleen presents significant clinical challenges, particularly in pregnant patients. Prompt diagnosis and surgical management are crucial to prevent severe outcomes. Post-splenectomy care includes vaccinations to guard against infections, underlining the importance of preventive measures following splenectomy.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction and Importance: End-stage renal disease patients rely heavily on arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) for hemodialysis access, but vascular access-related complications such as stenosis frequently compromise long-term patency. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) remains the primary intervention, yet resistant lesions pose significant clinical challenges. Case Presentation: This case report describes the use off-label of a nitinol-caged balloon (NCB) for treating refractory AVF stenosis that remains unresponsive to standard high-pressure angioplasty. An 85-year-old patient with a juxta-anastomotic stenosis underwent initial balloon dilation with conventional and drug-eluting balloons, which failed to achieve sustained patency. Subsequently, the NCB was employed, providing uniform and controlled expansion while minimizing vascular trauma. The procedure successfully resolved the stenosis, with the patient maintaining long-term fistula patency at 1-year follow-up and no complications. Clinical Discussion: The patency of an AVF is vital for dialysis patients, but stenosis and occlusion are common complications often caused by neointimal hyperplasia. Standard balloon angioplasty is the first-line treatment; however, resistant cases may benefit from high-pressure or ultra-high-pressure balloons. The NCB device has shown promise for refractory stenosis. Conclusion: These findings suggest that the NCB may offer a promising alternative for managing resistant AVF stenosis, potentially reducing restenosis rates and preserving vascular access. Further studies are warranted to validate its efficacy and safety in larger patient cohorts.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction : Visceral pentastomiasis is a poorly understood pathology. The clinical signs are nonspecific and are the result of massive infestation. Here, we report a case of visceral pentastomiasis revealed by acute intestinal obstruction. Case presentation: Visceral pentastomiasis is an uncommon parasitic infection that remains poorly characterized in clinical practice. The symptoms are usually nonspecific and tend to appear only in cases of significant parasite burden. We report a case of visceral pentastomiasis revealed by acute intestinal obstruction in a pediatric patient. Discussion: Human pentastomiasis was first described by Prunner in Cairo in 1847. Despite this early recognition, the disease remains uncommon, and our case appears to be the first reported in our institution in approximately 20 years. Diagnosis is essentially based on the morphological identification of the larvae or adult forms. In cases of acute abdomen, exploratory laparotomy may be required, providing both therapeutic benefit through removal of the parasites and definitive diagnostic confirmation. To date, surgical removal remains the mainstay of treatment, as no standardized pharmacological therapy has demonstrated consistent efficacy. Conclusion: Pentastomiasis is an uncommon parasitic infestation that can affect the peritoneum and mimic other causes of acute abdomen. This case highlights the importance of awareness regarding exposure risks, particularly the consumption of snake meat or contaminated foods. Surgical intervention remains the cornerstone of treatment, as it permits both diagnosis and effective removal of the parasites.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between palate morphology, masticatory muscle thickness, choanae structure, and sphenoidale foramina in individuals with temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD), and to determine how variations in these parameters affect temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function. Methods: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans of 36 individuals with TMD and 36 healthy controls, aged 18 to 69 years, were retrospectively analyzed. The possible relationships between TMD and the morphometry of the hard palate, nasi choanae, and sphenoidale foramina were evaluated, and thickness measurements of the masticatory muscles (masseter, temporalis, lateral, and medial pterygoideus) were also correlated with TMD. Results: Significant relationships were found between TMD and the morphometric features of the craniofacial structures. Statistically significant relationships were found between age and the masseter, temporalis, and medial pterygoid muscle thicknesses in individuals who had TMD ( P &lt;0.05). In addition, a significant difference was observed in the hard palate transverse width according to gender in the TMD group ( P &lt;0.05). In the control group, a significant relationship was found between medial pterygoid thickness on both sides and left foramen ovale length and hard palate transverse width values depending on gender ( P &lt;0.05). Significant differences were found in foramen rotundum width measurements in the comparison of the TMD and control groups ( P &lt;0.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the relationship between craniofacial morphology, masticatory muscle thickness, and TMD. The findings suggest that anatomic features of the hard palate and sphenoid region may contribute to TMJ function and deepen the understanding of TMD’s structural basis.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To assess the proportion of unresectable colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) patients meeting liver transplant (LT) criteria and define their outcomes following hepatic artery infusion pump (HAIP) chemotherapy. Summary Background Data: The TransMet RCT demonstrates improved survival with combined LT and systemic versus systemic therapy alone; however, systemic therapy might not be the best control. This study assesses outcomes in similarly selected patients treated with HAIP. Methods: We identified unresectable CRLM patients treated with HAIP between 2006-2016. Modified TransMet/SECA-II selection criteria were applied, including pre-treatment with at least 1 st line chemotherapy before HAIP placement. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods from HAIP placement. Results: Of 483 patients identified, 23 (4.8%) were LT-eligible. Median age was 52 years (range:37,73). Primary tumors were right-sided in 6 (23%) and rectal in 12 (52%). Eight (38%) patients were KRAS mut . Median CRLM size and number were 28 mm (range:9,92) and 11 (range:4,38). Median pre-HAIP chemotherapy cycles were 8 (range:3,20), and most patients were on 1 st (15,65%) or 2 nd (7,30%) line therapy. Conversion to resection occurred in 18 (78%) patients after a median of 5 (range:1,20) HAIP chemotherapy cycles. With a median follow-up time of 98 (95%CI:96,NR) months, median OS was 61 (95%CI:36,92) months, and 5-year OS was 53% (95%CI:36,79). Median PFS was 13 (95%CI:10,22) months. Conclusions: In this cohort, less than 5% of unresectable CRLM patients were LT-eligible. After treatment with HAIP chemotherapy, overall 5-year survival was 53%, similar to a recent LT randomized trial (5-year OS 57%).",

    "Abstract": "Bradyrhizobial strains nodulate the native legume Cytisus supranubius ( Genisteae ) in its natural habitat: the high-mountain ecosystem of Tenerife (Canary Islands), where nitrogen fixation is an essential activity in its N-poor soils. Three of these strains, SSUT18 T , SSUT77 and SSUT112, are representative of a major phylotype within the genus Bradyrhizobium, and the phylogenetic analysis of their 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that Bradyrhizobium canariense is their closest relative. Nevertheless, the multilocus sequence analysis and the genome analysis distinguished these strains from the type strain of B. canariense and from the remaining species of the genus Bradyrhizobium . The calculated Average Nucleotide Identity (blast) (ANIb) and digital DNA–DNA hybridization values between the genomes of the strains from the new species and B. canariense were also lower than the threshold values proposed for species differentiation. These data, together with differences observed in chemotaxonomic and phenotypic characteristics, support the classification of the strains SSUT18 T , SSUT77 and SSUT112 into a new species of Bradyrhizobium , for which we propose the name Bradyrhizobium nivariense sp. nov.

    "Abstract": "Purpose 4D textiles are created through 3D printing on pre-stressed textiles. The flexible textiles generate tension during the printing process, while the 3D-printed structure acts as a reinforcement, storing this tension within the material. These components undergo state transitions in response to external stimuli. In such cases, it is essential to ensure that the printed elements remain reliably bonded to the textile substrate and do not delaminate. Therefore, the interface between the 3D-printed structure and the textile property plays a crucial role. In order to solve this potential problem and reduce material and time consumption in the experimental phase, a systematic investigation of adhesion performance is necessary. Design/methodology/approach This study systematically examines the key parameters influencing adhesion at this interface, including textile type, printing parameters, printed materials and pre-tensioning. A comprehensive 2ˆn factorial experimental design was employed to analyse the interactions between these parameters. Adhesion strength was evaluated using 180° peel tests. Mathematical evaluation methods, including Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), effect calculation and confidence interval analysis, are applied to systematically assess the influence of each factor. The evaluation is performed using an organized results table, which simplifies the analysis process and facilitates the interpretation of significant effects and interactions. Findings In this study, nine factors influencing interfacial adhesion in 4D textiles were analysed using a 2ˆn factorial design. Key findings show that nozzle distance critically affects adhesion, with 0.05 mm being optimal. Higher textile pre-tension reduced adhesion, while lower pre-tension enabled 4D shape transformation. Nozzle temperature significantly influenced adhesion, with 220 °C optimal for PLA. Textile structure was also critical: dual tricot fabrics with elastane improved mechanical interlocking. The interaction between pre-tension and textile type also affects adhesion. Material choice affected adhesion, with silicone rubber achieving the highest values. In contrast, mesh orientation, printing speed and bed temperature showed no significant effects within the tested ranges. Originality/value The findings of this study provide a systematic analysis of interfacial adhesion, supporting the efficient production of 4D textiles and 3D-printed structures on textile substrates. By applying the identified key parameters, strong adhesion can be achieved without repeated trial-and-error testing, ensuring structural integrity for repeated state transformations in 4D textiles. Additionally, improved process reliability contributes to more sustainable manufacturing by reducing material waste and the need for auxiliary bonding agents. These insights enhance the robustness and scalability of 4D-textile production and open new application possibilities in wearable electronics, soft robotics and adaptive architectural structures.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This research integrates cue utilization and psychological reactance to explore the impact of relative platform score (RPS), calculated as perceived platform score minus objective platform-generated score, on individuals’ behavioral intentions. Specifically, we examine how trial intention mediates the influence of RPS on recommendation intention. Additionally, we investigate the moderating role of proactivity in the relationship between RPS and trial intention. Design/methodology/approach Utilizing survey data from 359 sample customers who had utilized Chinese third-party review platforms, hierarchical and path analyses were conducted to analyze whether and how RPS positively impacts both trial intention and recommendation intention. Moreover, “PROCESS SPSS Macro” was used to test the mediating role of trial intention and the moderated mediation effect with proactivity as moderator. Findings Our findings indicate that RPS positively impacts both trial intention and recommendation intention, with the influence on recommendation intention being mediated by trial intention. Moreover, proactivity positively moderates the relationship between RPS and trial intention, thereby enhancing the indirect influence of RPS on recommendation intention through trial intention. Originality/value By elucidating the effect of RPS on behavioral intentions through the underlying mechanism of psychological reactance, we extend the existing research stream on third-party platform rating scores. Furthermore, we contribute novel insights to the research on proactivity by examining its moderating role in the relationship between RPS and trial intention.",

Organizational management performance was visually portrayed, current status assessment tools were provided and a basis for future management was provided. Design/methodology/approach Based on literature research, the relationship between organization management and OHW was investigated by the person-environment-occupation-performance model and the driving force-pressure-state-impact-response model. The mechanism was elucidated using the geo-detector and coupling coordination degree methods. In addition, a method was constructed based on data envelopment analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of management. Findings There was an upward trend in OHW promotion over the four quarters, especially in the fourth quarter (Q4) for the J project. Organizational resources, job autonomy control, stress related to responsibility and performance and intervention forms were identified as the dominant factors affecting OHW. The coupling relationship between the factors was revealed. In Q4, the average comprehensive, technical and scale efficiencies were 0.77, 0.82 and 0.94, respectively. It was mainly the technical efficiency that determined the trend of comprehensive efficiency. Research limitations/implications This study focuses on the project of one enterprise as a case study, and the data may be sparse. In the future, efforts can be made to broaden the source of the sample to include different enterprises in different geographic locations to deepen the analyses. Secondly, the integration of data measured by wearable devices will be considered in the assessment of OHW. Moreover, it can provide more guidance for management. Practical implications With the establishment of quality-based assessment tools, new insights can be gained for measuring costs and benefits. This evaluation provides incentives for activities and changes the bias that regards interventions as unnecessary investment costs. This study focused on a creative new perspective of “efficiency” and proposed a novel evaluation model. It covers the “input-output” cycle in the system, reflecting the coordinated development and grasping the dynamic changes. In addition, a cycle will generate the response plan for the next cycle of input, as much as possible to reflect the “input-output” lag of the system. Social implications By focusing on the health and well-being of this large group of workers, the healthcare burden can be reduced and production and economic functioning can be ensured. It is also one of the national strategic goals in the context of China's modernization. It is the necessary support for healthy work organization and harmonious social development. Originality/value This study contributes to stress, health and well-being management, improving satisfaction and promoting performance. Importantly, it has innovative value and practical significance in constructing and consolidating the whole chain of OHW promotion, including leading factors, driving mechanisms, evaluation methods and sustainability. In the Healthy China strategy context, this study develops new perspectives and evaluation methods but also draws managerial-oriented conclusions.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the onset of convection in microelectronics cooling in a trapezoidal thermal system saturated with a H2O based Ag-MgO (50-50%) binary hybrid nanofluid via stream function-vorticity (ψ-ζ) analysis and numerical simulation. Design/methodology/approach A uniformly heated block is positioned in the middle of the trapezoidal system. The block is considered in three different sizes, measured by aspect ratios of 25%, 50% and 75% of the trapezium height. The flow transport in the domain is magnetically controlled. The governing formulas are solved by using a fourth-order accurate compact finite difference scheme, which captures flow physics on low computational grids with high spatial resolution. Findings Quantitatively, the maximum heat transfer enhancement is achieved at AR = 0.75 and γ=75°, with corresponding increases in average Nusselt number (Nuav) ranging from 9.5% to 34.12% at Ra = 104, 8.43% to 29.78% at Ra = 105 and 7.27% to 35.21% at Ra = 106. The results reveal that the heated block significantly alters the thermal and flow structure, especially under higher Rayleigh numbers and inclined boundary configurations. These outcomes offer promising implications for real-world applications requiring efficient thermal management within confined enclosures. Originality/value This work’s originality is found in five key areas: the role of hybrid nanofluids with experimental correlations, the geometrical effects of the trapezoidal cavity, the influence of heated block aspect ratios (0.25 ≤ AR ≤ 0.75), the interaction with applied magnetic fields, and the implementation of higher-order compact computational techniques over a wide range of parameters.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to examine how home demands and resources shape work engagement and job performance, and investigate the moderating role of online leisure engagement. Grounded in the work–home resources (WH-R) model, this study incorporates nontraditional home dynamics and digital leisure to advance a cross-domain perspective on employee resource processes. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a diary study with 45 hospitality employees, who provided data twice weekly over four consecutive weeks (360 observations). We measured home demands, home resources, work engagement and job performance daily and assessed online leisure engagement as a general factor. Findings Work engagement fully mediates the relationships between home demands/resources and job performance. Online leisure engagement buffers the negative effect of home demands on work engagement and strengthens the positive relationship between work engagement and job performance. Practical implications Hospitality organizations can sustain employees’ engagement and performance by adopting flexible, family-supportive practices and recognizing online leisure as a legitimate recovery behavior that helps buffer home-related strain. Originality/value This study extends understanding of how home demands and home resources shape daily work engagement and, in turn, job performance. It also extends the WH-R model by illustrating how online leisure engagement can function as a cross-domain, behavioral moderator that operates beyond traditional resource classifications. By integrating off-job digital leisure into daily work–home processes, this study offers a contemporary and inclusive framework for understanding how home experiences are translated into work engagement and job performance by showing the underappreciated role of nonwork digital leisure in sustaining performance in hospitality work.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to explore the wellbeing of undocumented Nepalese immigrants in Portugal, focusing on the impacts of “illegalization” on their lives and how they navigate structural violence through the mobilization of social capital. It aims to explore various wellbeing dimensions – living environment, physical health, economic stability and emotional, social and spiritual wellbeing – identifying key factors that may mitigate or exacerbate these challenges. Design/methodology/approach Using qualitative methods, data were collected through semi-structured interviews, participant observation, key information interviews and field note analysis. The study sample includes 13 undocumented Nepalese immigrants, 15 documented immigrants and four representatives from supporting organizations. A comparative analysis highlights differences in wellbeing between documented and undocumented groups. Findings Results indicate that undocumented Nepalese immigrants experienced lower overall wellbeing than documented counterparts, consistent with prior research. However, the study finds that robust social capital within the Nepalese communities significantly aided participants by providing access to housing, employment and emotional support, helping to counterbalance some of the adverse effects associated with undocumented status. Originality/value This study contributes to social work and migration studies by emphasizing the critical role of social capital in supporting the wellbeing of undocumented Nepalese immigrants in Portugal. Findings suggest actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners to better support them, offering broader implications for social care in vulnerable migrant populations.",

The study focused on identifying the role of career navigation, career resilience and perceived employability in determining thriving at work, i.e. well-being faced by gig workers. The authors try to understand how these lead to sustainable careers, which are happy, healthy and productive employees. Design/methodology/approach The study used a mixed-methods design. The first quantitative study used a self-administered questionnaire circulated via social networks to get responses from contingent workers, gig workers and on-call workers from India. The second qualitative study used the interview methods, where knowledge workers shared their insights to highlight the inhibitors and strategies for successful career navigation. Findings The data analysis of 215 gig-workers showed the positive impact of career navigation on resilience, career navigation on thriving at work and resilience on thriving at work. Resilience also mediated the relationship between career navigation and thriving at work, and the moderation effect of perceived employability on the relationship between career navigation, resilience and thriving at work. The 23 in-depth interviews denote gig-workers on lack of experience, gendered advantage/disadvantage, location disadvantage and financial ambiguity as inhibitors for successful career navigation; agility and flexibility, continuous learning, entrepreneur mindset, developing social network and digital networking and being resource-intensive as strategies for successful career navigation.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to investigate the role of ta’awun ambidexterity, a new construct based on Islamic principles of collaboration, in improving business performance within Islamic organizations. It specifically examines how organizational culture, including market, clan and adhocracy cultures, influences ta’awun exploitation and exploration, and how these, in turn, affect business performance. This study introduces the concept of ta’awun ambidexterity, which uniquely integrates Islamic ethics with contemporary organizational ambidexterity theory. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research design was used, using structural equation modeling with AMOS 24.0. This study surveyed 250 leaders of Muhammadiyah-owned enterprises (Amal Usaha Muhammadiyah [AUM]) in East Java, Indonesia. The research framework was built on organizational learning theory and integrated with Islamic business ethics. The constructs were adapted from the established literature, with ta’awun ambidexterity operationalized using newly validated Islamic business behavior indicators. Findings The findings show that all three cultural dimensions significantly influence ta’awun’s ambidexterity. Market and clan cultures have a strong positive effect on both ta’awun exploitation and exploration. Adhocracy culture significantly affects ta’awun exploration and has a marginal effect on ta’awun exploitation. Furthermore, both ta’awun ambidexterity dimensions significantly contribute to improved business performance. Research limitations/implications This study is limited to Muhammadiyah-owned enterprises in East Java, Indonesia, which may affect the generalizability of the findings to other types of Islamic organizations or regions. The study’s implications suggest that spiritually grounded cooperation can enhance innovation and resource optimization in Islamic organizational settings. This study provides an empirical basis for developing strategic policies for Islamic organizations to reinforce the synergy between adaptive work cultures and Islamic values. Originality/value This study introduces and defines ta’awun ambidexterity as a novel construct, merging Islamic ethics with contemporary organizational theory. By embedding values such as mutual assistance, trust and shared purpose, it offers a distinct perspective on how Islamic organizations can enhance their competitiveness while adhering to their spiritual mission. This study bridges the gap between spirituality and managerial rationality in value-based organizational governance.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Using social identity theory, this study aims to examine the impact of education and attitudes toward the LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) community on consumers’ attitudes and behaviours in response to LGBTQ-inclusive hospital ads. Design/methodology/approach An online experiment compares responses to hospital ads featuring or not featuring an indicator of LGBTQ-inclusiveness to assess purchase intentions while accounting for the moderation of education level and attitudes toward the LGBTQ community. While previous LGBTQ-inclusive advertising research included visuals of LGBTQ people, this study uses an ad that includes a succinct textual message of inclusiveness along with a pride flag. A total of 250 participants recruited via Amazon MTurk completed a set of questions after viewing the ad online. Hypotheses were tested using the PROCESS macros. Findings Level of education moderates the relationship between LGBTQ-inclusive (neutral) ads and purchase intention such that purchase intention increases (decreases) for more- (less-) educated consumers. Less-educated people with more (less) positive attitudes toward the LGBTQ community have higher purchase intentions when exposed to an LGBTQ-inclusive ad than when exposed to a neutral ad. Originality/value This study is the first to explore the effects of LGBTQ-inclusive hospital advertising that uses an LGBTQ-inclusive message without the use of LGBTQ people in the ad and to study the moderation of education and attitude toward the LGBTQ community on the effectiveness of LGBTQ-inclusive hospital ads. According to our findings, to enhance purchase intentions, hospitals’ LGBTQ-inclusive advertisements should target either more educated consumers or less educated consumers who have positive attitudes toward the LGBTQ community.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Higher education institutions (HEIs) are unique organizations, given their missions and leadership role in sustainable development. However, they face challenges similar to those of other organizations, such as surviving in an increasingly competitive environment. In this context, the purpose of this study is to propose a model for applying corporate sustainability (CS)-related concepts to HEIs, taking into account their unique characteristics. Design/methodology/approach Given the numerous, often inconsistently defined concepts linking organizations with sustainability, this study reviews the literature on corporate social responsibility, CS and corporate governance for sustainability. Furthermore, this study applies a systematic literature review to the triple bottom line and environmental, social and governance (ESG) concepts. The goal is to identify their meanings and how they can compose a model suitable for HEIs. Findings The proposed model argues that corporate social responsibility, represented by the Sustainable Development Goals, and CS, represented by the new concept of the triple bottom line plus governance, can be jointly applied by HEIs. Practical implications The model is expected to facilitate the holistic integration of sustainability by HEIs, helping them overcome several barriers. It can assist these institutions in capacity and strategic planning programs, as well as in structuring sustainability initiatives. Moreover, the model is believed to be adaptable for other organizations.

    "Abstract": "Purpose It is often assumed that households that hire a domestic worker pay low and insecure wages. Given the high incidence of undeclared work in the sector, reliable insights into the wages that households pay in practice remain scarce. This study contributes to the literature by describing the wages that households pay to domestic workers and by identifying sources of wage differences across households. To provide a complete description of wages, we ask what household pay per hour (hourly wages) and whether they continue wage payments during cancellations (wage security). To identify sources of differences in hourly wages and wage security, we consider characteristics of households, workers and their relationships. Design/methodology/approach The study draws on survey data collected among a representative sample of Dutch households in October 2023, providing data on 440 households that hire a domestic worker. Findings Results show that most households pay above minimum wage and that few households provide wage security. Hourly wages are associated with household income, household composition and domestic workers’ age and ethnic background. Wage security is associated with household income and the length of the relationship between households and domestic workers. Originality/value Findings suggest that it is worthwhile to distinguish between hourly wages and wage security, as both are substantively different things. This has implications for policymakers that seek to improve the position of domestic workers.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The aim of this study is to address the research gap in understanding the role of AI in the workplace, particularly by investigating how AI fosters job anxiety. By introducing the transactional theory of stress and coping (TTSC), this study engages with the conventional theory of stress and anxiety to determine the dual role of AI features in both exacerbating and alleviating job anxiety. Design/methodology/approach A large-scale survey was conducted, and 675 valid responses were collected. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was employed to analyze the entire theoretical model. A bootstrapping analysis was applied to assess the serial mediating role of AI stress in linking AI features to job anxiety. Findings The results revealed that AI explainability significantly enhances job anxiety. Conversely, algorithm transparency emerges as a mitigating factor, reducing job anxiety. These findings underscore the dual impact of AI, which acts as both a stressor and a potential alleviator depending on its design characteristics. Research implications This study highlights that algorithmic transparency can effectively mitigate AI-induced stress and job anxiety, underscoring the need for firms and managers to implement AI cautiously while strengthening governance merchanisms and prioritizing employee well-being and skill development. AI developers and policymakers should advance human-centered transparency and regulatory safeguards to reduce workplace anxiety and protect employees in AI-enabled environments. Originality/value This study pioneers a focus on the complex effects of AI in the workplace, diverging from conventional research that predominantly emphasizes the supportive role of AI. By integrating the TTSC, this study theoretically advances the understanding of AI stress mechanisms and empirically demonstrates the paradoxical effects of AI features. The dual-role framework offers novel insights for both academics and practitioners in addressing AI-related workplace challenges.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Robot demonstration data is of great significance for enhancing robot autonomy through data-driven methods such as imitation learning. High-quality robot data is mainly obtained through teleoperation. However, current teleoperation methods either have high costs, poor usability or insufficient support for wheeled humanoid robots. This paper aims to design a low-cost wheeled-humanoid robot teleoperation system to address the above problems. Design/methodology/approach Our teleoperation system only uses one camera and one microphone to ensure low cost. It includes a fiducial-marker-based dual-arm manipulation module for the teleoperation of robot arms, a human-pose-based locomotion piloting module for the teleoperation of the robot locomotion, a voice command control module for gripper control and mode switching and an error-enhanced imitation learning module to train robot’s policy. Findings A robot teleoperation system with extremely low cost is constructed, which combines vision and voice to enhance usability. Sufficient experiments show that, in various tasks, with just one operator, the proposed system can efficiently teleoperate the wheeled-humanoid robot, collect high-quality data and train imitation learning policies. Originality/value A low-cost vision-voice teleoperation system for wheeled-humanoid robots is proposed, which is of great significance for the scalable demonstration data collection and robot imitation learning research.",

Robustness is confirmed through fully modified ordinary least squares and dynamic ordinary least squares, complemented by diagnostic and stability tests. The study adopts the Toda–Yamamoto Granger noncausality test to test the causality between the variables as a final test to enrich the outcomes. Findings Results indicate that entrepreneurship (ENT), financial development (FD) and labor force participation (LAB) increase inequality in the long run, while economic growth, trade openness (TO) and human capital (HC) reduce disparities (GINI). In the short run, GDP growth and human capital act as strong equalizers, whereas entrepreneurship exerts only a weak effect. These findings suggest that without equity safeguards, entrepreneurial and financial growth disproportionately benefit wealthier groups. Research limitations/implications The study relies on national data, which may obscure regional variations and differences between necessity- and opportunity-driven entrepreneurship. Practical implications Equitable micro, small and medium enterprise financing, digital integration, vocational education and labor protections are essential to make entrepreneurial and financial development more inclusive. Social implications Strengthening inclusive entrepreneurship, equitable financial systems and human capital investment will help Indonesia achieve sustainable, socially equitable growth toward Vision 2045. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the paper provides one of the first Indonesia-specific long-term time-series assessments of the entrepreneurship–inequality nexus. By integrating multiple macroeconomic drivers, it offers original empirical insights for balancing growth and equity in an emerging economy.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to develop a structured decision-support framework to prioritize Industry 4.0 technologies (I4.0Ts) for reverse logistics operations in perishable-goods supply chains. These supply chains face unique challenges, including product perishability, unpredictable return flows, and the need for real-time monitoring and sustainability. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method approach was adopted, combining a systematic literature review with expert validation to define relevant evaluation criteria based on the Technology–Organization–Environment (TOE) framework, which was extended to include scalability and social acceptance dimensions. The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) was used to weight five main and 14 sub-criteria, and the Fuzzy TOPSIS (FTOPSIS) was applied to rank four I4.0Ts: IoT, Blockchain, AGVs, and Big Data. Findings The results reveal that cost-effectiveness, scalability, and technological feasibility are the most influential criteria in technology selection. Among the evaluated alternatives, IoT and Blockchain emerged as the top-ranked technologies due to their strong alignment with the needs for traceability, monitoring, and operational responsiveness in perishable reverse logistics. Originality/value This study proposes a comprehensive, criteria-driven framework specifically for evaluating and prioritizing I4.0Ts in the context of reverse logistics for perishable goods. It contributes to the literature by integrating the TOE framework with fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods, providing actionable insights for technology selection in complex, time-sensitive supply chains.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to examine the threshold effect of financial development on sectoral efficiency using 42 African countries from 2000 to 2020. Design/methodology/approach The paper used the panel threshold regression estimation. To measure financial development, the paper used domestic credit to private sector and bank deposits to GDP. Findings The findings showed that the effect of financial development on sectoral efficiency depends on the measure of financial development. Domestic credit and bank deposits have a positive linear effect on the efficiency of the manufacturing sector. Domestic credit has a U-shaped relationship with agriculture technical efficiency, but its relationship with the service sector is inverted U-shaped. This study makes some significant contributions. Bank deposits drive efficiency but beyond a certain level, the effect is not significant. Practical implications It is recommended that domestic credit to the private sector beyond 8.0976% is good for agriculture technical efficiency, while domestic credit below 11.1906% is needed for service sector efficiency. Also, threshold values below 25.9713% and 14.8981% are recommended to see a significant positive effect of bank deposits on efficiency (agriculture and service sectors, respectively). Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to consider the threshold effect of financial development on sectoral efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to examine the direct and indirect relationships between Islamic leadership (IL) and employee Islamic performance (EIP) through Islamic work ethic (IWE), Islamic work motivation (IWM) and organizational commitment (OC) in the context of Indonesia’s Islamic banking sector. Grounded in the principles of amanah (trust), adl (justice), shura (consultation), and taqwa (piety), the study seeks to provide empirical evidence on the mechanisms through which leadership values rooted in Shariah contribute to employee outcomes. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach was employed using partial least squares structural equation modeling to analyze data from 364 employees of major Islamic banks in Indonesia. The model tested both direct paths and mediating effects involving IL, IWE, IWM, OC and EIP. Reliability, validity and model fit were assessed to ensure robustness. Findings IL has a significant positive effect on EIP, both directly and indirectly, through IWM and OC. By contrast, the mediating role of IWE was found to be nonsignificant. These results confirm that while Islamic ethical values are important, their impact on performance is most strongly realized when reinforced by leadership-driven motivation and commitment. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to Indonesia’s Islamic banking sector, which may affect generalizability. Future studies could expand to other cultural or institutional contexts and use qualitative methods to capture deeper insights into IL processes. Practical implications The findings suggest that Islamic banks should strengthen leadership development and human resource management (HRM) programs that emphasize amanah, adl, shura and taqwa. Focusing on enhancing motivation and OC is particularly critical to translating leadership values into sustainable performance outcomes. Originality/value This research offers a novel empirical framework linking IL with key organizational outcomes. It extends the literature on Islamic organizational behavior by demonstrating the pathways through which spiritual leadership values drive motivation, commitment and ethical performance in financial institutions.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The increasing importance of knowledge management systems (KMS) as a source of competitive advantage and the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) makes the question of appropriate integration of AI and human intelligence (HI) in KMS very pertinent. This paper aims to develop a framework that helps identify appropriate AI-HI integration in KMS for different structure, content and context-related parameters. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses an inductive approach that leverages Shneiderman (2020) framework to develop a hierarchical framework demonstrating the level of sophistication of AI and identifies an appropriate level for a firm given its structure, content and context-related characteristics. Findings The absent, assistive, augmented and automated (4A) model of AI integration has been developed, and the relevant structure, content and context-related variables of KMS have been identified. Using the 4A model, the appropriate AI level for an organization, considering multiple structure, content and context-related parameters is identified. Based on the model, efficiency and control are identified as the two principal objectives of KMS and the trade-off between them is elucidated. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper develops a new model to determine the appropriate level of AI and human interaction in KMS and demonstrates its applicability in multiple situations.

    "Abstract": "Purpose Integrating complementarity and network theories, this study advances an integrative model that explains how perceived management support enhances inbound open innovation outcomes through realized absorptive capacity. The author posits that while internal support systems and external network structures serve as complementary drivers, their synergistic effect depends critically on a firm’s ability to move beyond knowledge acquisition to the assimilation and exploitation of external knowledge. This model clarifies the underlying pathways through which internal support structures and network-enabled knowledge complementarities jointly foster inbound open innovation. Design/methodology/approach The author analyzed survey data from middle- and senior-level managers in the UAE using a multimethod approach. Structural equation modeling tested the core hypothesized relationships, while fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) identified the sufficient configurations of conditions for enhanced inbound open innovation across varying market orientations. Findings The results show that perceived management support does not directly affect inbound open innovation. Instead, realized absorptive capacity fully mediates this relationship, emphasizing its critical role in translating managerial support into innovation outcomes. The fsQCA results further identify multiple equifinal configurations through which firms achieve strong inbound open innovation, contingent upon market orientation profiles. Originality/value This study contributes to knowledge management and open innovation literature by integrating structural and configurational perspectives to explain how internal support mechanisms and knowledge capabilities interact to enhance external knowledge integration. It extends the understanding of absorptive capacity as a strategic conduit through which managerial support is converted into innovation performance. For practitioners, the study offers actionable insights on how to enhance internal learning and absorptive capacity to maximize the benefits of open innovation initiatives under varying market conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to map and quantify recent developments in research on corporate governance and digital transformation, by emphasizing the knowledge management challenges. The study provides responses to three research questions: How has scientific production and citation impact evolved in corporate governance and digital transformation? Which authors, journals and countries form the knowledge base and collaboration networks of the field? What themes and emerging topics are shaping future research trajectories and knowledge management challenges? Design/methodology/approach A total of 112 peer-reviewed articles from Scopus were collected covering the period 2018–2025. Following the removal of duplicates and the clarification of the author/institution, a two-stage analysis was performed with Bibliometrix/Biblioshiny 5.0.1. The two stages of the analysis were as follows: (1) citation productivity and performance; (2) scientific mapping (co-citation, bibliographic coupling, co-words and thematic-evolutionary analyses). Findings The findings of the study demonstrated a significant increase in the annual scientific output, with an average growth of 42.6% being observed. A number of high-frequency keywords have been identified, including innovation, ownership, performance, governance and big data within the scope of management studies. Thematic mapping reveals four main themes: (i) environmental, social and governance (ESG)-oriented governance, (ii) digital transformation capabilities, (iii) agency cost reduction and (iv) risk-adjusted performance. A cluster in formation on artificial intelligence-based board analysis shows the highest centrality-density trajectory, signaling an emerging research frontier. Originality/value Overall, the analysis highlights the shifting focus of investors, regulators and managers towards digital disclosure of ESG information. It is suggested that boards which adopt data-driven monitoring and address knowledge management challenges via dynamic capabilities can capture innovation rents. It is incumbent upon researchers to integrate coupling-based methods to track these rapidly evolving topics and upon managers and policymakers worldwide to strategically integrate novel developments.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Power relations within entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs) are crucial for fostering cooperation among entrepreneurs and ecosystem actors and driving local development and economic advancement. This study examines the social position and marginality of migrant entrepreneurs, a significant yet often overlooked group in traditional entrepreneurship discourse. It explores how power relations and differences manifest in migrant entrepreneurs' founding processes and how they address emerging challenges. Design/methodology/approach This qualitative case study uses field and practice angles on power theory to explore the marginalisation of migrant entrepreneurs in a German Ruhr Area city with a history of immigration. Pairing deductive and inductive principles, the analysis of 23 in-depth interviews explores the many faces of power for migrant entrepreneurs and how they are dealt with. Findings The study identifies three key areas – knowledge, language competence and network affiliation – that shape power relations for marginalised entrepreneurs and influence their perceptions, behaviours and outcomes. Addressing these areas is crucial for creating more equitable and sustainable EEs. Despite structural disadvantages, migrant entrepreneurs use their agency to bridge divides and balance power differences within EEs. Originality/value This research develops a power- and hierarchy-informed lens for entrepreneurship and EEs, drawing on existing power theories from other social science disciplines. It highlights the significance of studying “socio-cultural outsiders” in entrepreneurship and reveals how friction, imbalance and dysfunctionality arise within EEs as inherently social and stratified contexts and how minoritised entrepreneurs cope.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to investigate a less studied but strategically important behavior for managing brand reputation: consumer silence in response to brand crises. Design/methodology/approach The study used three scenario-based experiments to test the main effect, moderation effect and mediation mechanisms. ANOVA was used for analysis of the data. Findings During a brand crisis, consumers could prefer to remain silent over positive or negative word of mouth. Their responses are mediated by pride and shame, and psychological ownership weakens the negative spill-over effects across value based and functional based crises. Research limitations/implications This study provides fresh perspectives on passive consumer responses: silence during brand crises. It highlights the necessity of further studies that examine silence in a variety of cultural contexts and brand categories. It integrates psychological constructs such as pride, shame and ownership to consumer responses to brand crises. Practical implications Nurturing psychological ownership among consumers can help brands manage crises more effectively by encouraging consumer silence. Social implications Fostering silence among consumers can help shape responsible brand communication strategies and build resilient consumer–brand relationships. Originality/value This study broadens the view that predominantly restricted the consumer response to brand crises to advocacy or resistance by exploring and explaining the mechanisms of consumer silence as a response to brand crises with basis in self-congruence theory.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The innovative crypto-world represents one of the most prominent manifestations of volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environments. In this context, the use of technology plays a fundamental role in ensuring the survival of firms operating within the business environment. Recently, the cryptocurrency derivatives market reached a monthly trading volume of $1.33 trillion, exceeding traditional spot markets and creating unprecedented challenges for digital asset exchanges in managing investment decisions. This paper presents a novel gate-based artificial intelligence (AI) framework for optimizing cryptocurrency derivative investment strategies in crypto-exchange companies’ operations through the implementation of new technology-based solutions. Design/methodology/approach The paper is supported by the quantitative methodology of system dynamics (SD). This method allows the development of a mathematical model that integrates sentiment analysis with technical momentum indicators through a cascade gate system. The mathematical formulation includes stochastic differential equations for price dynamics, Bayesian inference for sentiment analysis and multi-objective optimization for risk management. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the framework’s robustness across different market conditions, with Sharpe ratios consistently above 1.8. Findings The framework returns a complex decision-making output in order to reach an optimal choices pathway for derivative investments. The framework matches leading indicators relative strength index, lagging indicators (moving averages, moving average convergence/divergence [MACD]) and volume indicators on-balance volume with real-time sentiment analysis. Our computational implementation uses historical data from major cryptocurrency exchanges (2020–2024) to validate the theoretical model, achieving risk-adjusted returns of 23.7% annually with maximum drawdown limited to 8.2%. Research limitations/implications The present research is not without limitations. Among others, these include the appropriate software for the effective development of SD; information asymmetry that may arise during sentiment analysis via social networks; and the real-time availability of price and volume data for the optimal consideration of technical indicators. Practical implications From a practical perspective, the work can contribute to improving decision-making and risk management assessment based on integrated approaches that combine business choices with mathematical models and the development of enabling technologies such as AI. Moreover, this research can be useful to develop an updated regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies investments. This research addresses the critical make-or-buy decision facing cryptocurrency exchanges, providing a systematic approach to in-house derivative investment management with built-in risk controls and regulatory compliance features. Social implications From a social perspective, this study contributes to a better knowledge of the behavior of crypto-exchanges in the formulation that guides them in their choice regarding investments in derivatives. This aspect now involves millions of users globally. Originality/value This study contributes to several streams of research, including the decision-making process, risk management assessment and financial instruments. The paper also presents social and practical implications.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study examines how rider-generated app store reviews serve as recruitment signals in the gig economy and how their meanings vary across algorithmic governance architectures, shaping platform attractiveness among potential delivery riders. Design/methodology/approach Using 273,460 reviews (2017–2025) from China's delivery-rider apps, the research relates review-derived work-experience signals to daily app downloads, treated as a proxy for early-stage attraction. Drawing on signaling theory and an adapted Attraction–Selection–Attrition (ASA) lens, this paper conceptualizes platform–signal fit as the alignment between governance-produced work-experience cues and how prospective riders plausibly decode those cues under uncertainty. Work-experience topics are extracted from rider reviews via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), attraction-sensitive associations are estimated using quantile regressions, topics are consolidated into four signal dimensions (Perceived Efficiency, Autonomy, Economic Return, and Algorithmic Risk Transparency) through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and a modified Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied to translate cross-quantile regularities into prioritized human resource management (HRM) guidance. Findings Findings reveal the cross-architecture asymmetries. Perceived Efficiency is negatively associated with attraction on batch-order platforms but positively associated on point-to-point platforms, indicating semantic bifurcation. Algorithmic Risk Transparency is positively associated across architectures and is most concentrated under mainstream (mid-quantile) attraction conditions. Originality/value The study contributes a theory-consistent, non-causal mapping of platform–signal fit and a replicable workflow for converting review-based signals into testable, segment-sensitive recruitment interventions.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to investigate whether the presence of women in three senior positions – chairperson, chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO) – improves or impairs corporate investment efficiency in European listed firms. It also examines whether any gender effect differs between over- and under-investment and during the 2012 sovereign-debt crisis. Design/methodology/approach Using 11,730 firm-year observations from 14 EU countries (2012–2018), the paper models expected investment with a modified Biddle et al. (2009) specification and measures inefficiency as the absolute residual (positive = over-investment; negative = under-investment). Panel regressions with industry- and year-fixed effects relate inefficiency to gender dummies for chairperson, CEO and CFO and a crisis interaction. Robustness checks exclude French firms, add equity-ownership dummies and track year-to-year gender changes. Findings Women in executive roles enhance investment efficiency: a female CEO significantly reduces both over- and under-investment. In contrast, a female chairperson (non-executive) is associated with lower efficiency, driven by a propensity to over-invest. Gender effects are stronger for over-investment than under-investment, supporting the view that female executives curb empire-building incentives. During the 2012 crisis the presence of women in top management is linked to higher inefficiency, suggesting crisis-specific constraints may offset their normally positive influence. All results remain robust to alternative samples, equity-ownership splits and gender-turnover tests. Research limitations/implications The relatively small proportion of female top managers (approximately 3%–6%) limits statistical power and external validity. Results cover European Union (EU) firms in 2012–2018; effects may differ in other regions or regulatory settings. Practical implications Regulators and boards aiming for better capital allocation may achieve more by promoting gender diversity in executive, rather than purely supervisory, posts. Quotas that focus only on-board seats risk unintended efficiency losses if women are channelled mainly into non-executive roles. Social implications Demonstrating performance benefits from female executives reinforces the business case for dismantling barriers to women’s career progression and supports EU policy initiatives to widen the talent pool. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first large-scale European evidence that distinguishes between executive and non-executive female leadership when linking gender diversity to investment efficiency and that separately analyses over- versus under-investment and crisis periods.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Due to the increasing automation requirements for robotic welding, automatic seam extraction has become a research hotspot. The welding objects in this paper are a type of multi-variety gate-shaped workpieces, the shapes of workpieces and the distribution of seams are uncertain, the current seam extraction methods are difficult to deal with. For this challenge, this paper aims to propose an automatic seam extraction method based on the improved DLP vision system. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, an improved DLP (Digital Light Processing) structured light vision system is first set up, which integrates 2D seam region detection results into the 3D point cloud reconstruction process. By this solution, several independent point clouds of different seam regions can be generated, and the type of seam on each point cloud can also be obtained. Subsequently, for different types of welding seams, the corresponding seam extraction algorithms are designed by analyzing the local structural characteristics. Findings The experimental results demonstrate the proposed improved DLP structured light vision system can automatically, accurately and efficiently complete the seam extraction for the workpieces with multiple seams of different types in the field of view. Originality/value The proposed method enhances robotic welding automation for workpieces with multiple seams of different types, overcoming the limitations of the current methods.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to examine the concept of circular economy through the lens of circular fashion. The model suggests important behavioral and demographic variables that determine the attitude toward circular products and their influence on circular purchase intentions (CPIs). Design/methodology/approach Structural equation modeling was used to test the model using data from 825 Hindu consumers, while multi-group analysis was used to test the moderating roles of gender and the type of clothing. Findings The findings have shown that religiosity and perceived risk influence attitudes, which mediates their impact on purchase intention. Moreover, these relationships are moderated by gender and type of clothing, where the females emerge as cautious consumer of circular fashion and secondhand clothing as compared to recycled clothing is associated with greater cultural reservations linked with the beliefs of karmic residue. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to create a framework enhancing CPI within Indian context. It delves into the segmentation of different types of clothing emphasizing the importance of perceived risk and religiosity as a key determinant in adoption of circular fashion. This study lays the foundation for advancing future academic research and fostering innovative marketing practices aimed at promoting circular fashion.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This article aims to examine how online disinformation fuelled the 2024 UK riots through an online-offline feedback loop. In this cycle, digital falsehoods sparked offline violence and were re-circulated as evidence and validations for the actions. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a qualitative secondary analysis of 40 English-language sources, including journalistic, institutional and investigative material. Through inductive coding and triangulation, it identifies the key actors and actions driving the online-offline feedback loop during the riots. Findings False online posts about the Southport attacker’s identity spread rapidly across platforms, amplified by influencers, social media and foreign actors. These claims fuelled offline violence and reappeared online as “proof.” The study reveals how far-right networks, actors and digital evidence expose the cyclical flow of disinformation online and offline. Research limitations/implications The study relies on secondary data and excludes primary social media content for ethical reasons. The findings call for a larger mixed-methods study to map disinformation pathways, examine racial dynamics and design early intervention strategies. Practical implications The article calls for a better legislative framework, stronger social media safety measures and increased digital resilience, supported by coordinated regulatory, technical, educational and community interventions across digital and social spheres. Social implications The study highlights how online information disorder deepens social division and erodes trust, demonstrating the need to rebuild community resilience and strengthen media literacy to counter polarisation. Originality/value This article’s originality lies in applying consumer behavioural theory to explain how social media dynamics shape user behaviour and translate digital disinformation into real-world mobilisation and harm through a continuous cycle of interaction.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to investigate whether the effect of government consumption expenditure on economic growth is nonlinear and influenced by institutional and structural characteristics. Unlike most existing literature, which uses linear models, this study reexamines the relationship to determine if growth outcomes differ based on expenditure size, development level and institutional context. Design/methodology/approach The study analyzes data from 86 countries between 1980 and 2019, using linear, threshold and semiparametric panel data models to capture potential nonlinearities. Robustness checks include quadratic models, interactions with global crises, controls for financial development and different time aggregations. Findings The linear model indicates a statistically significant negative association between government consumption and economic growth. Threshold estimates identify a significant breakpoint at 10.26% of GDP, with positive growth effects below the threshold and negative, although statistically insignificant, effects above it. Semiparametric results show that the marginal effect of government consumption declines smoothly as its size increases and becomes negligible beyond a certain point, with substantial cross-country heterogeneity. Further analysis reveals that growth effects vary systematically with institutional quality, corruption and the sectoral composition of expenditure. Developed economies tend to experience negative returns to government consumption, while developing countries exhibit more moderate effects, often close to zero or weakly positive. Originality/value This study offers a flexible, multi-method assessment of the nonlinear relationship between government consumption and growth. By combining threshold and semiparametric methods and accounting for institutional differences, the study findings highlight the need to adapt fiscal policy to each country’s institutional capacity, development level and expenditure structure.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This review critically examines the use of machine learning (ML) for calibrating low-cost air quality sensors (LCSs), which, despite their growing deployment for high-resolution monitoring, suffer from significant accuracy limitations. This paper aims to synthesize recent advances, evaluate methodological strengths and weaknesses and clarify ongoing debates regarding the reliability, transparency and generalizability of ML-based calibration strategies. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on more than 90 peer-reviewed studies published between 2013 and early 2024, identified through structured searches in Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore and Google Scholar using combinations of keywords such as “low-cost air quality sensor,” “machine learning calibration,” “drift correction” and “transferability,” this review surveys calibration approaches applied to major sensor types (optical, electrochemical, metal-oxide semiconductor and nondispersive infrared) across pollutants such as particulate matter, ozone and nitrogen dioxide. Both traditional regressions and advanced ML models are analyzed. The review highlights methodological practices, performance benchmarks and controversies regarding overfitting, model transferability and the role of ancillary variables. Findings Evidence demonstrates that ML calibration can reduce error metrics by more than 50% and raise correlation with reference monitors to R2 values exceeding 0.8–0.9. For optical particulate matter sensors, cross-study evaluations commonly report postcalibration R2 in the 0.8–0.95 range with slopes close to unity under long-term colocation, whereas calibrated electrochemical gas sensors for NO2 and O3 more typically achieve R2 between about 0.6 and 0.9, with larger site-to-site variability. Case studies from diverse environments illustrate how neural networks and gradient boosting often outperform simpler models when sufficient training data are available, while regression approaches remain robust and comparatively stable under limited-data conditions. However, challenges such as sensor drift, lack of standardized protocols and limited generalizability across sites persist. Transparency concerns, particularly with black-box models, further complicate adoption in regulatory settings. Originality/value By synthesizing results across pollutants, algorithms and deployment contexts, this review offers a balanced appraisal of ML’s potential and limitations for LCS calibration. It identifies best practices, emphasizes the importance of training data and validation strategies, and underscores emerging hybrid methods that integrate sensor physics with data-driven models. The analysis provides guidance for researchers, practitioners and policymakers seeking to enhance the reliability and scalability of low-cost sensor networks for air quality management.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to explore tourists’ intentions to use artificial intelligence chatbots in tourism by integrating the Stimulus–Organism–Response (S-O-R) framework with affordance theory and the theory of consumption values. It conceptualizes chatbot affordances as stimuli that influence perceived functional, social and emotional values, which, in turn, affect usage intention. Design/methodology/approach A mixed-method approach was used, integrating partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Data were collected from 401 Taiwanese tourists via a structured online survey. Findings PLS-SEM results show that visibility, interactivity, information association and privacy/security affordances significantly enhance perceived values, which all positively influence usage intention. Notably, interactivity does not affect social value. fsQCA reveals multiple causal pathways to high or low usage intentions, with information association consistently emerging as a core condition in high-intention configurations. These findings have strategic implications for user segmentation in chatbot design: immediacy and interactivity attract younger users, while privacy and security appeal to risk-averse ones, guiding tailored affordances. Originality/value This study offers theoretical and methodological innovation by extending the S-O-R model with affordance and value theories and using both symmetrical (PLS-SEM) and configurational (fsQCA) analyses. The findings contribute to smart tourism literature and provide practical insights for chatbot design and strategic deployment in the tourism sector.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Studies have shown that organisms may adjust metabolic rates in response to thermal variability, highlighting metabolic plasticity as a key adaptive mechanism. Understanding the extent of metabolic plasticity of an organism is key to predicting its adaptation to climate change. In birds, the embryos from the uniparentally incubating species are more frequently exposed to intermittent cooling due to the parents' repeated absences from the nest than the embryos from the species with biparental incubation. Such pressure may favour them to evolve a better ability to cope with the physiologically suppressive effects of low temperatures and temperature fluctuations. We compared embryonic heart rate, a proxy for embryonic metabolic rate, and its response to egg temperature change between two closely related species, the biparentally incubating Black‐throated Tit ( Aegithalos concinnus ) and the uniparentally incubating Silver‐throated Tit ( Aegithalos glaucogularis ). We also conducted an interspecific egg‐swapping experiment to investigate the effect of incubation environment on embryonic metabolism and its consequences (i.e. incubation period length and hatching success). Consistent with the expectation, Silver‐throated Tit exhibited a trend (although nonsignificant) of higher embryonic heart rate than Black‐throated Tit. Also, when egg temperatures dropped, Silver‐throated Tit showed a significantly slower decrease in embryonic heart rate than Black‐throated Tit, suggesting that they may better cope with temperature drop. In the egg‐swapping experiment, embryonic heart rates did not differ significantly between fostered and not‐fostered eggs, but following fostering, heart rates tended to decrease in Silver‐throated Tit embryos and increase in Black‐throated Tit embryos, suggesting that embryos of both species show some responsiveness to new thermal environments. Egg‐fostering treatment did not affect hatching success in either species, but the fostered eggs of Silver‐throated Tits and Black‐throated Tits tended to shorten and lengthen their incubation period, respectively, implying that the relatively stable biparental incubation environment may facilitate faster embryonic development than the more variable uniparental incubation environment. The findings enhance our understanding of the developmental strategies and responsiveness to changed environments in avian embryos under different parental care modes and provide insights into their potential to respond to climate change.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Environmental stochasticity poses significant challenges to population persistence. A key mechanism thought to buffer populations against such variability is demographic buffering—the ability of a population to stabilise growth despite temporal fluctuations in survival, development or reproduction. However, empirical tests of demographic buffering remain limited and often yield conflicting results. Here, we propose an integrative demographic framework that combines two complementary approaches to identify demographic buffering: (1) stochastic elasticities, which quantify the sensitivity of long‐term stochastic growth rates ( λ s ) to variance in demographic processes, and (2) second‐order derivatives of deterministic growth ( λ ₁), which indicate whether selection acts to reduce or amplify variance in vital rates. Applying this framework to 43 natural populations across 37 mammalian species, we position each species along a variance continuum and assess whether those with low stochastic elasticities—suggestive of buffering—also exhibit signs of concave selection on key demographic processes. While most primates and a few other long‐lived mammals occupy the buffered end of the continuum, only one species—the Columbian ground squirrel—exhibits strong support for our hypothesis, with key vital rates both critical for λ ₁ and under concave selection. In contrast, primates, despite showing low stochastic elasticities, often show convex or absent second‐order effects on their most influential vital rates, indicating a mismatch between ecological buffering and evolutionary constraint. Our findings suggest that demographic buffering is more dynamic and context dependent than previously recognised. Selection does not consistently act to reduce variance in key demographic processes, even in species where population growth appears robust to environmental variability. This decoupling implies that evolutionary and ecological signals of buffering may not always align. Our framework offers a new lens to dissect the demographic and selective processes underpinning resilience, providing a scalable tool for exploring demographic strategies across taxa. Future work integrating phylogenetic context, trait covariation and environmental drivers will be essential to understand the adaptive value of demographic buffering under global change.",

    "Abstract": "In the central highlands of Odisha, India, Kutia Kondh families navigate a precarious reality shaped by productive autonomy, decentralized authority, and material and relational uncertainty. Abundance and destitution are finely balanced in a world where humans, animals, ancestors, and spirits are co‐present and co‐dependent but also opaque and unpredictable. A significant amount of ‘tact’ is therefore required to create enduring links of mutuality whilst also respecting the autonomy of the parties involved. Tactful action appears at multiple scales: everyday relational negotiations, shamanic dialogues, and ritual sacrifice are attempts to bring the uncertainty and heterogeneity of life into some kind of temporary orbit. These tactful elicitations of mutuality are a way to manage the difficult dead, unsatiated spirits, and uncanny therianthropes – nightmares of unmanaged commensuration in a situation of intense more‐than‐human mutuality. While the Kutia have a long history of ‘segmentary egalitarianism’ in regional politics, the everyday management of relational precarity in Kutia villages is opposed to any sense of equality‐as‐equivalence. Kutia families ultimately grapple with different egalitarian registers in the mutualities of upland life. Alongside egalitarian boundary work in communal relations, there is the newer civic egalitarianism of the Odisha state – an egalitarian register at a much larger scale, accompanied by new nightmares of total, tactless commensuration.",

A feature of their strategy was the appropriation of human rights arguments to assert protections for the ‘unborn’. The adoption of human rights aligned with the international pro‐life movement's assertion that these agreements extended to embryos. Their position developed concurrently with feminist demands for gendered interpretations of human rights. Pro‐life advocates countered feminists by holding that fetal personhood protections secured women's rights, where women's most important role was still motherhood. Thus, pro‐life figures insisted that keeping abortion illegal protected both ‘unborn’ persons and women in a gender binary system.",

Methods A total of 122 SLPs enrolled in a graduate programme in South India voluntarily participated in a cross‐sectional online survey. The survey questionnaire gathered information on the following aspects in the context of serving the ageing population: caseload characteristics, assessment and diagnosis, management, challenges faced and future perspectives. Results The survey results revealed that approximately 50% of the participants' caseloads included older adults. However, the participants reported being moderately prepared for the assessment and management of communication and swallowing disorders in the ageing population. Further, the survey reports the perceived barriers to their preparedness and practice, including physical health issues, cognitive decline and lack of support from caregivers among significant others. Conclusions Overall, the survey findings indicate growing recognition of the increasing demand for speech‐language pathology services for older adults in India in the coming years, particularly for cognitive‐communication and swallowing disorders. The survey highlights the need for the inclusion of courses related to the communication and swallowing needs of older adults in the graduate curriculum, specialised training in the use of evidence‐based practices for addressing age‐related conditions and greater use of technology to improve service delivery.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aim This study aimed to determine whether infants' oromotor skills were related to the onset of babbling and their phonetic inventory at 6 months of age. Methods Parents of 50 6‐month‐old infants (41 full‐term, 9 preterm) completed the Child Oral and Motor Proficiency Scale (ChOMPS), a valid and reliable caregiver‐report measure of oromotor, feeding, and gross motor development. Caregivers additionally reported information about their infant's babbling and perceived phonetic inventory, or protophones, via an online questionnaire. Results Linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant positive association between ChOMPS scores at 6 months and the number of different protophones parents reported that the infant produced. Logistic regression modelling showed that infants' ChOMPS scores significantly predicted their likelihood of babbling by 6 months of age. Preterm status and sex were not associated with babbling onset or phonetic inventory. Conclusion These findings suggest a possible link between early oromotor development and emerging speech abilities in infancy. Infants with stronger oromotor skills at 6 months tended to produce a larger variety of protophones and were more likely to be early babblers, per parent report. These results reveal the potential value of early oromotor behaviours as indicators of developing speech skills.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Following discussions, interactions and reflections during the 2024 Royal Geographical Society (with IBG) conference ‘Map Room Conversations’ sessions, this paper examines archival maps in relation to diaspora through an affective lens. Using an auto‐ethnographic epistolary praxis of letter‐writing and the therapeutic prompt ‘What came up for you?’, it aims to bring out marginalised narratives and enable diasporic subjects to reclaim agency over their histories and identities. As a medium for the performativity of memory, letter‐writing enables affective engagement with maps of ‘Hindustan’ and ‘Himalaya’, facilitating access to suppressed emotions and genealogical narratives, shifting away from viewing maps as merely colonial artefacts and repositioning them as ‘mediators’ of diasporic affect and agency, thus animating them as sites of remembering, reconnecting and healing.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aripiprazole, a third‐generation antidepressant/antipsychotic drug, acts on serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors and is widely prescribed for mental disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia. Studies indicate that this class of drugs can impact directly on sperm quality and fertility. Then, this study evaluated the effects of subchronic exposure to aripiprazole on sperm quality and fertility of adult male Wistar rats. Thirty‐six rats were divided into three groups: control, 3 mg/kg and 6 mg/kg of aripiprazole orally exposed for 28 days. Our results showed that aripiprazole significantly increased seminal vesicle weight at a dose of 6 mg/kg. Progressive sperm motility was reduced, and there was an increase in the diameter of the seminiferous tubules at a dose of 3 mg/kg. Fertility test was reduced at a dose of 6 mg/kg. These findings suggest that although aripiprazole is effective in treating mental disorders, it may have subtle adverse effects on reproduction, especially on sperm quality and fertility, raising concerns about its indiscriminate use at doses higher than those tested.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Behaviours that challenge are highly prevalent in children and adolescents with intellectual disability, impacting both their well‐being and that of their families. Understanding the role of parenting attitudes and socio‐demographic factors in these behaviours is crucial for effective support. Methods A quantitative, cross‐sectional, non‐experimental study was conducted with 193 mothers of children and adolescents aged 7 to 17 years with intellectual disability in Chile. Validated instruments were used to assess parenting attitudes, behaviours that challenge, adaptive functioning, and socio‐demographic variables. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed. Findings Parenting attitudes—particularly related to discipline and communication—were associated with higher levels of behaviours that challenge. Greater perceived fairness in parenting roles was linked to fewer internalising behaviours. Boys exhibited more internalising behaviours than girls, while externalising behaviours decreased with age. Additionally, higher levels of support needs in children predicted increased behaviours that challenge. Conclusion The findings underscore the importance of parenting attitudes in understanding behaviours that challenge in children with intellectual disability. Interventions should consider these attitudes and aim to strengthen family support systems.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background In China, therapeutic options are limited by the narrow availability of allergen preparations, with house dust mite (HDM) allergen immunotherapy (AIT) as the main choice for most patients. However, polysensitization is highly prevalent, and the benefit of HDM AIT in such patients remains uncertain. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of single‐allergen HDM AIT on both perennial and coexisting allergen‐specific symptoms in polysensitised allergic rhinitis (AR) patients and to explore predictors of treatment response. Methods We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study including 81 patients with AR who were polysensitised to HDM and at least one other inhalant allergen (e.g., pollens, mould or animal dander). All participants received HDM subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for 12 to 36 months. Baseline characteristics, including serum allergen‐specific IgE (sIgE) levels and comorbidities, were collected. Symptom severity was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and treatment response was defined as a ≥ 30% reduction in VAS scores from baseline. Statistical comparisons between responders and non‐responders were conducted using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Mann–Whitney U tests for continuous data. Firth logistic regression was used to identify predictors of treatment response. Results The overall response rate for perennial symptoms was 68.8%, and varied in patients with co‐existing allergies: 72.7% for moulds, 70.0% for animal dander, 65.5% for tree pollen, 70.2% for weed pollens. Allergen‐specific symptom response rates varied across allergens: 68.2% for moulds, 30.0% for animal dander, 56.7% for tree pollens, 74.5% for weed pollens. Higher sIgE levels to HDM and mould were significantly associated with lower response rates in patients co‐sensitised to both. A predictive model incorporating both sIgEs showed good specificity. Conclusion Single‐allergen HDM AIT is effective in many polysensitised AR patients; however, its efficacy varies by coexisting allergen type and sIgE level. Patients co‐sensitised to mould with high HDM and mould sIgE appeared to have poorer outcomes. These preliminary findings require confirmation in larger prospective studies to guide tailored AIT strategies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Safeguarding Family Group Conferencing (FGC) is a family‐led decision‐making process offered to some families in England as an alternative to an Initial Child Protection Conference when Children's Services have safeguarding concerns. A realist evaluation was conducted within three local authorities piloting this approach to build understanding around how Safeguarding FGC works in relation to desired outcomes. Qualitative data including semi‐structured interviews ( n = 27) with families and professionals, meeting observations and researchers' reflective notes were generated and used to develop, test and refine a programme theory about how the intervention works. In this paper, we highlight two key generative causal mechanisms, which help explain how Safeguarding FGC works—information sharing between families and professionals and the capacity of the family's network. The programme theory could help policy‐makers and practitioners interested in adopting family‐led approaches to child protection social work like Safeguarding FGC in England and further afield by articulating clearly the ways in which the intervention could lead to important outcomes for families.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In recent years, interest in ensuring child participation (CP) in family law cases has grown. However, there is limited knowledge about how children experience CP and how various child and family characteristics influence this experience and the outcomes of the family law case. By including survey and administrative register data, this study explores how 1079 children (ages 6–17, M = 10.8, 54% girls) experience CP via child interviews in post‐divorce mediation in family law cases processed by the Danish Agency of Family Law and how differences in these experiences are associated with whether the case is settled out of court. Using linear probability models, the results show that the majority of children found the interview to be important and felt they had procedural control over their statements. Especially older age and self‐rated pre‐interview engagement significantly predicted these outcomes. Family factors, such as maternal educational background or familial risk factors, had a lesser impact on the children's experience of CP but mattered for the parents' mediation process. Children who found the interview to be important were also more likely to have their parental case concluded with an out‐of‐court agreement. Finally, potential reasons and concerns for the variations in children's participation experiences is discussed.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Bone‐related diseases (e.g., osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and fractures) exhibit a rising global incidence, imposing significant burdens on both quality of life and healthcare systems. Conventional therapeutic approaches, including anti‐resorptive drugs and surgical interventions, face limitations such as long‐term medication requirements, adverse effects (e.g., bisphosphonate‐related osteonecrosis of the jaw) and suboptimal efficacy. Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs) have emerged as a promising therapeutic alternative due to their accessibility, multi‐lineage differentiation potential, immunomodulatory properties and homing capacity. However, challenges such as disease complexity, mechanistic heterogeneity and therapeutic inconsistency hinder their clinical translation. Recent advances in genetic engineering, preconditioning strategies, bone tissue engineering (e.g., three‐dimensional [3D] scaffolding), extracellular vesicle‐based therapies and epigenetic regulation (e.g., histone modification) have significantly enhanced the therapeutic effects of BMSCs. Furthermore, cutting‐edge technologies like organoids and 3D bioprinting, which stem from advances in tissue engineering, offer novel avenues for clinical applications. Given these rapid developments, this review systematically summarises BMSC‐based treatment strategies for bone‐related diseases, discusses current challenges and outlines future directions to advance translational research.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Protected areas represent cornerstones of biodiversity conservation on oceanic islands, yet their effectiveness for endemic species remains poorly evaluated. We assessed how various territorial protection categories conserve an endemic oceanic bird by comparing periods of population maxima and minima in Fuerteventura. Using 500‐m transects across the island, we analyzed local abundance differences inside versus outside protected areas, identified proportions of populations within protection boundaries, and examined cohabitation patterns with other avian species. Local stonechat abundance was significantly higher only inside Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) (non‐targeted to birds), with no advantage in Special Protection Areas for Birds (SPAs), despite their avian conservation purpose (i.e., targeted to birds). Temporal analyses revealed a sharper decline in stonechat abundance inside SACs compared to unprotected areas, and similar changes outside and inside SPAs. Approximately 42% of the stonechat population and 72% of its occupancy area remained outside SPA boundaries during both periods, demonstrating inefficient spatial alignment with the species' distribution. Unprotected areas gained critical significance during the 2024 population minimum, as static boundaries failed to capture the species' shifting distribution patterns. The stonechat showed positive associations with five other endemic subspecies but no spatial overlap with emblematic “flagship” species that typically drive conservation decisions. Conservation planning must adopt more dynamic approaches that not only account for species' spatial distributions under optimal conditions but also identify and protect key refugia during population declines. This is particularly critical for improving the effectiveness of protected areas for island endemics with restricted and environmentally sensitive habitat requirements.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Myoepithelioma‐like tumor of the vulva region (MELTVR) is a low‐grade mesenchymal neoplasm and mainly arises in the subcutaneous tissue of the vulva and surrounding regions in adult females. Here, a case of MELTVR is reported and the literature is systematically reviewed to shed light on this rare disease. The patient was a 46‐year‐old female who presented with a lump in the right vulva region after local trauma. On microscopic examination, the tumor cells displayed epithelioid or spindled morphology with fine amphophilic cytoplasm and uniform nuclei with vesicular chromatin. Immunohistochemical staining showed that tumor cells were positive for vimentin and calponin but negative for S100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, AE1/AE3, and CD34. INI1/SMARCB1 expression was absent in the tumor nuclei. Fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed no EWSR1 or FUS gene rearrangements. These findings confirm the diagnosis of MELTVR. Although the biological behaviors of MELTVR remain incompletely understood, recognition of its characteristic morphologic and immunophenotypic profiles will aid in distinguishing it from potential histological mimics better.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective Screening high‐risk populations for lung cancer with low‐dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduced lung cancer mortality. Endobronchial ultrasound‐guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS‐TBNA) is a well‐established technique for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) during bronchoscopy. Moreover, rapid on‐site evaluation (ROSE) improves the diagnostic yield and accuracy of EBUS‐TBNA. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether ROSE is an efficacious diagnostic tool for PPLs. Therefore, this meta‐analysis aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ROSE for PPLs during EBUS bronchoscopy. Methods A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases was conducted to identify studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of ROSE for PPLs during EBUS bronchoscopy. Our study included articles that evaluated the performance of ROSE against a reference standard. Additionally, we examined journal articles that provided sufficient data to construct a 2 × 2 table on a per‐lesion basis. To estimate the overall sensitivity and specificity, a meta‐analysis was conducted using a bivariate random‐effects model. Results Thirteen studies with 1841 PPLs were included. The meta‐analysis yielded a pooled sensitivity of 88.1% and a pooled specificity of 91.7%. A subgroup analysis for studies that enrolled patients who underwent CT produced a pooled sensitivity of 94.2% and a pooled specificity of 96.9%. Furthermore, accuracy of ROSE sampled by EBUS using a guide sheath showed a pooled sensitivity of 88.5%. Conclusion The ROSE technique demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for lung cancer detection during EBUS bronchoscopy for PPLs. Furthermore, ROSE might have higher sensitivity among patients who underwent CT.",

This study evaluated post‐dexamethasone cortisol levels across distinct BMI categories and their associations with metabolic parameters. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 352 adults with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 ) who underwent 1 mg overnight DST between February 2019 and August 2023. Patients were stratified into three groups: BMI 30.0–39.9 kg/m 2 ( n = 64), BMI 40.0–49.9 kg/m 2 ( n = 202), and BMI ≥50.0 kg/m 2 ( n = 86). Clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory parameters were compared between groups. Results The cohort had a median age of 41 years and comprised 284 females (80.7%). Post‐dexamethasone cortisol levels showed modest differences across BMI categories (median 0.79, 0.77, and 0.88 μg/dL, respectively; p = 0.038). Inadequate cortisol suppression after the 1 mg dexamethasone test was rare, occurring in four patients (1.1%) overall: 0/64 (0%) in BMI 30.0–39.9 kg/m 2 , 2/202 (1.0%) in BMI 40.0–49.9 kg/m 2 , and 2/86 (2.3%) in BMI ≥50.0 kg/m 2 ; continuous BMI was not associated with post‐dexamethasone cortisol levels. Patients with super obesity demonstrated higher rates of hypertension (36% vs. 18.7–22.2%, p = 0.021) and diabetes (30.2% vs. 16.8–18.7%, p = 0.033). Conclusions These findings emphasize that elevated post‐dexamethasone cortisol levels in patients with obesity should not be attributed to body weight alone but warrant appropriate evaluation for true hypercortisolism, with clinical interpretation guided by metabolic phenotype rather than BMI.",

Previously assessed as depleted, the narrow‐barred Spanish mackerel fishery on the east coast of Queensland, Australia, is under management intervention to rebuild the stock. In this study, we use long‐term age composition data to reconstruct 24 years of historic year class strength and explore a broad range of potential environmental influences on recruitment variability in the fishery. Year class strength was extremely well captured (76%–84% deviance explained) by generalised additive models containing just four environmental indices. Recurring key environmental indices in top models included environmental conditions prior to spawning (large scouring flood events during the wet season before spawning and cool winter sea surface temperature immediately prior to spawning), during spawning (unseasonal flooding near the spawning grounds), during larval dispersal and proxies for food availability for juvenile Spanish mackerel. These results have since been used to hindcast recruitment variability in the fishery prior to the collection of the age‐composition data to better understand historic fluctuations in the fishery, and can also be incorporated into management strategies for rebuilding the stock.",

This paper empirically examines the relationships between urban concentration and economic growth. Using fixed effects (FE) estimations with OECD country panel data, we find that increased urban concentration within non‐primary cities can promote national economic growth, potentially by mitigating excessive urban primacy—the disproportionate concentration of economic activity in the largest city. These findings suggest that in countries with high urban primacy, policies focused on fostering the development of relatively large second‐tier cities can effectively address excessive urban primacy and support more balanced growth.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Place‐based pedagogy (PBP) has recently gained international prominence as an approach that connects learning with local contexts and communities. In China, it is increasingly invoked as a way to revitalize rural education, yet little is known about how rural English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers interpret and enact it in practice. This study explores how ten rural EFL teachers make sense of PBP as a newly introduced teaching method. Drawing on Kumaravadivelu's macro‐strategic framework of particularity, practicality, and possibility, the analysis reveals a dynamic process in which teachers negotiate between national policy discourses, test‐oriented school cultures, and local sociocultural realities. Rather than replicating Western models, they decontextualized PBP to link English learning with rural identity, moral education, and community development. The study highlights teacher agency as a mediating force between global pedagogical ideas and local educational needs, demonstrating how language teaching can become a site for negotiating social change and educational equity in rural China.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Sirex woodwasp ( Sirex noctilio ; Hymenoptera: Siricidae) is among the most destructive invasive pests affecting Pinus plantations worldwide. Chemosensory systems offer promising targets for pest control strategies. The identification and characterization of chemosensation genes in non‐model, economically significant insects such as S. noctilio , is an important first step towards the development of such control methods. Here we sequenced and assembled a draft genome of S. noctilio and performed RNA‐sequencing of 15 olfactory and non‐olfactory tissues to study the expression patterns of chemosensation‐related genes. Specific genes, such as SnocOR16 and SnocSNMP1 , displayed tissue‐ and sex‐specific expression patterns, making them particularly intriguing for their potential roles in chemosensation and oviposition. As woodwasps and their related lineages form a sister group to the majority of other Hymenoptera, including Apocrita, insights into their gene repertoires are crucial for tracing the evolutionary history of chemosensory multigene families of this ecologically and economically significant insect order. This study enhances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying S. noctilio chemosensation, paving the way for further research in chemical ecology and the functional characterization of S. noctilio chemosensation genes.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Many countries of the Global North depend on the economic benefits of migration even as their citizens and leaders evince ever more open opposition to immigrants settling and becoming citizens. One result of this misalignment of interests and goals has been the proliferation of visa statuses that commit their bearers to not seeking permanent settlement or citizenship and offer them very few rights. Many scholars have debated whether and in which ways short‐term migration may be normatively problematic, and in particular, exploitative. In this paper we add to existing critiques of temporary migration regimes as unjust and materially exploitative the claim that such schemes exploit not just the labor and other material contributions of short‐term immigrants, but also the social capital they build by necessity when they are in residence.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Efforts to intervene in complex systems often emphasize influential factors, yet system behavior is equally shaped by the relationships among them. Methods such as Decision‐Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) map causal structures but remain descriptive and do not identify which relationships provide the greatest leverage for change. This study develops a spectral sensitivity framework that extends DEMATEL from mapping to prescriptive analysis. We link system amplification to the maximum eigenvalue of the total relation matrix and derive its sensitivity to each relationship, classifying modifications as amplifying responsiveness or enhancing stability. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a mathematical framework for relationship‐level leverage point identification with closed‐form sensitivity results; (ii) a demonstration that its assumptions hold in practice; and (iii) an open web application that automates the analysis and delivers actionable outputs. A case study on challenges in adopting energy management systems demonstrates how the method identifies critical intervention pathways for system change.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Non‐lethal biopsy is a valuable tool for gaining insight into the physiological status of fish in the wild and for predicting their subsequent behaviour and survival. However, linking the insights from biopsy to post‐release behaviour relies on the assumption that the biopsy itself has no meaningful impact on post‐release behaviour or survival (e.g. in animals tagged with electronic devices). This assumption is likely to be questioned by fishery managers, animal ethics committees, and other researchers. To date, there has been very little work to assess the sublethal (or lethal) effects of biopsies on fish, and no such studies have evaluated fine‐scale behaviours. Here, muscle and gill tissue samples were taken (both individually and as a combined treatment) from hatchery‐reared juvenile lake trout ( Salvelinus namaycush ) in captivity. Twenty‐four hours after sampling, we used two behavioural assays (behaviour within a Z maze and flight initiation distance) and quantified exhaustive exercise performance to determine whether biopsies impacted behaviour or physiology when compared to non‐sampled controls. We found no evidence that biopsies had any influence on exploratory and shelter‐seeking behaviour in the maze, flight initiation distance, or time to exhaustion (as a proxy for swimming performance). Mortality during a 7‐day monitoring period was very low (2% across treatments) and limited to fish that received either a gill biopsy or the combined biopsy treatment. This study provides empirical support for the use of non‐lethal biopsy in juvenile salmonids as a means of collecting physiological data on individuals in behavioural studies and experiments.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Conventional embryological models propose that the urorectal septum (URS) fuses with the cloacal membrane (CM) to form separate exits for the hindgut and urogenital sinus (UGS). However, previous studies have been re‐evaluating this assumption, and the precise morphogenetic mechanisms determining the position of the anal opening remain unclear. To elucidate the spatial and temporal dynamics of cloacal development, we analysed mouse embryos from embryonic day (E)11.5 to E13.5 using serial midsagittal histological sections combined with three‐dimensional reconstruction. We focused on the positional relationship between the URS and CM, as well as the internal remodelling events of the cloaca that lead to anal opening formation. Throughout development, the URS enlarged and shifted distally, but consistently remained dorsodistal to the CM without direct fusion. At E13.0, we identified an expanded space at the caudal end of the hindgut, distinct from the hindgut lumen. By E13.25, this space connected to the UGS via a duct‐like structure, contributing to the separation of the UGS and hindgut. By E13.5, the CM ruptured and the anal opening emerged precisely at the junction between the hindgut lumen and the expanded space. Our findings demonstrate that the position of the anal opening is predetermined by cloacal internal space remodelling rather than fusion of the URS and CM. This study offers novel insights into normal anorectal development and the aetiology of congenital anorectal malformations.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Oral lichen planus (OLP) is a chronic T‐cell‐mediated immune disease of unknown aetiology. MicroRNA (miRNAs) are short non‐coding RNAs capable of regulating mRNA and may have roles in T‐cell‐related diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the profile of miRNAs in OLP patients and its interaction with potential target genes. Methods Total RNA was extracted from fresh frozen biopsies from 24 patients with OLP and 8 control patients. The NanoString Counter Analysis System was used to analyse total RNA samples for differential miRNA expression. NanoString expression was confirmed by RT‐qPCR analysis. Genes potentially targeted by upregulated and downregulated miRNAs were identified, and RT‐qPCR was employed to investigate the expression of target genes in OLP and controls. Probability values &lt; 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results NanoString analysis showed that eight miRNAs, miR‐155, miR‐146a, miR‐3195, miR‐342, miR‐4516, miR‐21, miR‐29a and miR‐193 were upregulated in OLP tissues. Contrarily, the other eight miRNAs, miR‐221, miR‐200b, miR‐149, miR‐205, miR‐27b, miR‐95, miR‐127b, miR‐95, miR‐206 were downregulated in OLP tissues. NanoString findings have been confirmed by RT‐qPCR results for four upregulated miRNAs, miR‐155, miR‐146a, miR‐29a and miR‐342, and one downregulated miRNA, namely miR‐205. The expression of two target genes, namely MYC for miR‐29a and interleukin‐24 (IL‐24) for miR‐205, was found to negatively correlate with the respective miRNA. This suggests that MYC and IL‐24 could be regulated by the above miRNAs in OLP. Conclusions The work presented in this study suggests that miRNAs could be involved in both the immunopathogenesis and malignant transformation of OLP.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective Posteriorly tilted femoral neck fractures have been extensively studied, whereas anteriorly tilted fractures remain largely unreported. This study aims to characterize the clinical features, radiographic patterns, and postoperative outcomes of femoral neck fractures with anterior tilt. Methods This retrospective cohort study included adult patients with OTA/AO type 31B femoral neck fractures who underwent internal fixation within 36 h at a single orthopedic center from 2018 to 2022 and had ≥ 24 months of follow‐up. Tilt angle was assessed using preoperative radiographs and CT. Associations between fracture characteristics and postoperative outcomes were examined using univariate and multivariable logistic regression, with covariates selected according to clinical relevance and univariate significance. Results Among 212 patients (median age: 55 years, 53.3% male), anterior tilt fractures were more common in females (57.6%) and those with valgus malalignment (69.7%). Anteriorly tilted femoral neck fractures required a distinct reduction technique compared to conventional femoral neck fractures. Displaced fractures were significantly associated with a higher risk of femoral head necrosis (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.16; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29–13.42; p = 0.017). Stratified analysis revealed that anteriorly tilted femoral neck fractures with varus malalignment—herein referred to as the “anterior‐flexion/adduction” subtype—were significantly associated with increased risk of femoral head necrosis (aOR = 7.19; 95% CI 1.12–46.18; p = 0.038). Conclusions Anterior tilt alone is not a general prognostic risk factor; however, fractures characterized by anterior tilt combined with varus alignment represent a high‐risk subtype requiring careful preoperative recognition and treatment planning. Further prospective studies are needed to validate these findings.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Management of structural heart diseases (SHD) with either transcatheter or surgical valve interventions has led to a growing number of patients requiring post‐procedural permanent pacemaker implantation,(PPI) with rates of implantation reaching as high as 37.7% after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Transvenous pacemakers (TVP) have been the standard of care for such cases, although they carry the risk of numerous complications, such as surgical pocket and lead infections. Leadless pacemakers (LP) were introduced as an alternative to minimize these risks. This study aims to compare the outcomes of leadless versus TVP implantation in patients undergoing valve intervention during the peri‐procedural duration. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta‐analysis of studies identified through a comprehensive search of the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases, performed in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook, to compare leadless and TVP in valve intervention patients during the peri‐procedural period. Data analysis was performed using Comprehensive Meta‐analysis (CMA, version 3.7.107). Primary outcomes included mortality, rehospitalization, and device‐ or procedure‐related complications. Risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs) were calculated for dichotomous and continuous outcomes, respectively, both with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The protocol was prospectively registered (PROSPERO: CRD420251150891). Results The meta‐analysis included 5 cohort studies comprising 10,494 participants. 794 patients received LP and 9,700 received conventional TVP. LP patients had a significantly higher mortality risk (RR = 1.85; 95% CI, 1.06–3.20; p = 0.029), longer hospital stay (MD = 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43–0.90; p &lt; 0.001) and lower ventricular pacing burden (MD = ‐11.39; 95% CI, ‐18.98 to ‐3.80; p = 0.003) compared to patients with conventional TVP. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding rehospitalization, pocket infection, lead/device dislodgement, and vascular complications. Conclusion In this meta‐analysis, LP implantation was associated with reduced ventricular pacing burden, but at the expense of a longer hospital stay and increased mortality risk compared with conventional TVP. No significant differences were observed between the two modalities in terms of rehospitalization, pocket infection, lead/device dislodgement, and vascular complications. These findings suggest that although LP were associated with higher observed mortality, this association is likely driven by selection bias, as leadless devices are preferentially implanted in patients with higher baseline risk and greater comorbidity burden. Randomized controlled trials are needed to clarify the comparative safety of leadless versus TVP while minimizing confounding by indication.",

However, females have been underrepresented in PROTECT &amp; PREVAIL landmark trials supporting LAAO use. We aim to compare gender differences in outcomes of LAAO occlusive devices. Methods The national readmission database (2016–2020) was utilized to identify hospitalizations for LAAO placement. Cohorts were stratified by gender as males and females. A propensity score matching (PSM) model matched both cohorts. Pearson's x2 test was applied to the matched cohorts to compare outcomes. Results Among 89,552 hospitalizations for LAAO placement, 41.3% of procedures were performed in females. Females were found to have a lower prevalence of co‐morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and CKD [ p &lt; 0.001]. After propensity matching ( N = 20,627), females had higher adverse events, including mortality (0.23% vs. 0.15%, p : 0.041), sudden cardiac arrest (1.77% vs. 1.37%, p : 0.001), pericardial complications (1.46% vs. 0.86%, p &lt; 0.001), cardiac tamponade (0.94% vs. 0.54%, p &lt; 0.001), post‐procedural bleeding (0.69% vs. 0.53%, p : 0.032) &amp; net adverse events (4.73% vs. 4.24%, p &lt; 0.001).

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This study reexamines the position and policies of the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan) towards the Ryukyus in the period from the 1943 Cairo Conference to the 1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement. In order to do so, this research focuses on international politics and domestic society to look for determinants of shifts in the ROC position. The results show that the ROC position towards the Ryukyus was shifted between passive and assertive positions, mainly depending on external factors. The study identifies four decisive factors defining ROC positions and policy: (1) the international status of the ROC government; (2) the ROC policy of military recovery of mainland China; (3) the focus in the international sphere on the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu/Diaoyutai) sovereignty dispute; and (4) Taiwan's domestic popular opinion. Finally, the paper identifies factors that help explain the shift in the ROC position towards the sovereignty of the Ryukyus. This paper has shown that ROC policy tended to be more assertive when the international status of the ROC was stable, when the policy of military recovery of the mainland was in question, when the international focus on the Senkakus (Diaoyu/Diaoyutai) sovereignty dispute was low, and when ROC domestic public opinion on the issue was strong. Conversely, under conditions of instability in the ROC's international status, strong support for the recovery of the mainland policy, spikes in the Senkakus (Diaoyu/Diaoyutai) controversy in the international sphere, and domestic weak public interest in the issue, policy tended to become passive.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The main genetic diversity observed in cultivated citrus results from a reticulate evolution involving four ancestral taxa whose radiation occurred in allopatry. In such context, GWAS analysis, genome diversity and transcriptomic studies will be significantly enhanced through pangenome approaches. We report the implementation of a super‐pangenome for cultivated citrus, established with de novo assemblies of C. medica , C. reticulata and C. micrantha , released for the first time alongside a published chromosome‐scale assembly of C. maxima . Repetitive element annotation revealed that half of each genome consisted of transposable elements or DNA‐satellites. The new genome assemblies display strong synteny and collinearity, while discrepancies are observed with the C. maxima assembly. Resequencing information from 55 accessions helped to explore the intra‐ and interspecific diversity of the ancestral taxa and their relationships with horticultural groups. Diagnostic SNPs of the ancestral taxa revealed interspecific introgressions in several representative accessions of C. reticulata , C. maxima and C. medica as well as insights into the origin and phylogenomic structures of horticultural groups. PAV analysis revealed a gene whose absence or presence was specific to one of the ancestral taxa. Diagnostic PAV analysis uncovered a large chloroplastic introgression in C. medica chromosome 4. The analysis of the functional enrichment and species‐specific adaptations in the citrus super‐pangenome revealed distinct functional specialisations. This highlights the evolutionary paths that have shaped species, contributing to the diversity in the citrus super‐pangenome while maintaining a shared foundation of essential biological processes. We established a Genome Hub, offering a platform for continuous genomic research.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In the process of myocardial cell structural and functional damage caused by various factors, current therapeutic strategies primarily focus on restoring myocardial blood supply, often neglecting the inherent complex microenvironment triggered by elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels during myocardial injury. Regulating mitochondrial function and inhibiting excessive ROS production to alleviate myocardial apoptosis are therefore critical for myocardial injury repair. Plant‐derived vesicle‐like nanoparticles have shown broad applications in multiple fields and possess potential value. In this context, the present study introduces Salvia miltiorrhiza ‐derived nanoparticles (SDVLNs) to counteract ROS effects after myocardial infarction. We performed in vitro experiments to analyse the effects of SDVLNs on cardiomyocyte proliferation, migration, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function. Meanwhile, a novel concept of “natural plant‐derived vesicle‐like nanoparticles‐gel” was proposed to address the stringent storage requirements of SDVLNs. We loaded SDVLNs into a thermo‐sensitive hydrogel to prepare SDVLNs@hydrogel (SDVLNHs), and further conducted in vivo experiments to evaluate the therapeutic effects of locally administered SDVLNHs in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‐induced myocardial injury mice, with a focus on cardiac function and pathological changes in the heart. It was found that SDVLNs promoted cardiomyocyte proliferation and migration, alleviated oxidative stress, regulated mitochondrial function, and inhibited myocardial apoptosis. The developed SDVLNHs addressed the stringent storage requirements of SDVLNs, and local administration of SDVLNHs significantly improved cardiac function and reduced pathological damage in LPS‐induced myocardial injury mice. Collectively, these findings highlight the potential of SDVLNs in myocardial injury repair and their applicability as a promising solution for myocardial injury in clinical settings.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Blood transfusion remains a cornerstone in the management of sickle cell disease (SCD); however, it is frequently complicated by red cell alloimmunisation. A significant debate persists within the scientific community regarding the optimal strategy to mitigate this risk: the traditional, pragmatic approach of serologic phenotyping versus molecular genotyping, which is technically superior yet more resource‐intensive. Objectives This mini‐review aims to map the framework of this scientific debate and synthesize current evidence through a dual methodology. Methods and Materials A scientometric analysis was conducted on 224 articles indexed in Scopus and Web of Science using the Bibliometrix package for R, followed by a structured narrative review of 26 selected studies. Results The scientometric findings confirm growing interest in this topic, identifying two distinct yet interconnected research clusters that reflect the ongoing dialectic between phenotyping and genotyping, with the latter emerging as a ‘hot topic’ over the past decade. The narrative synthesis highlights a predominance of evidence supporting genotyping as the most accurate approach to preventing alloimmunisation, particularly given the high prevalence of RH system variants in individuals with SCD. In contrast, cost‐effectiveness analyses and implementation studies underscore substantial financial and logistical barriers that favour a more pragmatic, stepwise approach. Conclusion We conclude that the future of transfusion safety in SCD does not lie in a binary choice but rather in a synergistic and stratified integration of both strategies. Implementing protocols that target genotyping for high‐risk patients, while simultaneously optimising the use of extended phenotyping, represents the most promising pathway to balance safety, cost and accessibility—ultimately ensuring the best possible transfusion therapy for this vulnerable population.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background In southern Thailand, the low efficacy of albendazole contributes to the unsuccessful elimination of hookworms. Individuals infected with hookworms exhibiting low albendazole efficacy show decreased mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin and are suspected carriers of abnormal haemoglobin. This observational study aimed to compare the treatment outcomes of albendazole for hookworm infection in individuals with normal versus abnormal haemoglobin types. Methods 227 stool samples were examined using the Kato‐Katz and agar plate culture methods. Blood samples were collected from participants with hookworm‐positive stool after oral administration of 400 mg albendazole to perform complete blood counts and haemoglobin typing. Treatment outcomes were evaluated 3 weeks after albendazole administration. Participants with persistent hookworm infection received a second 400 mg dose of albendazole, and outcomes were reassessed 3 weeks later. Results Among 54 hookworm‐positive participants, 38 were cured after the first round of treatment, and 5 were cured after the second round, all of whom had normal haemoglobin. However, 11 participants remained uncured after two treatment rounds, all with abnormal haemoglobin types: 7 with heterozygous haemoglobin E, 3 with heterozygous haemoglobin constant spring (CS) and 1 with compound heterozygous haemoglobin E/CS. Conclusion These findings suggest that abnormal haemoglobin may be a host factor contributing to low albendazole efficacy in treating hookworm infections.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This work addresses the problem of setpoint tracking for tethered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems. Previous works have either used simplified models for the complex tension constraint to ensure a taut cable or proposed non-optimal strategies applicable to limited setpoints. The approach proposed here is based on the nonlinear model predictive control (nMPC), where the subtleties of implementing such a strategy for this nonlinear dynamic system with nonlinear constraints are addressed. Proposed control scheme is also complemented by a pre-stabilizing nonlinear control law to achieve a design that handles constraints and stabilizes the closed-loop system. We compare the results of the augmented pre-stabilized MPC scheme with results from the literature, as well as with the nominal nMPC case.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Lattice materials offer extraordinary opportunities for lightweight structural design, yet their practical application is often compromised by their propensity for brittle fracture originating from inherent defects. This study introduces a novel design strategy to overcome this limitation by incorporating nonlocal interactions into the lattice architecture. We investigate the fracture mechanics of two-dimensional lattice materials with and without nonlocal connections through a combination of finite element analysis and a node-based homogenization method. Our theoretical model accurately predicts the crack-tip displacement field, revealing significant deviations from classical continuum mechanics. The results strikingly demonstrate that nonlocal lattices exhibit superior stiffness, strength, and fracture toughness compared to their local counterparts. An energy-based analysis unveils the core toughening mechanism: nonlocal interactions effectively redistribute stress at the crack tip, leading to the formation of a larger plastic zone. This enhanced plasticity not only delays crack initiation by increasing the required energy for fracture but also elevates crack growth resistance by dissipating more energy during propagation. This work elucidates the fundamental role of nonlocality in enhancing fracture performance and provides a robust framework for designing tough, defect-tolerant lattice materials for high-performance applications.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract A class of parallel mechanisms with sub-moving platforms (PMs-SMPs) has significant advantages in stiffness and loading capacity over traditional PMs. A detailed classification of both the PMs-SMPs and their sub-PMs are given. One of the essential roles for PMs is to transmit motion/force between the input and output ends. An evaluation method of motion/force transmission performance (EMoMFTP) for PMs-SMPs is proposed based on the equivalent actuated joint (EAJ) strategy and modified input transmission index (MITI). Then, the definition and operation rules of the MFTP index for PMs-SMPs are established in accordance with the worst condition principle. Finally, the MFTP indices of three examples are solved, and the validity and practicability of the EMoMFTP are verified based on the singularity analysis principle of sub-kinematic chain (SKC) unit. The results show that the EMoMFTP can find all possible input singularity configurations and measure the proximity between a given pose and a singularity configuration.",

Our recent experiments with metal clusters have allowed us to demonstrate the quantum-wave nature of nanoparticles exceeding 170 kDa. Interestingly, the same experiments also allow for the preparation of moiré fringes of objects in the megadalton range. In this work, we demonstrate such moiré fringes of large sodium nanoparticles and, owing to the platform's stability, resolve nanometer-scale fringe displacements between successive contrast revivals, directly observing the predicted π-phase flip as a half-period shift. We further discuss how this feature turns the interferometer into a device for advanced sensing, even when operating in the regime where the predictions of quantum and classical physics merge.",

This paper uses the finite element software ANSYS to perform structural design of the resonant cavity of the MPCVD device and optimizes the microwave electric field distribution of the core dimensions of the conical resonant cavity (resonant cavity radius and height) so that the electric field above the deposition platform is ellipsoidal and uniformly distributed. At the same time, a diamond film deposition experiment was conducted to verify the deposition effect of the skewed-conical resonator structure. The results indicate that when the height of the conical resonant cavity is 148 mm and the bottom radius is 116 mm, the electric field strength is 3.926 × 107 V/m, with the electric field in the substrate region more concentrated and stronger at the center. Deposition experiments show that at a deposition temperature of 850 °C, the diamond grain size tends to transform toward a cubic shape, the diamond peaks are sharp, and the residual stress is low, with the film’s indentation crack diameter being 307 μm, revealing its stronger electric field focusing capability and deposition stability.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Hematology patients are highly susceptible to severe bacterial infections, particularly those caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative pathogens, which are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Eravacycline, a novel fluorocycline antibiotic, demonstrates broad-spectrum activity against MDR bacteria. This real-world study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of eravacycline in Chinese hematology patients. In this multicenter, retrospective study, hematology patients receiving ≥3 days of eravacycline between September 2023 and September 2024 were included. The outcomes included clinical response rate, microbiological response rate, and safety. Of 796 patients included, most had hematological diseases (94.6%) and recent chemotherapy or radiotherapy (80.2%). The most common infection was pneumonia (57.4%), and sputum (47.2%) was the most frequent specimen type for pathogen isolation. Among 481 patients with microbiological examination results, Klebsiella pneumoniae (30.5%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (17.4%) were predominant. The mean time to defervescence was 3.2 ± 2.1 days. The overall clinical response rate was 88.8%, with response rates of 84.0% in bloodstream infections and 87.5% in pulmonary infections. Microbiological response rate at the end of treatment was 90.7%. Eravacycline exhibited high susceptibility rates across A. baumannii (95.8%), K. pneumonia e (94.3%), and Staphylococcus aureus (100.0%). Only 2.5% of patients reported adverse events. Subgroup analysis showed that pulmonary diseases ( P = 0.006), sepsis ( P = 0.003), and duration ≤7 days ( P &lt; 0.001) of eravacycline 1 mg/kg/12 h were significantly associated with poorer clinical response rate at the end of treatment. Eravacycline demonstrated promising effectiveness and safety in treating infections of patients from the hematology department.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Colistin is considered one of the last-resort antibiotics for treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria. However, the emergence and dissemination of mobile colistin resistance gene, mcr , have severely compromised the clinical utility of colistin. Combination therapy has emerged as a promising strategy to restore and enhance antibiotic efficacy against such bacterial infections. In this study, we identified broxyquinoline (BRO), an antiprotozoal compound, as a potent colistin adjuvant that significantly enhanced colistin activity against both colistin-susceptible and colistin-resistant Gram-negative bacteria by markedly reducing the minimum inhibitory concentration. Mechanistically, BRO disrupts bacterial membrane integrity, increases membrane permeability and fluidity, collapses the proton motive force, induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, and depletes intracellular ATP, collectively disturbing bacterial homeostasis. Additionally, BRO exhibited high-affinity binding to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and attenuated subsequent LPS-induced inflammatory responses in host cells. In murine thigh and lung infection models, the BRO-colistin combination restored colistin efficacy in vivo , evidenced by significantly reduced bacterial loads. In the lung infection model, this combination further improved survival, alleviated pulmonary pathological damage, and reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Collectively, these findings support the BRO-colistin combination as a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome colistin resistance and combat MDR Gram-negative infections.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The World Health Organization has flagged the rise of drug resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus as a critical concern. Elevated mutation rates in this pathogen contribute to the rapid development of resistance, complicating treatment efforts. We conducted a study on the prevalence of azole resistance among clinical A. fumigatus isolates in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2022 and identified 34 cyp51A variants. To investigate the impact of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and combinations thereof on the azole phenotype in TR 34 -mediated resistance genotypes, we focused on novel, recent mutations and explored the effects of SNPs L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S and the combination of the mutations TR 34 /L98H, TR 34 /L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR 34 /L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S on azole affinity and susceptibility. We created the three-dimensional protein model of the Cyp51A protein with azoles, and the mutation was introduced to the wild-type cyp51A A. fumigatus strain by the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique. Finally, in vitro susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus strains carrying the mutations was conducted to confirm the azole phenotypes observed in clinical isolates. The MICs of all four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains, which harbored combination mutations, were higher than those of the wild type, with highly elevated MICs of itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. Genotypes TR 34 /L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S mutant showed a consistent phenotype to the clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole. In this study, we show that molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid substitutions in the cyp51A gene correlate to the structure–function relationship of in vitro phenotype.",

    "Abstract": "SUMMARY Antibiotic resistance is a major global health threat, with an estimated 1.14 million deaths in 2021 linked to antibiotic resistance. Mutations naturally arise as bacteria evolve to defend against and survive various environmental challenges, including those exerted by antibiotics. Both overuse and misuse of antibiotics can accelerate selection for resistant bacteria. Misuse can happen when antibiotic treatment ends prematurely, resulting in sub-lethal antibiotic levels. This provides an ideal environment for the proliferation of resistance-causing mutations, which, in some cases, are enhanced further by triggering the synthesis of error-prone DNA polymerases. Low levels of antibiotics are also found in the environment, creating breeding grounds for the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Mutations diminish the impact of antibiotics by three principal mechanisms: (i) reducing antibiotic influx, (ii) elevating antibiotic efflux, and (iii) altering cellular targets of antibiotics. The first two mechanisms confer modest resistance against a broad range of antibiotics; however, in combination with the third target-specific mechanism, they become the foundation of high-level antibiotic resistance. Ultimately, while the manifestation of mutations cannot be prevented, steps can be taken to lower their frequency by carefully considering the need for antibiotic prescription, exploring combination therapies, integrating adjuvants such as efflux pump inhibitors, and minimizing environmental contamination of antibiotics.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT To evaluate the association between respiratory tract microorganisms at birth and the subsequent development and severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants. This prospective cohort study enrolled 98 preterm infants (gestational age &lt; 32 weeks, birth weight &lt; 2,000 g). Tracheal aspirate samples were collected through endotracheal intubation within 2 h after birth. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, we characterized the airway microbiome and performed co-occurrence network analysis with compositionally robust methods. Among 98 preterm infants analyzed, the incidence of BPD was 68.4%, comprising 31 grade I, 20 grade II, and 16 grade III cases. Airway microbiota in infants with BPD exhibited distinct severity-stage patterns: Escherichia-Shigella and Streptococcus were significantly enriched in grade I, while Chryseobacterium increased markedly in grade III, accompanied by a significant reduction in Streptococcus . Microbial co-occurrence network analysis yielded three key insights. (i) Network complexity declined sharply with BPD severity, being sparsest in grade III. (ii) Distinct keystone taxa were identified across different groups: Acinetobacter and Fusobacterium in the non-BPD group; Brevundimonas and Fusobacterium in grade I; Fusobacterium and Acinetobacter at grade II and grade III. (iii) In a multivariable model adjusted for key clinical confounders, a higher microbial network density at birth was independently associated with a substantially reduced risk (OR = 0.12, P &lt; 0.05). The ecological architecture of the neonatal airway microbiome at birth, defined by network complexity and keystone taxa, is associated with BPD severity. This highlights microbial network stability as a novel factor and ecological interactions as a target for future research. IMPORTANCE Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains the most common chronic lung disease in preterm infants. While its pathogenesis is incompletely understood, the role of the early respiratory microbe is increasingly recognized. Previous studies have largely focused on individual pathogenic taxa, overlooking the complex ecological interactions within microbial communities. Our analysis reveals that the architecture of microbial co-occurrence networks in the neonatal airway varies significantly with BPD severity. Notably, network complexity decreased markedly as BPD severity increased. We identified specific keystone taxa uniquely associated with disease outcomes, suggesting that microbial ecosystem stability rather than individual species may be a critical factor in BPD pathogenesis. These findings shift the focus from single microbes to the stability of the microbial ecosystem as a novel risk factor for severe BPD, offering new avenues for risk stratification and early intervention.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The increasing incidence of canker and dieback symptoms in commercially important fruit orchards and adjacent ornamental trees in Fars Province, Iran, prompted an investigation into associated fungal pathogens. Surveys in 2023 and 2024 yielded several isolates from symptomatic pomegranate ( Punica granatum L.) and eucalyptus ( Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh.) trees, which were identified as Stilbocrea gracilipes based on morphological, physiological, and multi-locus phylogenetic analyses (ITS, tef1-α , and rpb2 loci). Pathogenicity tests showed that all recovered S. gracilipes isolates ( n = 23) cause dark brown lesions and wood discoloration in detached shoots of their respective hosts, with significant variation in aggressiveness. Cross-pathogenicity assessments using the most aggressive isolates on pomegranate and eucalyptus saplings revealed that isolates from original hosts were pathogenic to both plant species, inducing characteristic lesions and internal wood discoloration. Based on an assessment of eight pathogenicity traits, the pomegranate-obtained isolate (PM7-68) demonstrated more aggressiveness compared to the eucalyptus-obtained isolate (EU1-031). Furthermore, inoculated pomegranate saplings exhibited greater susceptibility than inoculated eucalyptus saplings, highlighting the potential threat of S. gracilipes to economically significant pomegranate orchards. Evaluation of pomegranate cultivar susceptibility to S. gracilipes isolates, using principal component analysis (PCA) and heatmap visualization, revealed clustering of disease severity into four distinct groups. The pomegranate cultivar ‘Malas-e-Danesiyah-e-Esfahani’ consistently exhibited high disease severity (level 4), identifying it as highly susceptible, while the cultivar ‘Kadro’ displayed reduced lesion development and slower disease progression (level 1), suggesting relative resistance. IMPORTANCE This study represents the first report of Stilbocrea gracilipes associated with canker and dieback on pomegranate and eucalyptus, and the first confirmation of its pathogenicity as a canker-causing fungus on woody hosts in Iran and globally. The ability of S. gracilipes to infect both fruit and ornamental trees, coupled with its cross-host infectivity, poses a potential risk to mixed cropping systems and natural ecosystems.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Acinetobacter baumannii is a leading cause of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) infections in intensive care units (ICUs), with global concern due to its resistance to nearly all antimicrobials. In 2024, the WHO reaffirmed carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii as a critical-priority pathogen. In Peru, over 97% of clinical A. baumannii isolates are carbapenem non-susceptible, yet the genomic features of local strains remain poorly characterized. We performed whole-genome sequencing of 19 XDR A. baumannii isolates collected from ICU patients at Hospital Nacional Dos de Mayo (Lima, Peru) between May 2023 and September 2024. Genomes were analyzed for sequence types (ST), capsular (KL) and lipooligosaccharide (OCL) loci, virulence and resistance genes, and phylogenetic relatedness. All isolates were XDR but remained susceptible to colistin. Fourteen isolates belonged to ST2, forming two closely related subgroups carrying KL2 or KL9 and OCL1, with low SNP distances, suggesting recent clonal expansion. These ST2 genomes lacked bla OXA-23 but carried bla OXA-72 . Two isolates were assigned to ST79, harboring KL13/OCL10 and bla OXA-23 , representing the first report of this resistance gene in Peruvian ST79 strains. Three isolates belonged to ST1079, forming a tight Peruvian clade genetically distant from public ST1079 genomes; all carried KL107/OCL3 and bla OXA-23 , indicating possible local emergence. Our study revealed the emergence in Peru of XDR A. baumannii lineages ST79 and ST1079 harboring bla OXA-23 and the spread of high-risk ST2 clones carrying bla OXA-72 , underscoring the need for enhanced genomic surveillance and targeted infection-control measures. IMPORTANCE A. baumannii is one of the most problematic hospital pathogens worldwide, often resistant to nearly all available antibiotics. In Peru, the proportion of carbapenem-resistant isolates is among the highest reported globally, yet their genetic background has remained largely unknown. This study provides the first genomic and phylogenomic insight into XDR A. baumannii from a major Peruvian hospital, revealing the spread of high-risk clones belonging to sequence type 2 carrying the OXA-72 carbapenemase, and the emergence of two additional lineages, sequence type 79 and sequence type 1079, both producing OXA-23. These findings demonstrate that multiple resistant lineages are established in Peru, highlighting the urgent need to implement genomic surveillance and infection control measures. Understanding the diversity and dynamics of these lineages is critical to limit their further spread and to guide public health responses in South America.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT SARS-CoV-2 infection causes neurological manifestations in 30%–40% of patients, with reinfection exacerbating sequelae risks. Elucidating neuroinvasion mechanisms requires optimized animal models overcoming limitations of existing systems. This study establishes the Syrian hamster as a neuroanatomically optimized model to investigate SARS-CoV-2 variant-specific neuropathogenesis. Syrian hamsters subjected to primary infection and reinfection with WH-09 and Omicron subvariants (XBB.1, BA.1, or BF.7) were investigated using multimodal MRI and histopathology. We demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibit strikingly differential neuroinvasive capacities following primary infection and reinfection. Notably, immune-evasive variants like XBB.1 and WH-09 induced significant, unresolved damage in olfactory-limbic regions, correlating with clinical symptoms such as hyposmia. BF.7 and BA.1 exhibited minimal neurostructural alterations in both primary and reinfection models. These variant-specific neuropathological profiles, precisely mapped via MRI-histopathology correlation, underscore the model’s utility in delineating the neurological threats posed by evolving variants. IMPORTANCE This study demonstrates that Syrian hamsters offer advantages for modeling SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis. WH-09 and XBB.1’s persistent olfactory and hippocampus damage, which was quantified through integrated MRI and histopathology, underscores the neurological threat posed by immune-evasive variants. Conversely, Omicron’s attenuated phenotype provides a blueprint for virulence-modifying interventions. This work establishes multimodal imaging in hamsters as an effective strategy for evaluating emerging viral variants.",

    "Abstract": "Aims The objective of this study was to explore the clinical diagnostic indicators and treatment approaches for intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL), particularly when it extends into the inferior vena cava and the right heart system. Methods Nine patients with IVL admitted to our hospital were enrolled in this study. The ultrasonographic, CT, MRI, pathological findings and surgical details of these patients were comprehensively analysed. All patients underwent surgical procedures. Postoperative pathological examination confirmed the presence of IVL, along with intramural leiomyoma of the uterus. Results Immunohistochemical results demonstrated that smooth muscle actin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, Desmin, Caldesmon, oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor were highly positive. The Ki-67 index of most specimens was &lt;3%, except for case 4. In case 4, which invaded the right atrium, the Ki-67 index ranged from 2% to 5%. Through molecular testing, this case with extension to the right atrium and inferior vena cava was identified as intraventricular smooth muscle neoplasia with fumarate hydratase deficiency. No copy number variation mutations were detected in all cases. Conclusions Although IVL is a rare histologically benign tumour, it exhibits the capacity to infiltrate cardiac chambers and pulmonary vasculature. Therefore, early diagnosis via imaging techniques, precise assessment of the extent of intravenous leiomyoma involvement, complete lesion resection and perioperative administration of anti-oestrogen medications are pivotal for enhancing patient prognosis. Additionally, for cases with atypical nuclei or high Ki-67 levels, multidisciplinary collaboration is required to personalised treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Some donor-conceived persons are born with an autosomal recessive genetic condition. In response, some fertility clinics categorically restrict the further use of the gametes from the donor who transmitted the pathogenic variant, although the chance of recurrence is usually very low. The level of specific risk that a recipient or physician is willing to accept depends on various factors, including severity, lived experiences and personal preferences. However, on a policy level, we argue for consistency and guidance on the principled question of whether the (further) use of gametes from donors who are carriers of a known pathogenic variant with autosomal recessive inheritance is acceptable. Provided that the identified risk is comparable to the general risk of genetic conditions, the continued use of the donor gametes can remain an acceptable option.",

    "Abstract": "Background The SpineJack system is a minimally invasive device designed to restore vertebral height and stability in vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates its clinical efficacy, safety, and potential advantages over conventional treatments. Methods A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched on July 20, 2024, for original clinical studies involving adult patients with VCFs treated using the SpineJack system. Studies reporting quantitative outcomes such as pain (Visual Analog Scale, VAS), disability (Oswestry Disability Index, ODI), and vertebral body height (VBH) restoration were included. Data were pooled using random-effects models, and publication bias was assessed through funnel plots and regression analysis. Results 18 studies comprising 1482 patients (930 treated with SpineJack) met the inclusion criteria. Fracture etiologies included osteoporotic, traumatic, and pathologic. Meta-analysis demonstrated significant reductions in pain (VAS standardized mean difference (SMD) 2.26, 95% CI 1.68 to 2.84, P&lt;0.001) and disability (ODI SMD 3.64, 95% CI 2.91 to 4.38, P&lt;0.001). Restoration of anterior VBH (SMD 1.45, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.78, P&lt;0.001, I²=0%), and middle VBH (SMD 3.93, 95% CI 1.51 to 6.34, P=0.001) were both significant. Reported complications were infrequent and primarily minor. Conclusion The SpineJack system provides a safe and effective minimally invasive option for VCF management, yielding considerable improvements in pain relief, functional recovery, and vertebral height restoration. Additional high-quality studies are warranted to further define its comparative advantages and long-term outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Background No disorder-specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) has yet been validated for functional movement disorders (FMDs), leaving a critical gap in clinical care and research. Objective To validate the FMD questionnaire (FMDQ) in a prospectively recruited sample through a multicentre study. Methods Confirmatory factorial analysis (CFA) tested the assumed structure of the questionnaire with factors reflecting severity of motor symptoms, impairment of everyday activities, impact of non-motor symptoms and impairment of social functioning. Internal consistency and floor/ceiling effects were examined. The 36-item short form health survey (SF-36), patient health questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15), the fatigue assessment scale (FAS) and a clinician-rated scale corresponding to motor symptom items of the FMDQ (FMDQ-CR) were used to test criterion and construct validity. The minimally clinically important difference (MCID) was assessed through distribution-based and anchor-based methods in a convenience sample of patients with follow-up assessments. Results Complete datasets from 157 patients were analysed; follow-up assessments were available from 30 patients. CFA confirmed that a four-factor model provides a better fit to the data compared with a more restrictive one-factor model. Internal consistency was appropriate for all factors/subscales. No floor or ceiling effects were detected. Criterion and content validity were supported by significant correlations with respective SF-36 subscores, PHQ-15, FAS and FMDQ-CR. Anchor-based MCID was estimated at 8 to 20 points, with the central value aligning with the distribution-based MCID of 12 points (8% of the total score range). Conclusions The FMDQ is a psychometrically robust PROM, making it a useful tool for clinical practice and treatment trials.",

    "Abstract": "Sodium-ion batteries have gained attention as a suitable alternative for lithium-ion batteries due to their analogous electrochemistry in addition to the availability and affordability of sodium. Among cathode materials for SIBs, Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF) is a promising candidate due to its rapid ion transport capability and high operating potential, however, NVPF is burdened by low energy density and slow ion diffusion rates. Herein, NVPF is doped with Ga to enhance structural stability and promote alternative Na+ diffusion pathways. A sol-gel method is used to synthesize three mixed V/Ga phases and a fully substituted Ga phase: Na3V2-xGax(PO4)F3, (x = 0.5, 0.7, 1, and 2). Powder XRD analysis reveals the mixed phase materials experience lattice contraction owing to increased Ga-content, while solid-state 23Na MAS NMR of pristine phases indicates oxidation of vanadium in surrounding Na local sites upon Ga addition. The electrochemical performance of the Na3V1.5Ga0.5(PO4)F3, (x = 0.5) cathode exhibited a specific capacity of 89 mAh g-1, 95% of the phase theoretical capacity. Ex-situ 23Na MAS NMR on cycled cathodes suggests the lower Ga-substituted phases exhibit a high level of oxidation and reversibility based on the degree of 23Na shift upon charge and discharge. However, higher Ga-substituted phases display a marginal 23Na shift difference during cycling, indicating minimal oxidation processes, which translates to reduced electrochemical performance. This report intends to observe the structural and electrochemical effects of Ga-doped NVPF, while reinforcing the advantages of NMR spectroscopy when investigating alkali-ion battery systems.",

A common approach is a multi-scan protocol, which reduces the risk of occlusion. To merge the different scans, identical reference points (targets) are necessary. However, the additional equipment required can be expensive and cumbersome. We tested three different target systems during field work in Ontario’s Boreal forest and compared each system’s cost, weight, precision, and ease of use. We found that currently used target configurations are typically expensive and heavy, but straightforward to use. We proposed an alternative target configuration, a monopod, which was inexpensive, lightweight and more precise; however, it was not suitable in all terrains. Our goal was to identify cost-effective and weight-efficient equipment alternatives to make lidar data acquisition more accessible.",

    "Abstract": "Communities are responding to increased wildfire in Canada by thinning and clearing forests in the wildland-urban interface to reduce hazardous fuel loads. The effects of these treatments on ecosystem structure and function, however, are poorly understood. This study examined effects of thinning second-growth forests, and patch clearcutting old-growth forests, on carbon stocks, stand structure, and understory diversity in the Cheakamus Community Forest, British Columbia. In the short term, thinning did not affect above- or belowground carbon stocks, but increased cover and richness of understory shrubs and herbs. Conversely, thinning reduced tree diversity, creating nearly pure Douglas-fir stands. Clearcutting old growth reduced aboveground carbon stocks and most measures of plant biodiversity but had no effect on mineral soil or forest floor carbon pools. These results suggest that thinning to reduce fuel can promote understory plant diversity without harming the forest floor, but care is needed to avoid overstory simplification.",

    "Abstract": "Global climate change (GCC), characterized mainly by rising temperatures and elevated carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels, is reshaping the delicate balance of what this review refers to as the “3 Ps”: plant-pest-pesticide interactions. Climate extremes weaken plant growth and modify defense chemistry, often increasing vulnerability to herbivores, while simultaneously shifting pest distribution, fitness, and resistance potential, particularly in regions where warming expands the overwintering range of major pests. Pesticides, the cornerstone of modern agriculture, often exhibit climate-sensitivity. Temperature, CO₂, and daily thermal fluctuations can significantly modulate the rates of absorption, metabolism, and degradation. These interactions rarely act in isolation. Instead, they create complex feedback loops that amplify both pest pressure and pesticide reliance, trapping agriculture in a “pesticide treadmill” amid a changing climate. Insects further complicate this cycle by adjusting their susceptibility through temperature-mediated modulation of detoxification enzymes and stress-response pathways. Elevated CO₂ and temperature further reshape soil-pesticide interactions, variably accelerating degradation or diminishing efficacy. Recognizing these complex and interconnected dynamics is essential for rethinking pest management. This review synthesizes current knowledge on how GCC reshapes the 3 Ps relationship, and advocates for a paradigm shift toward climate-smart, resilient pest management systems that secure agricultural productivity while reducing ecological risks.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In the development of city planning since the middle of the last century, there have been severe difficulties in generating more than a handful of plans to test. This is because we have largely lacked computational methods to generate a systematic evaluation of their performance. City plans have been too big in terms of the number of components comprising their form to test and too small in terms of numbers of alternative plans with which to make meaningful comparisons. However, we have almost reached the point with the advent of big data and massive computer memories where we can break through these barriers and begin to test an order of magnitude greater numbers of plans than anything possible hitherto. In this paper, we demonstrate how we are able to compare a multitude of very simple alternatives, by increasing the speeds of travel on the shortest links which define complex transportation networks, exploring whether or not small changes in large networks generate greater carbon reductions than bigger changes in those same networks. We are able to show that in many cases, this is the case: small changes lead to better plans reflecting lower carbon reduction than big changes. We argue that once we are able explore a wide range of alternatives, we are likely to come across many counterintuitive and counterfactual results that need to be considered where more than one plan is proposed and tested.",

Two approaches can be pursued in achieving this goal: pixelated detectors or monolithic detectors coupled to pixelated readouts. Here, we present the design of a thin monolithic position-sensitive detector for low-energy gamma-rays. Two distinct position-evaluation methods were developed and assessed in terms of accuracy, precision, and imaging capabilities. An analytical model based on a curve-fitting procedure established a performance baseline. A neural network model showed superior performance, offering notable improvements in both accuracy and precision. Qualitative evaluation of the imaging results provided insights into the inherent advantages and limitations of both models. The results demonstrate the ability of a thin monolithic scintillator detector to generate images that significantly surpass the resolution of the readout array for low-energy gamma-ray imaging.",

    "Abstract": "In the elastic scattering angular distributions of nuclei, the secondary rainbow manifests itself as an extra maximum (accompanied with a minimum as well) in the darkside of the primary rainbow. This phenomenon was first observed in the elastic scattering of [Formula: see text]O+[Formula: see text]C at around 300[Formula: see text]MeV. It is believed to be generated by the coupling to the first 2[Formula: see text] excitation of [Formula: see text]C and influenced by the couplings to other inelastic scattering channels. In this work, the optical potentials with a spline real part were utilized in the optical model analyses of the elastic scattering data of [Formula: see text]O+[Formula: see text]C at 300[Formula: see text]MeV and 330[Formula: see text]MeV. The spline real potentials were obtained by performing the data fitting starting from the phenomenological Woods–Saxon form and the double folding one, respectively. Through this approach, the secondary rainbow patterns of the two systems were reproduced well. The obtained spline real potentials exhibit an evident additional refraction (a potential pocket) at around [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]fm and show a preference to the shallow central depth. The semiclassical analyses were performed to learn the physical meaning of these obtained optical potentials. According to the nearside/farside decomposition, this secondary rainbow pattern was shown as the result of the farside scattering. In the deflection functions, a new minimum appears apart from the primary rainbow one, of which the former was proved to be related to the secondary rainbow maximum in the angular distribution. The potential pocket around [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]fm in the real potential was found responsible for the generation of the secondary rainbow pattern. However, the additional refraction caused by this potential pocket might not be associated with the Airy pattern. The present physical picture of the nuclear primary/secondary rainbow pattern is a two-refraction process originating from the non-monotonic repulsive-attractive real potential. Hence, the secondary rainbow pattern in the angular distribution corresponds to a complicated interference of the farside trajectories which distorts the original Airy oscillation pattern. Besides, for the phenomenological analysis of this pattern, a potential ambiguity was also found in the undulations of the real potential.",

    "Abstract": "Within the context of Rastall teleparallel gravity, we analyze two stellar models coupled with the anisotropic pressure distribution in their interior. The study initiates with the assumption of a static spherically symmetric geometry, from which we obtain modified gravitational equations exhibiting high nonlinearity. To derive exact solutions, we implement particular ansatz, namely, the Finch–Skea metric and the Karmarkar condition. For these metric choices, the governing equations are simplified significantly, allowing exact solutions to be derived. The integration constants appearing in these solutions are determined by applying junction conditions at the boundary, i.e. by matching the interior and exterior Reissner–Nordström spacetimes. The derived solutions are then validated against observational data from multiple known pulsars with a particular value of the coupling parameter.

    "Abstract": "This paper conducts a comprehensive comparison of the vibrational responses of elastic wheels and standard wheels under various excitation conditions. The investigation focuses on a frequency range spanning from 500 Hz to 3750 Hz, within which we observe that the radial modes of the elastic wheel tend to be relatively concentrated. This concentration can have significant implications for the performance and stability of the wheel during operation. One of the key findings of this study is that the mobility of the elastic wheel is notably higher than that of the standard wheel. This increased mobility is a double-edged sword; while it may enhance the wheel's ability to adapt to varying loads and road conditions, it also predisposes the elastic wheel to higher levels of rim vibration. Such vibrations can lead to potential issues in terms of ride comfort. The frequency spectrum beyond 3750 Hz, a marked difference in vibration levels between the two types of wheels becomes apparent. In this higher frequency range, the vibration levels experienced by the elastic wheel are several orders of magnitude lower than those of the standard wheel. This significant reduction in vibration can primarily be attributed to the unique properties of the rubber layer in the elastic wheel design. The rubber material acts as a crucial dampening agent, efficiently dissipating vibration energy that would otherwise contribute to increased noise and structural fatigue.",

This study examines the spatiotemporal evolution of terrestrial water storage (TWS) and groundwater storage (GWS) using GRACE satellite gravity data, GLDAS hydrological model data, and meteorological data. The results indicate an overall increase in TWS, with groundwater storage rising in the western region (west of Qumalai) since 2007, while declining in the eastern region. GWS shows little seasonal variation. The rapid temperature rise in the western part is identified as the primary driver of these changes.",

    "Abstract": "While unbiased gradient estimators ensure unbiased solutions in empirical risk minimization problems, they can significantly hinder optimization efficiency and generalization performance in strongly non-IID Federated Learning environments. Although recent studies have demonstrated promising applications of biased estimators, they typically focus only on convergence rates while overlooking generalization performance. We propose a novel multi-metric bias concept, quantified using both local loss and local gradient norm, along with a client activation method based on this bias concept. The proposed method prioritizes training on local datasets that better represent the global dataset, leading to faster convergence and improved generalization. Our extensive empirical study demonstrates that carefully injecting bias into client activation accelerates federated optimization, achieving a substantially improved validation accuracy within a given epoch budget. In representative machine learning benchmarks, our method achieves up to \\(12.7\\%\\) higher accuracy than uniform random sampling and \\(2.5\\%\\) higher accuracy than state-of-the-art biased client activation methods.",

    "Abstract": "Recently, Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered recommender systems have revolutionized personalized recommendation frameworks and attracted extensive attention. Despite the remarkable success, existing LLM-empowered RecSys have been demonstrated to be highly vulnerable to minor perturbations. To mitigate the negative impact of such vulnerabilities, one potential solution is to employ collaborative signals based on item-item co-occurrence to purify the malicious collaborative knowledge from the user’s irrelevant historical interactions. On the other hand, due to the capabilities to expand insufficient internal knowledge of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques provide unprecedented opportunities to enhance the robustness of LLM-empowered recommender systems by introducing external collaborative knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework ( RETURN ) by retrieving external collaborative signals to purify the poisoned user profiles and enhance the robustness of LLM-empowered RecSys in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, retrieval-augmented perturbation positioning is proposed to identify potential perturbations within the users’ historical sequences by retrieving external knowledge from collaborative item graphs. After that, we further retrieve the collaborative knowledge to cleanse the perturbations by using either deletion or replacement strategies and introduce a robust ensemble recommendation strategy to generate final robust predictions. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RETURN.",

    "Abstract": "Rust has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its safety and high performance. Despite these advantages, Rust projects rarely start from scratch in practice, and many Rust-based systems instead use hybrid programming, where Rust interoperates with existing C/C++ code. To reduce the manual effort involved in this interoperation (interop) process, several interop tools have been proposed to facilitate hybrid programming between Rust and C/C++. However, the challenges and limitations of these tools remain largely unexplored, leaving developers unclear about the future directions and users unclear about the appropriate usage scenarios. To fill the gap, we mined 320 bugs in the popular interop tools, i.e., Bindgen , Cbindgen , and CXX . We observe that the main obstacle is not tool crashes or performance issues, but the inability to generate correct and functional code. The leading types of the failures are generating code that is unfaithful to the original code's intent and generating incomplete code. Memory layout mismatch is the most common cause with Bindgen . Input with complex struct is the biggest challenge across tools, followed by the usage with specific tool configuration options for customized binding generation. Even input with primitive data types can be problematic. We also observe a common fix pattern that updates the control flow and condition. Based on our findings, we propose a series of suggestions to developers, users, and future researchers. For example, we suggest the developers validate configuration combinations, provide clearer documentation, and implement default-safe mechanisms to prevent failures related to unexpected tool configuration options.",

    "Abstract": "Macrophages are critical cellular mediators within the innate immune system and are the central effectors of chronic inflammation at the cellular level. Here, macrophages regulate the ongoing, simultaneous processes of tissue inflammation, destruction, and repair. They also play an integral role in recruiting key cell types within the inflammatory and wound healing response. Cancer is a chronic inflammatory state and largely considered a wound that does not heal. As in wound healing, where macrophages engulf and/or destroy foreign insults, macrophages have the potential to also eliminate tumor cells. However, it is now well known that these early pro-inflammatory, anti-tumor responses by macrophages are nullified as macrophages repolarize into pro-tumor, anti-inflammatory tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in response to tumor cell and microenvironmental-derived factors. After this point, TAMs drive neoplastic progression in multiple distinct ways. This indirect control of tumor progression, where TAMs share great functional overlap with the direct control elicited by neoplastic cells, supports TAMs being central orchestrators and later conductors of the tumor microenvironment (TME) – the focus of our review.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose: To determine the safety and efficacy of taselisib, a selective PI3K-inhibitor, in combination with tamoxifen. Patients and Methods: POSEIDON is a phaseII, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted from June 2016 to March 2020. Eligible patients were refractory upon prior endocrine therapy. Prior treatment with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors and everolimus was allowed. Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive either taselisib (4mg) + tamoxifen (20mg) or placebo + tamoxifen. The primary endpoint of the trial was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (two-sided alpha 0.2, 90% power). Exploratory biomarker analysis with regards to prognosis and treatment resistance were conducted in circulating tumor (ct)DNA. Results: POSEIDON met its primary endpoint, where patients treated with taselisib + tamoxifen had improved PFS compared to patients treated with placebo + tamoxifen in the ITT population (median PFS 4.8 months versus. 3.2 months; stratified hazard ratio 0.69, 80% CI 0.49-0.98, p=0.17). However, toxicity of taselisib was significant with diarrhea (40% any grade) as most common adverse event. Exploratory analyses indicated that high tumor fraction determined in ctDNA at baseline is associated with worse PFS and OS (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest efficacy of PI3K inhibition + tamoxifen beyond second-line treatment and after prior targeted therapies, including CDK4/6 inhibition in metastatic HR+/HER2- breast cancer although the magnitude of benefit did not outweigh the tolerability of this combination. Exploratory biomarker analysis indicates that tumor fraction determined in ctDNA differentiates patients based on prognosis and may help to optimize patient selection for targeted treatment strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose: The use of reversible FGFR inhibitors leads to the emergence of \"undruggable\" FGFR2 kinase domain mutations, hampering sequential treatment strategies. Lirafugratinib and futibatinib are irreversible FGFR inhibitors with the most promising clinical activity against FGFR2-driven tumors. Experimental design: We characterized resistance to lirafugratinib with circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), tissue whole exome sequencing and bulk-RNA sequencing in 30 patients with FGFR2-driven cancers, treated in the phase 1/2 ReFocus trial (NCT04526106) and enrolled in the UNLOCK program at Gustave Roussy. Results: Among the 30 patients included, 18 (60%) had intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and 12 (40%) had other tumor types. Twenty-two patients (73%) were FGFR inhibitor-naïve. Among those experiencing primary resistance to lirafugratinib, we identified potential resistance mechanisms in 5 of 6 pre-treatment samples. Patients with acquired lirafugratinib resistance manifested an unprecedented emergence of FGFR2 mutations in the M538 and/or L618 residues of the kinase domain, documented in 11/16 cases (69%). Compared to futibatinib resistance, FGFR2 molecular brake (N550) and gatekeeper (V565) mutations were rare. Leveraging the spectrum of FGFR2 kinase domain mutations at resistance to lirafugratinib and futibatinib respectively, we identified the complementarity of the two irreversible inhibitors. On the basis of viability assays in FGFR2::BICC1 dependent Ba/F3 models and in vivo studies on patient-derived xenografts, we propose treatment sequences with the two agents. After lirafugratinib progression, three patients received futibatinib and experienced prolonged disease response. Conclusions: The complementary activity of lirafugratinib and futibatinib against FGFR2 kinase domain mutations supports their sequential use, when precise resistance mutations are detected in patients.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Endometrial cancer (EC) incidence continues to rise globally, driven mainly by obesity. Current diagnostic pathways rely on symptom presentation; no validated approach exists to identify asymptomatic individuals who may benefit from targeted prevention. The Progesterone Challenge Test (PCT) is a physiologic assessment of endometrial hormonal responsiveness that could pragmatically guide EC prevention interventions. The RESToRE study (NCT05651282) prospectively assessed the feasibility of the PCT as a community-based risk-stratification tool for EC prevention in British Columbia, Canada, between 2023 and 2024. Asymptomatic postmenopausal participants, defined by the absence of vaginal bleeding, with body mass index ≥34.9 kg/m² and an intact uterus, completed a 10-day course of oral medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 10 mg daily. Feasibility, tolerability, and acceptability were evaluated. Of 96 eligible individuals, 68 enrolled, 53 initiated, and 51 completed the PCT. Sixteen participants experienced withdrawal bleeding (+PCT) (30.2% of those with evaluable results). All +PCT individuals were referred to a gynecologist for standard-of-care evaluation, including an endometrial biopsy. Among the 15 who underwent biopsy, 2 had a proliferative endometrium, and 1 had simple hyperplasia. Participants and providers found the test acceptable, citing its simplicity and low administrative burden. Side effects were mild (median severity ≤ 3/10), resulting in 3.8% (2/53) of participants discontinuing the MPA. The PCT was feasible, well-tolerated, and acceptable among higher-risk postmenopausal individuals, supporting its use as a physiologic, functional biomarker of endometrial responsiveness. These findings provide early evidence for a scalable, low-cost strategy to identify individuals likely to benefit from targeted EC prevention.",

Involvement of the lacrimal gland is exceedingly rare and has been previously reported in two case reports. Case Presentation This report discusses a 71-year-old male who presented with a painful red left eye. There was notable swelling of the upper eyelid, which was confirmed on CT to be due to lacrimal gland inflammation. Clinical features of dacryoadenitis associated with scleritis were found upon assessment by ophthalmology. Conjunctival swabs were sent for culture and returned positive for NG, following which the patient reported a new sexual encounter previously unknown to the treating clinicians. Following IV ceftriaxone and flucloxacillin, topical steroid and chloramphenicol eye drops, the patient saw marked clinical improvement. Conclusion This case demonstrates that NG may present with unusual features, and clinicians should have a low threshold for conjunctival cultures and promptly explore the sexual and social histories of patients presenting with similar symptomology.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is uncommon among inpatients already admitted to the hospital for other indications. Prior studies reported significant differences in clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients who develop STEMI while hospitalized versus those who present with out-of-hospital STEMI. However, prior studies were small or not contemporary. METHODS: We compared the characteristics and outcomes of patients presenting with STEMI at the time of hospital admission (preadmission STEMI) versus in-hospital STEMI (occurring during the hospitalization) using data from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Chest Pain-MI Registry from 2019 to 2022. RESULTS: A total of 112 590 patients (3.8% in-hospital STEMI, 96.2% preadmission STEMI) from 670 hospitals were included. Patients with in-hospital STEMI were significantly older (median age, 67 versus 63 years), more likely to be diabetic (37.6% versus 29.6%) and have CHF (13.7% versus 6.0%) compared with preadmission STEMI patients (all P &lt;0.001). The median (interquartile range) time from ECG to first device activation (81 minutes [61–110] versus 69 [55–84]; P &lt;0.0001) and time from cath laboratory arrival to first device time (28 minutes [21–39] versus 23 [18–30]; P &lt;0.001) were significantly longer for in-hospital compared with preadmission STEMI patients. The incidence of major bleeding (25.5% versus 7.1%), cardiogenic shock (19.7% versus 7.0%), and cardiac arrest (22.3% versus 7.3%) were all significantly higher in the in-hospital STEMI cohort (all P &lt;0.001), as was mortality (25.9% versus 5.6%; adjusted OR, 5.7 [95% CI, 5.0–6.4]; P &lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who experience in-hospital STEMI represent a high-risk group, with significantly longer times from the diagnostic ECG to primary percutaneous coronary intervention, more complications, and higher mortality.",

    "Abstract": "The high frequency of opioid overdose deaths often involves co-use of alcohol, which is reported in approximately 30% of fentanyl fatalities. Both substances depress respiratory function, and their combined effects can be lethal. The present study investigated physiological parameters of respiratory-depressant effects of fentanyl when co-administered with alcohol and its sensitivity to naloxone reversal using whole-body plethysmography in male and female Long-Evans rats. Administration of a high, sedative-like dose of alcohol alone or fentanyl alone resulted in no mortality, but fentanyl+alcohol led to mortality rates of 42% and 33% in females and males, respectively. The fentanyl+alcohol combination reduced minute ventilation and increased apneic pauses compared with either drug alone. Lower, binge-like alcohol doses, when combined with fentanyl, also amplified respiratory depression. Pretreatment with naloxone did not fully restore normal respiration. Naloxone administered after fentanyl+alcohol transiently reversed the decrease in minute ventilation but did not reverse apneic pauses. Fentanyl-dependent rats were partially tolerant to fentanyl- and fentanyl+alcohol-induced respiratory depression, but alcohol-dependent rats exhibited sensitization to alcohol- and fentanyl+alcohol-induced apnea. These findings highlight physiological parameters of severe respiratory risks with fentanyl+alcohol co-use, which are inadequately reversed by naloxone, underscoring the need for targeted strategies to manage opioid+alcohol overdoses.",

    "Abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT) is a central treatment for prostate cancer (PCa), acting by inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Tumor ability to repair these breaks limits RT efficacy, making DSB repair inhibitors potential radiosensitizers. Therefore, tumor-specific radiosensitization strategies are critically needed for PCa. Approximately 50% of PCa cases harbor the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion, leading to overexpression of the ERG transcription factor (ERG+). We demonstrate that ERG+ tumors shift DSB repair toward the PARP1-dependent end-joining (PARP1-EJ) pathway. Proteomic and western blot analyses revealed elevated PARP1, XRCC1, and LIG3 in ERG+ cells. PARP inhibition with olaparib increased residual γH2AX/53BP1 foci post-irradiation in ERG+ cells, indicating enhanced radiosensitization. In tissue-slice-cultures (TSCs) from 53 tumors of 40 high-risk PCa patients, olaparib selectively increased H2AX/53BP1 foci selectively in ERG+ samples. ERG+ patient-derived organoids also showed significantly delayed growth and survival when treated with olaparib plus RT compared to either treatment alone. Interestingly, ERG-negative cells within ERG+ TSCs were similarly radiosensitized by olaparib, likely through bystander effect, with residual 53BP1 foci levels comparable to ERG+ cells, confirmed by medium exchange experiments. These findings suggest that ERG expression promotes dependency on PARP1-EJ, rendering ERG+ PCa more susceptible to PARP inhibition. Combining PARP inhibitors with RT may offer a tumor-selective radiosensitization for ERG+ PCa patients.",

    "Abstract": "Access to people behind bars is limited and contributes to a lack of real-time knowledge about incarceration and its impacts. This mixed-methods study examines how individuals housed in a county jail perceive the effects of incarceration on their lives, relationships, and sense of self. Using a cross-sectional design, 23 participants completed a quantitative questionnaire and in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Findings indicate that the predominantly White male sample reported high exposure to Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), early substance use, and substance use patterns that shaped pathways into incarceration. Qualitative data revealed participants’ identity negotiation under confinement, with two intersecting orientations emerging: a collective struggle orientation and a personal accountability orientation. Readiness for change was more strongly associated with personal accountability when embedded in meaningful family relationships. Together, these findings support a Relational–Identity Accountability perspective, highlighting the importance of trauma-informed, family-centered substance use interventions and policies that extend beyond punitive responses to incarceration.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic diseases place substantial cognitive and emotional demands. Utilizing adaptive strategies can mitigate these challenges and enhance mental health outcomes. However, research is limited among individuals living with chronic conditions, especially in non-western contexts. We examined the relationship between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and mental health outcomes among individuals living with chronic conditions in Ghana. Using cross-sectional data from 801 participants (mean age = 46.61 years, SD = 16.21), we used multiple regression models to estimate associations between specific strategies and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Positive refocusing, self-blame, refocus on planning, and putting into perspective were found to negatively associated with depression, anxiety, and stress. In contrast, rumination, positive appraisal and blaming others, were positively associated with depression, anxiety and stress. These findings emphasize the need for targeted mental health interventions that promote adaptive emotion regulation strategies to enhance mental health for individuals with chronic conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Cryptocurrency, as a transformative financial innovation, has reshaped global financial ecosystems while simultaneously introducing new risks of money laundering. To address these challenges, regulators increasingly employ AI-driven Regulatory Technology (RegTech) to strengthen anti-money laundering (AML) enforcement. Yet, this study reveals that the primary aim of crime prevention through RegTech generates unintended consequences by colliding with personal data protection laws, creating a profound regulatory and ethical paradox. Employing an exploratory qualitative approach, this study integrates semi-structured interviews with RegTech providers and document analysis, analysed through Braun and Clarke’s thematic framework. Findings reveal three central themes: the conflict between RegTech and personal data protection, the imbalance between AML requirements and data subject rights, and the dilemma of the presumption of innocence in RegTech implementation. Theoretically, the study contributes by applying Situational Crime Prevention (SCP) and Solove’s Taxonomy of Privacy to conceptualise how Know Your Data (KYD) mechanisms, while effective in deterring crime, risk infringing individual privacy. Practically, the results emphasise the urgent need for regulators, RegTech developers, and Crypto FinTech institutions to design adaptive governance frameworks that balance AML compliance with data protection principles. This study thus establishes a foundation for future research into privacy-enhancing technologies and equitable data governance, advancing interdisciplinary discourse at the intersection of AI, financial regulation, and digital rights.

    "Abstract": "Background: The digitalization of clinical research has increased reliance on electronic portals (e-portals), with significant implications for trial site operations. Our aim is to map the types and number of e-portals required for clinical trials on solid tumors conducted at the Niguarda Cancer Center. Methods: We performed an aggregated analysis of 65 interventional drug trials (phase I–III) initiated between August 2022 and March 2025. For each study, the number and type of e-portals required at the site were recorded and stratified by sponsor type. Analyses were conducted using R. Results: A total of 65 trials were included (57 industry-sponsored, 8 academic). The mean number of e-portals per study was 5.3, with 66.1% of trials requiring 5–7 portals. Industry-sponsored trials employed significantly more e-portals than academic ones (mean ± SD: 5.8 ± 1.7 vs. 1.13 ± 0.35; t(41)=22.10, p&lt;0.0001). Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems were universally implemented (100%). Additional portals for randomization (IXRS), central laboratories, imaging, and safety reporting were common in industry-sponsored trials but rarely used in academic studies. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were included in ~49% of industry and 88% of academic trials; 89% of PROs in industry studies were captured via ePRO portals, while academic trials mostly relied on paper forms or EDC integration. Conclusions: Industry-sponsored oncology trials impose a high digital workload on sites. Vendor streamlining, single sign-on solutions, open API standards, and shared ePRO infrastructures could improve efficiency, interoperability, and data quality.",

    "Abstract": "In the field of fault diagnosis and engine functional health management, onboard sensor analytical redundancy modeling serves as a critical technology. However, the modeling of analytical redundancy models for engine parameters is challenged by hardware constraints and the demand for high precision. This paper proposes a modeling method for Onboard Sensor Analytical Redundancy Model (OSARM) based on flight data, which combines the advantages of high precision, fast computation, and small storage footprint. The steady-state portion is established using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence Minimization K-Means Algorithm (KLDK-Means), with the baseline model of the engine obtained through a Physics-Based Model (PBM). Considering the impact of inlet operating conditions on the distribution of steady-state data, the accuracy of the steady-state baseline model is further improved by constructing a Modified Baseline Model (MBM). The dynamic modeling portion innovatively introduces the concept of nonlinear levels and employs the Nonlinear Levels Seeker Optimization Algorithm (NL-SOA) to construct a dynamic model, which improves upon traditional dynamic error optimization methods. The proposed method is validated using real flight data. The results show that compared to the Hammerstein model, OSARM achieved a reduction in maximum error of 32.4%. The modeling approach presented in this paper meets the requirements for precision modeling while satisfying the need for fast computation and small storage footprint.",

    "Abstract": "The initial dispersal routes and subsequent exchange networks of Austronesian speaking populations in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) and Near Oceania continue to be debated. Accurate and precise chronologies on pottery assemblages are key in clarifying these population movements and dynamics. Previous scholars have suggested red-slipped pottery may be a proxy for Malayo-Polynesian speakers’ presence, and Lapita pottery may be a proxy for Proto-Oceanic speakers. Under this premise, pottery assemblages found between eastern Indonesia and the Bismarck Archipelago have the potential to inform us about the arrivals and movements of new Austronesian languages to the region and their possible connections with Lapita peoples that voyaged into the Pacific. The generally poor resolution of the archaeological and radiocarbon record from this part of the Pacific calls for more research to settle the debate. Mololo Cave is a site in the Raja Ampat Islands off the western coast of New Guinea, containing the earliest reported pottery assemblages in the area, including red-slipped and plainware Lapitoid pottery. This paper presents 11 new radiocarbon dates and Mololo’s first two Bayesian age models to increase the robusticity of the date estimates at the site and enable chronological comparisons with similar pottery assemblages from the region. Most of the pottery sherds, including both red-slipped and Lapitoid pottery, emerge after 3090–2258 cal BP, potentially being as early as 3903–3420 cal BP. This chronological model provides critical information about the dispersal of pottery-making groups around the far western Pacific during the initial expansion of Austronesian languages into the region.",

    "Abstract": "Why is degrowth being sidelined by some of its highest profile populist writers? Is the term degrowth too negative and neo-Malthusian? Should degrowth be treated as a quantitative reduction in economic growth or GDP? Is degrowth drifting from its origins? What happened to degrowth's foundational concerns for limits to growth and stopping the imperialist spread of growth as development? Are pragmatic political alliances now creating fundamental contradictions? Answering such questions this article probes into the attempts to unify disparate theories and ideas and the rise of alliances under the banner of post-growth. The compatibility of four approaches is probed based on high profile advocates public speeches: degrowth (Giorgos Kallis), post-growth (Tim Jackson), doughnut economics (Kate Raworth) and steady-state economics (Timothy Parrique). The speeches are primarily the plenary presentations given at the two major European Parliament conferences profiling the degrowth community within policy-making circles: Post-Growth 2018 and Beyond Growth 2023. Uncritical broad alliances are brought into question as conflicting with creating meaningful and coherent understanding. Three issues are then discussed further: conceptualising the growth imaginary, the reality of limits, and development within planetary boundaries. The analysis suggests a series of ways forward using critical realism as under-labourer. These include applying rational judgement to choose between theories, realism in conceptualisation, and investigating causal mechanisms and structure to identify potentiality for systems change.",

    "Abstract": "Age estimation is a critical aspect of forensic identification, particularly in adults, where traditional skeletal markers become less reliable. Cranial suture closure, though controversial, remains a valuable parameter, especially when population-specific standards are applied. This study aimed to assess the correlation between cranial suture closure and chronological age in the Gujarati population. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 medicolegal autopsy cases (50 males, 50 females) aged 13–78 years. Suture closure was assessed using the Acsadi-Nemeskeri scoring system across 16 defined cranial segments. Both endocranial and ectocranial surfaces were examined. In this study, Sagittal sutures closed earliest (30s), followed by coronal (40s), and lambdoid (50+), with near-complete fusion by 60 years. Endocranial closure demonstrated slightly higher accuracy (85%, MAE ± 4.2 years) compared to ectocranial (81%, MAE ± 4.8 years). Correlation with age was strongest for endocranial sagittal sutures (r = 0.946). No significant gender differences were observed. The findings indicate cranial suture closure, particularly endocranial sagittal fusion, is a reliable, gender-independent method for age estimation in the Gujarati population. It is most accurate in individuals aged 30–60 years and should be incorporated into forensic protocols alongside other age indicators.",

In order to improve a culture of patient safety, it is important for medical students who will start the profession, as well as health professionals, to know patient safety before graduation. The study aims to assess the attitudes of medical students to patient safety culture and the notification of medical error. The study has been conducted with a total of 1,278 volunteer students from the Faculties of Medicine in Turkey. A web-based survey was administered to medical students. It was found that the attitudes of medical students to the culture of patient safety are generally moderate (64.06 ± 18.55 and 69.0 [IQR: 59.8–75.9]), and few of the students (32.3%) who witnessed a medical error shared the malpractice with someone. There was almost no education on patient safety during medical school. The students in the fourth grade got higher scores in disclosure responsibility compared to those in the other grades. In the study, age was significantly linearly and negatively correlated with the scores of error reporting confidence, team functioning, patient’s role in error subscales and total score. We concluded that the attitudes of medical students to patient safety culture and the notification of medical errors should be developed and supported by the faculty management. Furthermore, this study creates an awareness in terms of the application of about patient safety at training programme in medicine faculties in Turkey.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To compare the incidence of ocular abnormalities in patients with metopic craniosynostosis (MCS) treated with cranial vault reconstruction (CVR) versus endoscopic suturectomy (ESC). Design Retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX Research Network. Setting Multi-institutional electronic health record database. Patients, Participants A total of 588 pediatric patients with non-syndromic MCS (441 CVR, 147 ESC) were identified by ICD-10 and CPT codes. Propensity score matching and age adjustment were performed to reduce confounding. Interventions Subjects underwent either CVR or ESC. Ocular and surgical complication outcomes were assessed. Main Outcome Measure(s) Primary outcome is ocular abnormalities. Secondary outcomes include surgical complications and reoperations. Results Ocular abnormalities were present in 40.31% of MCS patients. CVR was associated with a significantly higher incidence compared to ESC (44.67% vs 27.21%; RR = 1.64; 95% CI: 1.23-2.18). CVR patients had greater rates of strabismus (15.19% vs 7.48%; RR = 2.03; 95% CI: 1.10-3.74), ametropia (29.71% vs 11.56%; RR = 2.57; 95% CI: 1.58-4.20), and astigmatism (15.87% vs 2.72%; RR = 5.84; 95% CI: 2.17-15.70). These differences remained significant after adjusting for age and matching by sex, race, and ethnicity. The ESC group showed ocular outcomes comparable to the general pediatric population. Conclusions Patients with metopic craniosynostosis have a high rate of ocular abnormalities, and there may be a difference between those who undergo CVR versus ESC. These findings underscore the need for routine ophthalmologic surveillance and future prospective studies are needed to confirm the findings.",

    "Abstract": "Roughly 1.8 million individuals were detained or incarcerated in U.S. correctional facilities in 2022. Prior research has found that incarcerated persons are at increased risk for foodborne outbreaks. We aim to summarize recent national outbreak surveillance data and describe the nexus between disease burden and the law to inform prevention efforts. First, we describe epidemiological data for single-state correctional and all noncorrectional foodborne outbreaks during 1998–2022 that were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System. Second, we summarize state statutes and regulations for seven key food safety provisions in the 10 states with the largest incarcerated populations. Incarcerated and detained individuals experience nearly seven times as many outbreak-associated illnesses per 100,000 individuals than the public. Further, the median number of illnesses per outbreak in correctional settings is nearly six times greater than noncorrectional settings. All 10 states codified all or most of the seven food safety provisions for food service establishments, whereas express legal requirements instituting these provisions within correctional facilities were largely absent. Legal interventions, rigorous food safety practices, and collaborations with health departments are critical tools needed to reduce foodborne outbreaks in correctional facilities.",

In general, the mean stress within the epitrochoidal inclusion and its supplement to the circular domain is non-uniform. However, when the ratio of the shear modulus of the coating to that of the circular domain is analytically determined for given geometric and material parameters, the mean stress within the epitrochoidal inclusion and its supplement to the circular domain can indeed remain uniform. In order to accomplish this uniformity property, a thin coating with a rigidly clamped boundary can be replaced by a spring-type interface, and a thin coating with a traction-free boundary can be replaced by a membrane-type interface.",

    "Abstract": "This paper examines how sociology can think cinematically through the creation of sociological film, achieved by blending sociological and filmic imaginations. While traditional visual sociology often treats film as a tool for data collection, this study argues that cinema functions as a medium of thought that constructs and communicates social knowledge through image, rhythm and affect. Drawing on Just Black? (1992), Talking Heads (1980), Anything Can Happen (1995) and Chronicle of a Summer (1961), the paper demonstrates how cinematic form can embody key dimensions of sociological imagination, such as lived experience, structure–actor relations and reflexivity. By analysing how interviews and framing translate sociological inquiry into visual language, it highlights film's potential to generate affective, collaborative and public modes of understanding. The study concludes that sociological film transforms the camera from an instrument of observation into a participant in thought, making the sociological imagination visible and experiential.",

    "Abstract": "Background Intraplaque neovascularization (IPN) is related to the progression of atherosclerotic plaque. The impact of lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) on IPN regression is unclear. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of LLT to regress IPN. Methods Between April 2022 and July 2024, 56 patients who had percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for angina or acute coronary syndrome and had not used LLT for at least 6 months were included. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) of the carotid artery was performed to evaluate IPN and intima–media thickness (IMT) within 7 days post-PCI. They received a combination of rosuvastatin 10 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg starting after PCI and continued for 1 year. Lipid profile changes and contrast enhancement were evaluated at baseline and 1 year later. The primary outcome was IPN regression, defined as the downgrade changes in the enhancement of contrast in atherosclerotic plaque at follow up. Results The mean follow up was 12.6 ± 0.9 months. The IPN regression rate was 41%. Patients achieving IPN regression initially had a higher low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) level and a greater percentage reduction in LDL-C. Whereas lipid profiles change significantly, no notable alterations were observed in IMT, plaque thickness, or plaque density. However, a 59% reduction in LDL-C was identified as the optimal cutoff level for IPN regression (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75–0.96). Conclusion LLT, such as rosuvastatin 10 mg with ezetimibe 10 mg, may effectively inhibit IPN by reducing LDL-C levels, providing a promising treatment option.",

    "Abstract": "Social connection is a key health determinant yet remains under-researched in long-term conditions marked by isolation such as hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS). Individuals with hEDS are especially vulnerable due to the condition’s complex and often misunderstood symptoms. This study presents the first high-powered quantitative investigation ( n = 401) of perceived social support and companionship in hEDS. Using validated, theory-informed measures, we examined whether loneliness, support from family and friends, and dog guardianship predicted physical, mental, and social wellbeing outcomes. Loneliness was the most robust and consistent predictor, linked to poorer outcomes. Support from friends predicted some wellbeing indicators, whereas family support and dog guardianship had minimal predictive value. These findings have practical implications: interventions targeting loneliness and peer connection may be more effective than generalised or pet-based support. This research offers a novel contribution to understanding social determinants in chronic, stigmatised conditions, with relevance for intervention design and health policy.",

    "Abstract": "The mechanical performance of the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printed polylactic acid (PLA) parts is influenced by the printing and filament extrusion parameters. In this regard, this work focusses on the investigation of the effects of filament extrusion zonal temperatures and printing temperatures on the porosity and mechanical strength of the printed parts. Firstly, the working temperature range of the PLA is estimated as 180°C to 220°C using the Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Based on this, the filament is extruded using a single screw extruder with varying zonal temperatures in the increments of 5,10 and 15°C. Followed by that, the filaments are printed at various nozzle temperatures between 180°C and 220°C. The results showed that the zonal temperature difference of 10°C and the nozzle temperature of 200°C yields the lowest porosity of 1.2% and highest tensile strength of 49.18 MPa, highest compression strength of 60.89 MPa and flexural strength of 70.19 MPa. This enhanced performance is attributed to the gradual thermal gradient, proper polymer chain alignment and randomized layer bonding in the material. The results provide understandings on the significance of thermal parameters on the structural integrity and mechanical performance of the printed parts.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the integration of telehealth into routine health care, especially within Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). Few studies have compared patient experiences and/or comments about telehealth versus in-person visits. Methods: We compared patient comments about primary care telehealth versus in-person visits. We examined 3,795 comments from patient experience surveys (1,457 telehealth and 2,338 in-person) collected electronically between April 2023 and March 2024 by a large Southern California FQHC. We coded comment valence, content, and actionability. Results: Patient comments about telehealth visits were shorter (mean = 13 words) than comments about in-person visits (mean = 30 words) and more positive (85% versus 81%, respectively). Comments about telehealth visits were also less likely to mention specific provider or staff behaviors, resulting in fewer actionable comments: 7% of comments about telehealth and 12% about in-person visits were deemed actionable. Most comments about telehealth and in-person visits focused on overall visit experience, rather than specific aspects of care. References to care setting and staff roles were minimal, particularly in telehealth comments. Conclusion: While telehealth visits are generally well-received, patient comments about telehealth provide less detail and contain less actionable information compared to comments about in-person visits. The proportion of actionable comments was considerably lower than prior studies (∼30%). This may pose challenges to using comments to improve telehealth. Understanding differences in how patients respond to the same open-ended patient experience survey question about their telehealth versus in-person visit is critical for optimizing telehealth care delivery and addressing patient needs in under-resourced settings.",

    "Abstract": "Non-aureus staphylococci (NAS) and mammalicocci (collectively NASM) are coagulase-negative staphylococci, though they are less well-known than Staphylococcus aureus . Certain species within the NASM group have been associated with foodborne illnesses due to their ability to produce enterotoxins that are similar to those produced by S. aureus . In this study, 180 samples of ready-to-eat foods were examined, including 30 samples each of soybean cheese, cow milk cheese, yogurt, and meat pie, along with 60 samples of mixed vegetables. Isolation of the bacteria was performed using selective culture media technique, followed by biochemical testing, including a coagulase test. The taxonomic characterization of NASM was carried out using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and antibiotic susceptibility was done using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Of the total samples examined, 133 exhibited bacterial growth on Mannitol Salt Agar. This included samples of soybean 27 (15%), cow milk cheese 30 (16.67%), mixed vegetables 39 (21.67%), yogurt 27 (15%), and meat pie 10 (5.56%). Among these isolates, 20 (15.037%) displayed nonpigmented characteristic growth on nutrient agar and were subsequently subjected to biochemical testing. Specifically,9 (45%) of the isolates were identified as M. sciuri , 2 (10%) as S. edaphicus , 3 (15%) as S. arlettae , 1 (5%) as S. hominis , 2 (10%) as S. gallinarum , and 3 (15%) as S. ureilyticus. Approximately 90% of the isolates showed resistance to three or more antibiotics, with isolates 11, 16, and 21 showing resistance to five or more antibiotics. The result indicated M. scuiri as a frequent contributor to ready-to-eat food contamination, and three of the strains showed multidrug resistance. Although the risk of foodborne illness may be relatively low in NASM, the potential for the spread of antibiotic resistance genes to more pathogenic species of the family Staphylococcaceae such as S. aureus remains a significant concern.",

    "Abstract": "Inverse kinematics (IK) is a fundamental problem in robotics that involves computing the joint parameters necessary to achieve the desired position and orientation of a robotic manipulator's end-effector. Traditional methods for solving IK such as Jacobian-based solvers, pseudo-inverse methods, and numerical solvers such as Levenberg-Marquardt and Newton-Raphson are faced with serious challenges ranging from local minimum, singularity, computational cost, and the inability to handle highly redundant systems effectively. To address some of these problems, we proposed Multi-layered Graph Convolutional Neural Network (MGCNN) for 7-DOF (Degree-Of-Freedom) redundant manipulators. The architecture consists of 7 GCN (Graph Convolutional Network) blocks each block consists of a GCN layer, normalization, and activation functions followed by 2 fully connected layers for joint regression. A skip-connection mechanism was used to pool and concatenate outputs from all GCN blocks before being fed into the fully- connected (FC) layers of the network which ensures optimal feature utilization across all layers. The model was trained on mixed data (preplanned trajectories and random poses), where each pose of the robotic arm is represented as a graph with joints and kinematic links representing nodes and edges of the graph respectively. Node features consist of the global end-effector poses and local Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters, enabling the network to learn both global and joint-specific relationships. Experimental results demonstrate strong generalization, a narrow confidence interval relative to Mean Absolute Error (MAE), low error susceptibility, and fast inference. The model achieves an MAE below 0.001 compared to ground truth, proving its robustness and efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Two experiments investigated the role of task set in processing the direction indicated by arrows and words. In Experiment 1, in one block of trials, participants made S-R compatible manual responses to a left-or-right-pointing arrow in the presence of either a congruent or incongruent word (LEFT/ RIGHT); in another block, they responded to the direction signalled by a word in the presence of a congruent or incongruent arrow. Task set was, therefore, simple in each block—respond to only one of the two stimulus types. Yet an incongruent word did not interfere with responding to an arrow’s direction whereas an incongruent arrow robustly interfered with responding to the direction signalled by a word. In Experiment 2, targets were instead defined in terms of a fixed location (for one group, the distractor appeared below the target; for another group, the distractor appeared above the target) such that the target on any trial could be either a word or an arrow. Task set now was more complex in that target type varied unpredictably across trials. Distractor words now interfered with arrows, and distractor arrows interfered with words more than they did in Experiment 1. These results require a more integrative account that embeds S-R compatibility within a larger framework involving contextually driven modulation of task set.",

    "Abstract": "Multiple-object tracking (MOT) involves monitoring the positions of multiple targets as they move among identical distractors. Pylyshyn proposed that the mechanisms employed to track targets in MOT are also integral to coordinated actions. In support of this, previous research demonstrates that MOT and visually guided touch interfere with one another. However, in these early studies, reporting the MOT targets at the end of the trial involved touching them, making it unclear whether interference reflected competition for a shared limited-capacity item individuation mechanism or similarity in the motor responses required by the two tasks. To address this issue, we had participants touch items that changed colour during MOT with the index finger of their dominant hand and manipulated how participants later reported MOT targets at the end of the trial. We compared performance when participants reported MOT targets by touching them with the index finger of their dominant hand with that when they identified targets verbally or by typing them in. Two findings emerged. First, the target report method had an effect on the size of the difference between single and dual task performance (general interference). Second, the target report method had no effect on differential interference (the size of the dual-task performance advantage when participants touched targets rather than distractors during MOT). The dissociation between the effects of target report on general and differential interference suggest these two types of interference reflect different processes. This research has implications for those who study the formation of action plans.",

    "Abstract": "Background The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 study and population-based stroke registers are principal sources of stroke incidence estimates. This study aims to assess the concordance and correlation between GBD stroke incidence rates and stroke incidence rates from population-based stroke registers. Methods Crude and age-standardized stroke incidence rates were sourced from high quality population-based stroke registers and compared to GBD estimates matched by year and location, using GBD subnational data where available. Studies were categorized by country income group status using the World Bank country classifications; High income countries (HICs); Upper middle-income countries (UMICs) and Lower middle-income countries. Studies were categorized as to whether they were reported as informing the GBD 2021 model, using the online GBD 2021 sources tool. Concordance and correlation were assessed using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient and Pearson’s correlation coefficient respectively. Bland-Altman plots were created to display 95% limits of agreement. Findings 50 crude matched incidence rates and 31 matched age-standardized rates were compared. Concordance and correlation for crude stroke incidence were 0.67 and 0.68 overall, 0.66 and 0.68 for HICs, 0.59 and 0.77 for UMICs and 0.03 and 0.97 for LMICs respectively. Overall, 11 (22.0%) GBD estimates, accounting for UIs, matched population-based stroke register crude incidence rates. 95% limits of agreement were -110.2/100,00 to 134.1/100,000 overall. Concordance and correlation for age-standardized incidence rates were 0.56 and 0.59 overall, 0.59 and 0.63 for HICs, 0.12 and 0.17 for UMICs and 0.25 and 0.42 for LMICs. 95% limits of agreement were from -94.6 to 84.1/100,000. Subgroup analysis including only studies where more specific subnational geographical GBD estimates were available marginally improved crude incidence (n=18) concordance (0.67 to 0.71) but not age-standardized incidence (n=13) concordance (0.53 to 0.49). Subgroup analysis limited to population-based stroke registers included as GBD 2021 sources, did not significantly improve correlation or concordance. Interpretation Our findings demonstrate limited concordance and corelation in crude and age-standardized stroke incidence rates between population-based stroke registers and the GBD 2021 model, with lower concordance for UMICs and LMICs, compared to HICs. The wide 95% limits of agreement demonstrated should provide caution in the use of GBD stroke incidence estimates to guide policy or assess progress in the primary prevention of stroke.",

Using 100,000 product titles scraped from six national supermarket sites and labeled via a human-in-the-loop workflow, the CNN reaches a macro-F1 of 92.19 % with minimal computing cost, while the transformer attains 94.00 %, the first such result for Portuguese. Both models are published on Hugging Face, enabling reproducible inference at scale while the source data remain confidential.

    "Abstract": "Background and Research Aims: The Democratic Republic of Congo is among the leading timber exporters in Africa. Over the past two decades, human-driven deforestation has brought forest elephants Loxodonta cyclotis into closer contact with humans, leading to increased human-elephant conflicts. Understanding the attitudes of communities that predominantly depend on livestock farming and agriculture for their livelihoods is essential for designing effective conservation interventions. This study aims to assess those factors influencing farmers’ attitudes towards the presence of forest elephants in the Western part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Methods: We conducted interviews with a random sample of n = 45 farmers across five small villages in the Lukula territory. The effect of gender, age, education, and per capita income on the attitude towards the presence of forest elephants was analysed using a Bayesian ordinal regression mixed model to account for the small sample size. Farmers’ opinions regarding the most effective preventive measure/s to protect croplands were explored using Fisher’s exact test. Results: The results showed no significant effects of gender, age, or education in terms of attitudes towards the presence of forest elephants. In contrast, negative attitudes were significantly more prevalent among farmers with higher per capita incomes. Reforestation and beehive fences were most frequently quoted by farmers as effective methods of preventing human-elephant conflicts. Discussion: The perceived future losses due to elephant-related damages may drive more negative attitudes towards the presence of forest elephants. Notably, our study revealed that the species is still present in the Western transboundary area of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where, according to the farmers interviewed, it has never disappeared. Implications for Conservation: To enhance forest elephant conservation, it is essential to implement effective prevention measures, engage government authorities and local communities in conservation activities, and develop educational campaigns to foster human-elephant coexistence in shared landscapes.",

    "Abstract": "Background: High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) reduces dead-space ventilation, but this effect is diminished by open-mouth breathing and partial airway obstruction. Consequently, it is uncertain whether HFNC provides respiratory support during endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures. Methods: A single-center randomized controlled crossover study was conducted at the Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem, the Netherlands, from November 2022 to August 2024. Patients with severe COPD (Gold III/IV) were evaluated to determine if HFNC reduces dead space ventilation during an EBUS procedure. Exclusion criteria were known neurodegenerative conditions, allergies to propofol or esketamine, pregnancy, upper-airway obstructions, or severe pulmonary hypertension. Subjects received two sequences of HFNC flow (30 and 70 L/min or vice versa) during EBUS. The primary outcome was CO 2 washout, determined by a 60-s capnography trace with and without HFNC flow to measure the difference in inspiratory, end-tidal CO 2 , and β-angle. Results: Twenty subjects with severe COPD (Gold III/IV) were included (Group A n = 10; Group B n = 10), of which one could not complete the bronchial measurements because of an obstructing carcinoma. CO 2 washout at carina was observed at 70 L/min of HFNC flow, demonstrated by a reduced inspiratory CO 2 of mean 6.0 mm Hg (95% CI: 4.5–8.3, P &lt; .001) and end-tidal CO 2 of 5.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 2.3–7.5, P = .002), but not at 30 L/min of HFNC flow (mean inspiratory CO 2 difference of 1.5 mm Hg (95% CI: −2.3 to 6.0, P = .69) and mean end-tidal CO 2 difference of 0.8 mm Hg (95% CI: −2.3 to 3.0, P = .35). A flow of 70 L/min reduced inspiratory CO 2 in the left main bronchus (mean = 5.3 mm Hg; 95% CI: 2.3–8.3, P &lt; .001), but not the end-tidal CO 2 (mean = 3.0 mm Hg; 95% CI: 0.0–6.0, P = .07). Conclusions: An HFNC flow of 70 L/min reduced dead-space ventilation in subjects with severe COPD undergoing EBUS procedures during deep sedation, suggesting respiratory support during this procedure.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and disabling psychiatric condition in Saudi Arabia, with genetic susceptibility remaining incompletely characterized. Reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activity has been implicated in MDD. The Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265), involving the substitution of valine (Val, G allele) with methionine (Met, A allele), impairs activity-dependent BDNF secretion. This study examined the frequency of Val66Met and its association with MDD in a Saudi cohort. Materials and Methods: A case-control study was conducted, including 87 patients with MDD (44 males, 43 females; mean age 44.2 ± 11.5 years) and 87 healthy controls (39 males, 48 females; mean age 28.7 ± 8.4 years). Genotyping was performed using tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system–polymerase chain reaction. Unadjusted and age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression analyses were applied under genotype-specific, dominant, recessive, and allelic models. Results: The Val/Val (GG) genotype was more frequent in controls than patients (54.0% vs. 34.5%), whereas the Met/Met (AA) genotype was detected exclusively in patients (21.8% vs. 0%; χ 2 = 22.80, p = 1.1 × 10 −5 ). The Met (A) allele frequency was significantly higher in patients (43.7% vs. 23.0%; χ 2 = 15.84, p = 6.9 × 10 −5 ). Unadjusted analysis showed a protective effect of GG (OR = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.24–0.82) and a markedly increased risk associated with AA (OR = 49.81, 95% CI: 2.95–839.90). Dominant carriers (GA + AA) had increased odds of MDD (OR = 2.23), and each A allele conferred a higher risk (OR = 2.60). These associations remained significant after adjustment for age and sex. Conclusion: The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with MDD susceptibility in Saudis. The Met (A) allele, particularly in homozygosity, confers increased risk, while the Val/Val genotype appears protective, supporting population-specific genetic contributions to depression.",

    "Abstract": "Background: X-linked female-limited high myopia (MYP26, OMIM:301010) is a rare Mendelian subtype of early-onset high myopia (eoHM), with females having progressive myopic refractive error (≥−6 D) and males as asymptomatic carriers. Pathogenic variants in ARR3 (OMIM:301770) have been linked to eoHM, but the spectrum of ARR3 variants in Chinese populations remains incompletely defined. Objective: To identify the causative variant in a Chinese eoHM family and expand ARR3 variant spectrum for MYP26. Methods: We conducted clinical and genetic analyses of a Chinese family with eoHM. The proband underwent clinical examinations and whole-exome sequencing (WES). Sanger sequencing validated variants in affected family members, and bioinformatics tools evaluated variant pathogenicity. Results: WES identified an ARR3 c.214C&gt;T (p.R72X) stop-gain variant, co-segregating with the disease phenotype and predicted to truncate cone arrestin, disrupting phototransduction. A female carrier showing incomplete penetrance (I-1) was identified, which highlights the unrecognized complexity of the pathogenic mechanism underlying MYP26. This variant was first reported in the Chinese population. Conclusions: Our study expands the ARR3 variant spectrum associated with eoHM, highlighting the role of ARR3 c.214C&gt;T (p.R72X), first reported in Chinese populations. The finding of incomplete penetrance underscores the complexity of X-linked female-limited inheritance and provides a reference for genetic counseling of related families.",

    "Abstract": "Among berry fruits, strawberries are known for a wide array of beneficial biological activities, including antioxidant, antihypertensive, antibacterial, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and anti-metastatic effects. The cultivar Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne (Romina) is particularly rich in bioactive constituents that may contribute to limiting DNA damage triggered by reactive oxygen species. In this study, we examined whether the methanolic extract of Romina strawberries (RE) exerted any genotoxic effect on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) across concentrations ranging from 25 to 200 μg/mL using the comet assay. No evidence of genotoxicity was detected. Subsequently, the capacity of RE to counteract oxidative DNA damage in two experimental models was assesed. When PBMCs were pretreated with RE prior to hydrogen peroxide exposure, a slight reduction in DNA damage was observed, with only the 50 μg/mL concentration producing a statistically significant protective effect. To evaluate the extract's interventional capacity, cells were treated with RE following exposure to H 2 O 2 . In this post-treatment design, RE demonstrated a clearly stronger antigenotoxic response, reducing DNA damage at all tested concentrations, with the most pronounced effects at 100, 150, and 200 μg/mL. Overall, the methanolic extract of the Romina cultivar showed notable protective activity against H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative DNA damage in vitro .",

    "Abstract": "The article addresses the age-based biases embedded in artificial intelligence systems (AI ageism) from a sociotechnical perspective. Building on studies about digital ageism and research on the sociocultural imprint of generative AI, we interviewed five popular generative AI chatbots as communicative partners to expose and question potential ageist and sexist stereotypes (namely, those surrounding digital users) embedded in/reproduced by these systems, using sexism as a touchstone for comparison with ageism. Results show that the chatbots follow two double standards. The first concerns the “political correctness” to which they might have been socialized: the chatbots avoid (digital) sexism but not (digital) ageism, probably because of different levels of cultural sensitivity among designers, trainers, and users, or as a reproduction of biased training data. The second concerns the chatbots’ utilities: these are differently connoted depending on the AI users’ age and gender, demonstrating the interference of ageist and sexist stereotypes with how generative AI systems organize and reproduce information about human sociality.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Little is known about the barriers to care and resources needed for adolescents and young adults (AYAs, 15–39) with cancer in low- and middle-income countries, where most of these patients live. We aimed to address this gap through interviews with pediatric and adult hematologists/oncologists. Methods: We enrolled physicians from nine countries in Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Peru. Semistructured interviews were conducted in Spanish, recorded, transcribed, and translated into English. Results: Twenty-eight respondents provided over 26 hours of data, and 46% were adult hematologists/oncologists. We identified multiple barriers in caring for AYA patients, including clinical, psychosocial, financial, and educational barriers. These include a lack of a multidisciplinary team focused on AYA patients, mental health support, a dedicated space for this patient population, high treatment costs, travel distance to the hospital, and discontinuity of care due to age limits. In addition, there are competing demands for resources with adult oncology, delays in diagnosis, and patients’ abandonment of treatment. Potential opportunities for improvement included having multidisciplinary AYA oncology teams, standardized treatment protocols, AYA-specific cancer registry, dedicated space, mental health support (e.g., support groups), improving access to health insurance, patient and physician education, and vocational assistance. Conclusions: This study identifies substantial barriers to the care of AYA patients with cancer in Central America, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Peru. It also highlights key areas for potential intervention to improve outcomes in this population. These key findings can guide cancer control programs in Latin America as they begin to include AYAs.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Work ability and work-related outcomes (labor force participation, occupation, and educational attainment) are important for young adult-aged survivors of adolescent and young adult cancer (YAs). This study evaluates work-related outcomes and explores the role of workplace accommodations among YAs aged 25–34 years. Methods: For this cross-sectional study, YAs ( N = 209) completed measures of educational attainment, labor force participation, occupation, work ability, and workplace accommodations. Work ability was assessed using the Work Ability Index and Work Limitations Questionnaire productivity loss index. We compared work-related outcomes with national benchmarks; analysis of variance models examined associations among work ability, work-related outcomes, and workplace accommodations. Results: Participant education and employment were greater than national benchmarks. Among employed cancer survivors ( N = 176), individuals with less education reported lower work ability ( F = 3.99, p = 0.004) and greater productivity loss ( F = 4.21, p = 0.003) than those with higher levels of education. Workplace accommodations were a significant predictor of work ability; those with accommodations reported lower work ability ( F = 3.99, p = 0.004) and greater productivity loss ( F = 4.21, p = 0.003). Conclusions: While YAs in this sample generally demonstrated higher employment and educational attainment rates than the national average, those with lower educational levels face greater challenges in work ability. Workplace accommodations may only be provided to individuals experiencing the greatest deficits in work ability and productivity. This study highlights the need for additional data regarding workplace accommodations to enhance work ability and mitigate productivity loss among YAs.",

    "Abstract": "Studies focusing on brain imaging (EEG), neuromarketing, sports, and suspense and surprise have all been executed in limited combinations; however, no apparent studies combine all these aspects with sport media viewing. This study used EEG to measure brain activity stimulated by suspense and surprise in sports entertainment. Twenty-one subjects (mean age, 21.8 yr) viewed a stratified random selection of 8 out of 32 suspenseful and/or surprising sports video clips, 2 each of 4 categories: High Suspense and High Surprise (HH), High Suspense and Low Surprise (HL), Low Suspense and High Surprise (LH), and Low Suspense and Low Surprise (LL). EEG frequency bands (θ, α, β, and γ) and the α asymmetry index in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) were examined. Across video classifications, main effects were found for α activity in the Left-PFC and for PFC α asymmetry (F 3,60 = 5.298, p = 0.003). Further factorial analyses suggest that suspense and surprise have independent influences on brain activity and there were no apparent interactions between the factors. This provides evidence of the distinct effects that suspense and surprise, anticipatory versus outcome-driven emotions, have on a sports viewer’s brain and offers early insights into the impact of potentially modifiable elements of media for practitioners.",

    "Abstract": "Background Despite being raised in well-run institutions, orphans often face neglect and are at heightened risk for various psychological challenges. Objective This study investigates whether there are differences in emotional and behavioural problems based on the sociodemographic characteristics of adolescent orphans. Methods An exploratory study was conducted with 400 adolescent orphans in Kerala. Emotional and behavioural problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), and sociodemographic data were collected by a structured personal data schedule. Data were analysed using independent sample t -tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS 26. Results Significant differences in emotional and behavioural problems were observed based on gender, religion, type of orphan, duration of institutionalisation, and type of orphanage. Female orphans exhibited higher emotional problems. No significant differences were found with respect to age and domicile. Orphans residing in private orphanages showed lower conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer-related problems. Double and maternal orphans reported more emotional problems, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and peer problems than paternal orphans. Orphans belonging to the Muslim community exhibited lower behavioural problems and higher prosocial behaviour. Emotional problems were more pronounced among those institutionalised for less than a year. Conclusion The findings underscore the need for tailored psychosocial interventions that consider sociodemographic variations to improve the mental health outcomes of adolescent orphans.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Plasma cell dyscrasia (PCD) is a rare but important cause of end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Kidney transplant is the treatment of choice in patients with ESKD. However, the complexity of PCD care and risk of disease recurrence poses challenges to kidney transplant candidacy and outcomes. We examined the current clinical practice patterns of clinicians who care for patients with PCD and identified barriers to kidney transplantation for patients with PCD. Methods: A web-based survey was developed and distributed from January to July 2024 to kidney transplant clinicians (American Society of Transplant (AST) members), hematologists (PCD experts), and onco-nephrologists. Results: Seventy clinicians (50 transplant nephrologists, 18 hematologists, and two surgeons) from 42 transplant centers in the US participated in the survey. Clinical practice patterns pre and post kidney transplant for patients with PCD are highly variable among institutions, and only 36% reported having a protocol for pre- and post-transplant management for patients with PCD. Particularly, the requirement for pre-transplant hematologic remission criteria, induction and maintenance immunosuppression regimens and protocols for prophylaxis and screening for opportunistic infection are areas of future study. Clinicians listed lack of data and practice guidance as well as communication challenges among multiple specialties especially hematology and kidney transplant clinicians as notable barriers. Conclusions: Our study identified the highly variable current practice patterns when evaluating and managing patients with PCD for kidney transplant. Our findings emphasize the need for collecting and sharing clinical data to support standardized practices and serve as a basis for the upcoming multi-societal management recommendation for kidney transplant for patients with PCD.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: WHO defines infertility as the ‘failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse’. Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) includes disorders centered on sexual desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain, which impair quality of life. Sexual Dysfunction impacts infertility as it results in decreased coital frequency, which can worsen infertility, adding to the distress of patients. The current study was a modest attempt to help detect and raise awareness about sexual dysfunction in patients and treating doctors, so that the necessary intervention can be provided, which ultimately improves treatment outcome and quality of life. Methods: This is a hospital-based, observational study. A total of 120 women between ages of 18 and 45 years attending the OPD Infertility clinic, at a tertiary care hospital over a period of 6 months from January 2024 to July 2024 were chosen for the study. Patients with current psychiatric illness, chronic debilitating medical illness, not engaging in sexual intercourse in the last 1 month or sexual dysfunction in a partner were excluded from the research. Results: The findings reveal that sexual dysfunction is prevalent among women facing infertility, with a slightly higher incidence in secondary infertility cases. Secondary infertile women had statistically significantly lower scores in arousal, orgasm and satisfaction domains than those with primary infertility. Conclusion: The high prevalence of sexual dysfunction both in primary and secondary infertility underscore the importance of incorporating sexual health assessments and psychosexual counseling into infertility treatment. Adopting a holistic approach, including psychological and relational dimensions of infertility care can improve both individual and couple outcomes and potentially fostering better sexual health.",

    "Abstract": "Wars have multiple complex effects on population health. Countries suffer extensively from disruptions to their societies, economies, and environment. Understanding the pathways of disruption helps to adapt and mitigate the catastrophic effects of war. We used a previously published 12-dimensional framework on the health impacts of war to derive pathways of influence under three phases. The first phase, before overt aggression, includes economic sanctions, trade wars, and embargoes, often combined with covert military action and disrupted supply chains, infrastructure, and health services. The second phase of overt aggression has multiple direct and indirect effects on health: ( a ) morbidity and mortality; ( b ) population displacements with psychosocial implications; ( c ) opportunity costs from military expenditures often reversing economic growth and widening inequalities; ( d ) environmental degradation; ( e ) air and soil pollution from explosives; ( f ) destroyed infrastructure include housing, basic amenities, and health infrastructure; ( g ) destroyed arable land, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity; ( h ) and contamination of water sources. The third phase occurs during peace negotiations and when peace appears and consists of long-term effects. The latter includes transgenerational impacts on human well-being. Considering the wide health, social, and environmental implications of wars lasting for generations, we reiterate the call for an “end to all wars.”",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Cognitive flexibility is essential for behavioral adaptation in response to environmental changes and is impaired in various neuropsychiatric disorders. The serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin has shown potential in enhancing cognitive flexibility, although with mixed results. In this study, we investigated the effects of psilocybin on cognitive flexibility in rats using a three-choice visual reversal learning task. Methods: Sixteen Long-Evans rats were trained on a three-choice touchscreen-based reversal learning task. Following training and initial reversal testing, psilocybin (1 mg/kg, subcutaneous) or saline was administered in a crossover design. Behavioral performance was assessed through recording the time to achieve learning criteria, reaction times, and interaction patterns with image choices, focusing on short-term effects (days after administration during the crossover interventions) and trends over subsequent reversals (weeks). Using computational reinforcement learning models, we analyzed development in latent cognitive parameters, such as learning rate and value sensitivity. Results: Five rats successfully completed all six reversal learning protocols, demonstrating significant learning and unlearning dynamics. The number of sessions to attain learning criteria and the reaction time for the touchscreen decreased significantly across protocols. Psilocybin administration impaired the rate of learning and unlearning across sessions during the first postdrug reversal. Computational modeling identified low learning rates, with no significant differences between psilocybin and placebo conditions on any parameters. However, exploratory analysis revealed enhanced rates of learning and unlearning over the session in the second postdrug reversal compared with baseline. Conclusions: Only a subset (31%) of rats effectively engaged in this complex three-choice visual reversal learning task, thereby demonstrating learning and unlearning over time. Psilocybin impaired short-term performance in learning and unlearning speeds, whereas exploratory findings suggested possible long-term enhancements in learning dynamics. Results show a nuanced effect of psilocybin on cognitive flexibility, with potential relevance for its interventional use in neuropsychiatric disorders. Further research should explore long-term outcomes and refine computational models for complex tasks.",

    "Abstract": "Special purpose vehicles (SPVs) are a form of project organization created for public–private partnership (PPP) projects. SPVs are complex organizational arrangements, relating actors from different institutionally regulative, normative, and cognitive contexts. We abductively analyze interviews with 36 practitioners experienced in managing SPVs using Gioia analysis. We find that SPV design is focused on systems integration, framed by transactional interpretations of contracts. This undercuts the interorganizational integration necessary for SPV design to work more effectively. We find that social and interorganizational integration remain largely overlooked, which is a key reason for PPP infrastructure project failure.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Soil salinity threatens global agriculture by impairing plant growth, crop productivity, and soil health. This study was conducted to assess the impact of salinity on chickpea performance at the vegetative stage and the possible ameliorating role of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and proline applications. A greenhouse experiment with 30 pots (5 replicates × 6 treatments) subjected half the treatments to 200 mM NaCl, AMF was applied at sowing, and proline was sprayed two weeks post-planting. Total pigments dramatically decreased [49.18%] in salt-stressed chickpea. Biomass, protein and carbohydrate metabolism were also affected. For instance, plant height and total fresh weight (TFW) showed inhibitions of 37.83% and 72.19% as compared to control. Conversely, chickpea under salt stress had an increased accumulation of H 2 O 2 (13.12 mg/g DW) and higher electrolyte leakage (54.72%), however, proline or AMF supplementation decreased their levels. Also, the total protein content and antioxidant enzymes were higher in salt-stressed treatments. Under stress, the total carbohydrate contents in chickpea leaves were significantly enhanced by AMF inoculation (23.44%) and proline application (19.43%), when compared to the control. Moreover, salinity led to distortion of chickpea leaf anatomy including a decrease in upper and lower epidermis thickness, vessel numbers, as well as degradation of palisade and spongy parenchyma. Salinity also disrupted ion balance, increasing Na + and decreasing K + (lower K + /Na + ratio), which elevated H 2 O 2 levels and membrane leakage. These results revealed that AMF as a symbiotic microorganism and proline as a well-known osmoprotectant perform several tasks to alleviate NaCl stress by decreasing Na + uptake, H 2 O 2 content and membrane leakage. Subsequently, an enhancement in growth criteria, pigment fraction and carbohydrates was achieved with their applications under NaCl stress. Most obviously their applications maintained the chickpea leaf anatomy. As an innovative approach, we propose that AMF inoculation or proline application can reverse salinity-induced damage, offering a pathway to enhance crop tolerance in salt-affected regions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The prevalence of obesity in Hungary ranks among the highest in the European Union, representing a significant healthcare burden. In modern medicine, stroke remains one of the major cardiovascular cost drivers, with obesity being a key modifiable risk factor. Aims To estimate annual stroke-related healthcare cost savings achievable through population-level reduction in body mass index (BMI) in Hungary, based on five international risk models. Methods A cross-sectional study of 2,442 adults was conducted between June and August 2022 via the nationwide “Bringing Screening to You” program. Post-stratification weighting by sex and age was applied to align with the 2022 national census. Population-attributable fraction (PAF) analysis incorporated five published BMI–stroke models (HUNT, CHARLS-male cohort, Physicians’ Health Study, meta-analysis, INTERSTROKE) and was applied to the €1.016 billion national stroke cost for 2022. Uncertainty was assessed using a 10,000-iteration Monte Carlo simulation. Results Weighted overweight and obesity prevalence was 72.5% (95% CI: 70.6–74.4%), one of the highest observed among Central and Eastern European countries. The PAF of stroke cases associated with excess BMI ranged from 9.7% to 20.4%, corresponding to annual cost savings of €99–207 million under a theoretical maximum scenario of complete BMI normalization, assuming proportional cost reduction. Conservative estimates (HUNT model) projected €99 million in savings (95% CI: 75–127), while higher estimates (Physicians’ Health Study) yielded €207 million (95% CI: 145–265). Conclusions Population-level BMI reduction could reduce Hungary’s annual stroke related healthcare expenditure by at least €99 million, representing substantial potential savings. These findings support implementation of population-level comprehensive obesity prevention strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background This prospective interventional study assessed adolescents’ baseline knowledge of the 12 European Code Against Cancer (ECAC) recommendations and evaluated the impact of a school-based multimedia enhanced intervention on knowledge improvement and retention. Methods The intervention comprised six 45-min multimedia lessons promoting knowledge of all 12 ECAC recommendations in German secondary schools. Materials were developed and refined by an interdisciplinary expert panel and underwent pilot testing before implementation. An anonymous single-recall-based, open-ended questionnaire assessed baseline knowledge (t0) and mean knowledge gains immediately post-intervention (t1) and at three months follow-up (t2). Descriptive statistics were computed, with quantitative variables summarized by mean and standard deviation, and qualitative variables by absolute and relative frequencies. Results A total of 923 pupils participated (51.8% female; 39.0% male; 9.2% diverse/undeclared), with 923 completing baseline (t0), 873 post-intervention (t1), and 779 the follow-up assessments (t2). Notable knowledge gaps regarding the ECAC were present at baseline. Mean (M) knowledge scores increased significantly across all three assessment time points with post-intervention scores (t1, M = 7.63 (Standard deviation (SD) = 2.67); p &lt; 0.0001) significantly higher than at baseline (t0, M = 4.11 (SD = 1.84)). Largest average improvements post intervention (t0-t1) were observed for breastfeeding importance (+ 50%; 1.20% (t0), 51.2% (t1), p &lt; 0.001), vaccination participation (+ 49.6%; 13.9% (t0), 63.5%(t1), p &lt; 0.001) and regular physical activity (+ 39.4%, p &lt; 0.001).The most sustainable recommendation improvements [calculated by (t2-t0)/(t1-t0)] were observed for alcohol abstinence (0.76); healthy dietary pattern (0.72), and physical activity (0.69) respectively. Conclusions: Multimedia enhanced school-based interventions incorporating the ECAC recommendations effectively increase cancer prevention knowledge among adolescents and knowledge retention after three months. While knowledge retention trends indicated a need for reinforcement, our results demonstrate the effectiveness of early, targeted interventions to address baseline knowledge gaps and provide insights that could potentially shape future interventions.

A 67-year-old male patient, afflicted with recurrent right otalgia for over 50 years and misdiagnosed with otitis and trigeminal neuralgia, demonstrated posterior circulation hypoperfusion on cerebral CT perfusion imaging. Conventional vascular tests turned up nothing, yet dynamic contrast-enhanced CT (DCE-CT) disclosed a long-segment CVAD with endothelial flaps within the intracranial vertebral artery, precisely matching the hypoperfused territory. Post endovascular stent repair of the CVAD, the hypoperfusion normalized and the otalgia vanished. At 29 months, the patient remained pain - free without analgesics.This case highlights that CVAD-related posterior circulation hypoperfusion is a critical contributor to cryptogenic intractable otalgia. The evidence supports the efficacy of endovascular therapy as a promising intervention.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Ethical safeguards are critical in HIV research involving minors, especially vulnerable groups such as men who have sex with men (MSM) under 18 years. This systematic review explores how informed assent and consent practices are reported, guided by the 2016 Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) guidelines. Methods A systematic review was conducted of peer-reviewed studies from 2010 to 2023 involving MSM under 18 years, using PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases. Key ethical components were extracted and synthesized thematically. Results Of 410 articles screened, 65 met inclusion criteria. All included studies reported informed consent, but only 20% ( n = 13) included informed assent. Most were conducted in high-income countries (64%), with no representation from low-income settings. Only 7% involved minors living with HIV. Quantitative methods were predominant (82%), and 20% used online platforms. Waivers of parental permission were reported in 27% of studies, while only 3% obtained parental permission. Four studies described tailored consent/assent approaches, such as simplified language, comprehension checks, and involvement of minor advocates. Conclusion This review highlights inconsistencies in how informed assent is addressed in HIV research involving MSM minors. Only one in five studies described ethically appropriate, youth-tailored processes. Limited use of waivers and adapted assent procedures points to ongoing gaps in aligning research with ethical standards. Future studies should adopt clearer, age-appropriate consent practices, ensure transparent reporting, and strengthen researcher training in ethics involving vulnerable minors.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The Caenorhabditis elegans–Escherichia coli system is advantageous for studying host-microbe interactions at the single-gene level. By screening with this system, we identified that the deletion of cpxR , an E. coli transcription factor for the envelope stress response, delays C. elegans development. This finding led us to investigate how this gene regulates host development. Results We identified that E. coli Δ cpxR induced C. elegans developmental delay and activated the C. elegans mitochondrial unfolded protein response pathway through reactive oxygen species. It is widely accepted that the Cpx system is important for bacterial pathogenesis, and activating CpxR is regarded as an antimicrobial strategy. Moreover, we discovered that Δ cpxR cultured in LB medium, not cultured in M9 minimal medium, delayed C. elegans development, and the L-histidine-related metabolism of Δ cpxR contributed mostly to the difference. The metabolic fluctuations of commensal bacteria reveal that, rather than the activation of the E. coli Cpx response, the dynamic response of the E. coli Cpx system really contributes to C. elegans development. Furthermore, as the concentration of N -acetylcysteine increased, the phenotype of C. elegans fed Δ cpxR transitioned from developmental delay to survival resistance. The dynamic response is also indicated in the process in which commensal E. coli improves the stress tolerance of the host C. elegans to N -acetylcysteine. Conclusions Our results illustrate that environmental factors can shape the regulation of the E. coli Cpx response to C. elegans , providing new evidence for why Cpx-mediated virulence phenotypes are inconsistent among gram-negative species in different ecological niches.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Drosophila melanogaster has been a valuable model for dissecting the molecular architecture of innate immunity. However, the family Drosophilidae encompasses over 4000 species, spanning deep evolutionary divergences and diverse ecologies. Here, we use immune challenge with the Gram-negative pathogen Providencia rettgeri to investigate the conservation and evolution of immune responses in three non-model drosophilid species that diverged from D. melanogaster over 45 million years ago— Hirtodrosophila cameraria , H. confusa , and Scaptodrosophila deflexa . Results We find that all three species retain a core set of immune signaling and recognition genes, but exhibit substantial variation in effector gene content and inducibility. In particular, Scaptodrosophila deflexa lacks orthologs of multiple antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) known from D. melanogaster , including DptA , AttA , and AttC , and shows little transcriptional response to bacterial challenge with Providencia rettgeri . In contrast, both of the Hirtodrosophila species exhibit substantial transcriptional responses, including strong induction of canonical Imd pathway genes. Microbiome profiling of our samples revealed higher Providencia abundance in H. cameraria , and high levels of the defensive symbiont Spiroplasma in S. deflexa —potentially explaining differences in infection outcome. Our combined annotation and expression analysis of these species also allowed us to identify 20 novel AMP-like candidates, many with structural features like known AMPs. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the feasibility of functional immune analyses in non-model Drosophila species and reveals striking lineage-specific differences in immune gene repertoire and expression. These findings highlight the importance of non-model, wild-derived samples for uncovering novel immune effectors and understanding evolutionary forces shaping insect immunity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The growing and pervasive use of social network sites (SNS) has raised concerns about their impact on adolescent mental health during this sensitive developmental phase. Existing longitudinal studies are constrained by methodological limitations and limited exploration of underlying mechanisms. We investigated the longitudinal associations between SNS use and depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescents and whether sleep mediated these associations. Methods We analysed longitudinal data from 2350 adolescents from 31 schools in London, participating in the Study of Cognition, Adolescents, and Mobile Phones (SCAMP). The exposure was self-reported duration of SNS use at baseline (aged 11–12 years). Outcomes were depressive and anxiety symptoms at follow-up, analysed as symptom severity and clinically significant symptoms (aged 13–15 years). The associations between SNS use and depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed via multi-level ordinal logistic regression (symptom severity) and logistic regression (clinically significant symptoms). The mediation effects of insufficient sleep, sleep onset latency, and sleep disturbance were assessed by mediation analysis. Results Compared to 0–30 min per day, more than 3 h per day of SNS use at baseline was associated with higher severity levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.47, 95% CI 1.12, 1.93 and OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.06, 1.83, respectively) and clinically significant depressive and anxiety symptoms at follow-up (OR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.19, 2.42 and OR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.11, 2.31, respectively). The associations between total and weekend SNS use and depressive symptom severity were stronger in girls than boys. Other associations were similar by gender. Insufficient sleep duration (particularly on weekdays) and sleep onset latency at baseline partly mediated the associations of SNS use and depressive and anxiety symptoms (proportion of mediation ranged between 11.1% and 33.1%). The mediation effects of sleep disturbance were less marked. Conclusions In a large longitudinal cohort, we found that SNS use exceeding 3 h per day is associated with increased risks of depressive and anxiety symptoms in adolescents. Findings from mediation analysis suggest that addressing poor sleep hygiene in relation to SNS use might mitigate the negative impact of high SNS use. Our findings may inform the development of early secondary school curricula incorporating digital literacy and sleep hygiene education.",

We aimed to evaluate the associations and predictive value of combining echocardiography with inflammatory biomarkers for mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Methods In a prospective cohort of individuals with type 1 diabetes without known cardiovascular disease, we evaluated whether subclinical left ventricular dysfunction, defined by an elevated ratio of early mitral inflow velocity to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e′) or impaired global longitudinal strain (GLS), combined with elevated levels of an inflammatory biomarker (interleukin-6 [IL-6], soluble urokinase-plasminogen-activator-receptor [suPAR], or high-sensitivity C-reactive-protein [hsCRP]), was associated with all-cause mortality and MACE. Cox models were adjusted for all 10 variables included in the Steno T1 Risk Engine variables: age, sex, systolic blood pressure, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, low-density lipoprotein, estimated glomerular filtration rate, albuminuria status, smoking, and physical activity. C-statistics and net reclassification improvement were assessed. Results Among 876 participants (51% male, median age 50 years), 114 deaths occurred over 14.5 years of follow-up. Elevated E/e’ combined with IL-6 or suPAR, but not hsCRP, was independently associated with mortality. Compared with individuals with E/e’ &lt;8 and non-elevated IL-6, the hazard ratio (HR) for E/e’ 8–13 with elevated IL-6 was 2.5 (95% CI 1.4 to 4.6, P &lt; 0.01), and for E/e′ ≥13 with elevated IL-6 was 3.4 (1.5–7.6; P &lt; 0.01). Corresponding HRs for suPAR were 2.4 (1.2 to 4.7, P &lt; 0.01) and 3.9 (1.8 to 8.5, P &lt; 0.01). Adding E/e′ and an inflammatory biomarker increased the C-statistic from 0.839 (Steno T1 Risk Engine alone) to 0.887 (E/e’ and IL6) and 0.868 (E/e’ and suPAR). Findings were similar for GLS and with MACE as the outcome. Conclusions Echocardiography combined with inflammatory biomarkers synergistically identifies individuals with type 1 diabetes, without known cardiovascular disease, who are at high risk of mortality and MACE.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) remains a widely embraced therapeutic modality for primary liver cancer. The present study sought to explore the prevalence of psychological crisis in patients with primary liver cancer following TACE and pinpoint its associated factors, to provide actionable implications for enhancing clinical treatment and care protocols. Methods A cross-sectional study design was utilized. Eligible participants were patients diagnosed with primary liver cancer who had undergone TACE and admitted to our hospital during the period from January 2023 to March 2025. The Triage Assessment Form (TAF) was adopted to assess the psychological crisis status of all enrolled patients. Results A total of 276 primary liver cancer patients who had received TACE were included in the final analysis. The mean total score of psychological crisis among these patients was 18.25 ± 3.17. Spearman rank correlation analysis revealed significant associations between psychological crisis scores and age, gender, marital status, educational level, and average monthly household income (all p &lt; 0.05). Multivariate linear regression analysis, adjusted for clinical covariates (Child-Pugh class, BCLC stage, TACE session frequency, post-procedural pain, and complications), confirmed the above five sociodemographic factors as independent correlates of psychological crisis scores (all p &lt; 0.05). Collectively, these factors explained 56.2% of the variance in the outcome variable, with no statistically significant associations observed between psychological crisis scores and the included clinical variables (all p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion Patients with primary liver cancer following TACE exhibit moderate acute post-procedural psychological crisis-like states, which are primarily associated with sociodemographic vulnerability factors rather than objective clinical indicators. Targeted psychological screening and brief interventions for high-risk groups (younger patients, females, unmarried/divorced individuals, those with lower educational attainment, and lower household income) are critical to mitigate the adverse impacts of acute psychological distress on perioperative TACE care.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Cancer metastasis is the leading cause of mortality associated with cancer, and the prognosis for patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer(CRC) largely depends on the occurrence of metastasis during the progression of the disease. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying metastasis in CRC is essential for advancing treatment strategies. Through integrated bioinformatics analysis of mRNA expression profiles and epigenetic modifiers, we identified SMYD3 as the top differentially expressed histone modifier in CRC. Clinically, SMYD3 overexpression significantly associates with poor prognosis and enhances metastatic potential. Utilizing immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry, we discovered RACK1 as a novel SMYD3-interacting protein. Subsequent mechanistic studies revealed a tripartite interaction network: SMYD3 recruits SMAD3 through RACK1-mediated scaffolding, facilitating transcriptional activation of the downstream effector TSKU. Notably, RACK1 depletion disrupts SMYD3-SMAD3 complex formation, establishing the critical role of this axis in metastasis regulation. Consequently, inhibiting the SMYD3-SMAD3 interaction may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for addressing CRC metastasis. In conclusion, targeting the SMYD3-RACK1-SMAD3 transcriptional complex presents a viable approach for the treatment of CRC metastasis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of skin staplers for wound closure following extended L-shaped incisions in the treatment of calcaneal fractures. Methods A randomized controlled trial was performed on 82 calcaneal fracture cases (Sanders types III-IV) that underwent extended L-shaped incisions at the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University from June 2022 to March 2025. Out of these, 60 cases met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A non-blinded, open, randomized controlled trial was conducted, assigning patients to either the stapler group ( n = 28) or the Allgower-Donati group ( n = 32). The key parameters assessed included wound closure time, the area of postoperative inflammatory reaction, changes in skin temperature at the incision corners, and wound healing grades. These parameters were then compared between the two groups. Results At the 2-week postoperative follow-up, when sutures were removed, no significant differences were found in terms of inflammatory reaction area, skin temperature changes, or wound healing grades between the two groups. However, the stapler group demonstrated a notably shorter wound closure time (10.89 ± 2.87 min) compared to the Allgower-Donati group (20.44 ± 2.01 min). Conclusion The use of skin staplers for wound closure resulted in healing outcomes that showed no statistically significant differences from those achieved with the Allgower-Donati suturing technique in extended L-shaped incisions for calcaneal fractures. Importantly, the skin stapler method significantly reduces wound closure time ( P &lt; 0.05), which can lead to shorter overall surgical durations and a decreased risk of wound infections.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Despite being widely used to treat cardiovascular disease (CVD), there are still limitations of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for their widespread use due to undetermined pharmacological mechanisms. The emerging area of “pharmacomicrobiology” facilitates the pursuing of the complex interactions between TCM and gut microbiome as the gut microbiota influences TCM bioavailability and efficacy, vice versa TCM affects the microbial composition and function. Furthermore, research over the past decades has proved that gut dysbiosis and diverse microbial metabolites intimately related to the onset and progression of CVD. Herein, we summarize latest understanding of the TCM–gut–heart axis in CVD, with an emphasis on describing microbial changes and the associated mechanisms in CVD, elaborating the role of gut microbiota in metabolizing TCM, and how TCM can be used to treat CVD through affecting the gut microbiota. We further highlight the challenges and future directions that target TCM–gut–heart axis in prospects for personalized medicine in CVD, thus to present novel insights for developing new therapeutic approaches.

    "Abstract": "Abstract The rapid increase in municipal solid waste (MSW) generation across urban centers in Pakistan, combined with insufficient waste management infrastructure, presents a significant environmental and public health challenge. This study assesses methane emissions and leachate generation from major MSW dumpsites in Rawalpindi and Lahore, two of Punjab province’s largest cities. Emissions were estimated and projected over a 50-year active timespan using the U.S. EPA LandGEM model following IPCC 2006 guidelines. Cumulative emissions from Lahore’s solid waste disposal (SWD) systems were calculated at approximately 133,446 Gg, equivalent to 108 Mt CO₂-eq, with contributions comprising 26% methane, 73% carbon dioxide (CO₂), and 0.2% non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs). In contrast, Rawalpindi’s SWD systems generated 958 Gg (or 7.8 Mt CO₂-eq) over their operational life, exhibiting a similar emissions profile. Two unmanaged Lahore sites—LD2 (1643 Gg CH₄) and MB1 (1383.9 Gg CH₄)—emerged as the most significant methane emitters across both cities. These results underscore the urgent need for targeted waste management strategies, particularly the deployment of methane capture technologies and effective leachate treatment systems. The study highlights the substantial greenhouse gas emissions and groundwater contamination risks posed by unmanaged landfills. To mitigate these impacts and align with national climate goals, the adoption of site-specific policies and sustainable waste-to-energy solutions is imperative.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype lacking targeted therapeutic options, where platinum-based chemotherapy such as carboplatin serves as a cornerstone of treatment. Despite initial responses, the rapid emergence of acquired resistance remains a major clinical barrier. Understanding the molecular adaptations that drive platinum resistance is essential to develop strategies to restore sensitivity and identify alternative vulnerabilities. Methods We generated four isogenic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) pairs (WHIM30, BCM‑2147, BCM‑3887, BCM‑7482) through serial carboplatin exposure to model acquired resistance in TNBC. Bulk RNA sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and histopathological analyses were performed to define transcriptomic and phenotypic changes associated with resistance. Synergistic therapeutic combinations were identified using high-throughput drug screening in carboplatin-resistant (CR) PDX-derived models, followed by in vivo validation in NSG mice. Tumor growth and survival were assessed using mixed-effects modeling, two-way ANOVA, and Welch’s student t-test. Results The resulting isogenic PDX pairs captured both convergent and model-specific adaptations to carboplatin. CR tumors demonstrated heterogeneous activation of DNA damage repair pathways, including restoration of BRCA1-dependent homologous recombination (BCM‑2147, WHIM30) and compensatory upregulation of mismatch repair (BCM‑3887). In the BRCA1-mutant BCM‑7482 model, resistance correlated with HORMAD1 upregulation, suggesting an alternative HRD-associated mechanism. Morphologically, BCM‑7482CR tumors exhibited a significant increase in nuclear size compared to their sensitive counterpart ( p &lt; 0.0001). Drug screening identified mTOR pathway inhibition as a recurrent vulnerability across CR models. Sacituzumab govitecan (SG) combined with Everolimus produced robust synergy in vitro and superior tumor control in vivo compared to single agents in both WHIM30CR and BCM‑2147CR. A second combination, Everolimus + Selinexor (KPT‑330), also reduced tumor burden, achieving statistical significance in an expanded WHIM30CR cohort and suppressing metastatic progression in the intrinsically resistant WHIM2 model. Conclusions Isogenic PDX models of TNBC provide a powerful platform to define molecular mechanisms of acquired carboplatin resistance and uncover actionable therapeutic strategies. Our findings reveal multiple adaptive routes to platinum resistance, including restoration of homologous recombination and activation of alternative DNA repair programs. Synergistic interactions between SG and mTOR inhibition offer a promising avenue for overcoming resistance, supporting further clinical investigation of these combinations in TNBC.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The KRAS G12C mutation is one of the special mutation types in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM). Although several small molecule inhibitors specifically targeting KRAS G12C mutation have been developed, they have only shown limited clinical benefits for CRLM patients. Thus, alternative approaches are still needed. Methods We screened out the differentially expressed gene Aldo–keto reductase family 1 member B10 (AKR1B10) between the KRAS G12C mutation and wild-type CRLM through RNA sequencing, and characterized the tumor microenvironment (TME) changes of the KRAS G12C mutation CRLM using multi-omics analysis. The role of AKR1B10 in the TME and its progression of KRAS G12C mutation CRLM was confirmed by in vitro and in vivo experiments, and the molecular mechanism of lactate on neutrophils reprogramming was detected by immunofluorescence, western blot and Chip-qPCR. Results AKR1B10 was highly expressed in the KRAS G12C mutation CRLM and was associated with a poor prognosis. Mechanistically, AKR1B10 promotes the recruitment of neutrophils in the TME by CXCL8/CXCR2 pathway. Meanwhile, AKR1B10 could promote the production of lactate by regulating crucial glycolytic enzymes. The increased lactate accumulation in the TME promoted histone lactylation of neutrophils, which induced PD-L1 transcription and prompted the reprogramming of neutrophils to an immunosuppressive phenotype. Conclusion AKR1B10 facilitated immune evasion of KRAS G12C mutation CRLM by recruiting and reprogramming neutrophils to remodel the immunosuppressive TME, providing a potential therapeutic target for KRAS G12C mutation CRLM patients.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Identification of stroke during an emergency call remains challenging. We aimed to explore performed stroke examination with prehospital live video transmission during an emergency call from a bystander’s smartphone to the medical dispatcher. Methods Since 2019, the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) in Copenhagen, consisting of the Emergency Medical Coordination Centre (EMCC) and the Out-of-Hours Health Service (OOHS), have enabled medical dispatchers to add live video to emergency calls. Dispatchers are registered nurses or paramedics. Live video is initiated via text message link sent to the caller’s smartphone. We included all cases where the dispatcher added live video to the emergency call and stroke was suspected or later identified according to the Danish Stroke Registry. The video-recorded on-site stroke examinations were retrospectively analyzed. No specific guidance for video-based stroke examination was in place. Results A successful live video transmission was achieved in 550 potential stroke cases, where 52% were correctly examined for facial paresis and 16% for both facial and extremities paresis. In six patients, hemiparesis was observed without an examination. The group with ‘considered stroke’ had the highest amount of examined cases. Dispatchers suspected stroke in 450 cases, and stroke was confirmed in 16% ( n = 73). Stroke was diagnosed in 126 cases and was not suspected in 46% of these cases (missed stroke n = 63, TIA n = 10). Patients with missed stroke had significantly less accurate examinations and more often hemorrhagic stroke, compared to patients with confirmed stroke. Conclusion Video is not routinely used for stroke assessment during emergency calls, and only a small number of cases are sufficiently examined for stroke with video. Implementation of a structured protocol for live video guided stroke examinations during emergency calls could be beneficial but best practice is still unknown.",

Chronic care model (CCM) has been proved successful in Hong Kong primary care setting. This study aims to assess the clinical effectiveness of a CCM, named Assessment and Management Program on Knee Osteoarthritis (RAMP-Knee OA), compared to usual care in adults with knee OA. Methods The study is a 52-week, two-arm, parallel, open-label randomized clinical trial, evaluating the clinical efficacy of RAMP-Knee OA ( N = 114) versus usual care ( N = 114) on self-reported knee pain and other secondary outcomes. Measurement instruments will be tested at baseline, 16, 32, and 52 weeks. The primary outcome will be the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC; 5-point Likert) pain at 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes include a set of biopsychosocial parameters: Physical function will be measured subjectively by WOMAC function subscale and objectively by the 30-second chair and stand performance test. Lower limb muscle mass will be measured by bioimpedance analysis. Physical activity level will be measured by the Chinese International Physical Activity Questionnaire (Short form). Self-management efficacy will be measured by Pain-Self Efficacy questionnaire. Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) will be used to measure anxiety and depression, respectively. Insomnia will be measured by the 7-item Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and loneliness will be measured by the 6-item De Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. EuroQuol-5D questionnaire will be used to measure health-related quality of life. Both primary and secondary outcomes at different points will be conducted using analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline values. Secondary analyses include adjustments for potential confounders and exploration of interaction effects of treatment and the potential moderators.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) represents a common comorbidity with AUD which worsens outcomes and decreases functional outcomes. Suvorexant (SUV) shows clear promise as a novel therapeutic candidate to treat AUD and PTSD. Methods This study features a promising compound (i.e., suvorexant), the application of a well-established human laboratory paradigm (i.e., alcohol cue reactivity), and a novel early efficacy laboratory model (i.e., practice quit attempt) to provide a cost/time-efficient evaluation of safety and initial efficacy of suvorexant for AUD with comorbid PTSD. Additionally, by collecting both objective and subjective sleep measures, the study provides an assessment of a putative mechanism through which suvorexant jointly addresses an intervening variable common to both AUD and PTSD. Discussion The combination of human laboratory modeling and real-world clinical outcomes provides a unique and synergistic set of data that can advance the development of suvorexant and identify its behavioral mechanisms of action. The recruitment of individuals with AUD and PTSD with sleep disturbances and who are intrinsically motivated to quit is a novel approach to screening pharmacotherapies by bridging the gap between experimental studies with non-treatment seekers and clinical trials with treatment-seeking individuals.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Advanced Trauma Life Support® (ATLS®) is the most widely adopted form of trauma life support training worldwide, but there is no high-quality evidence that it can improve patient outcomes. The aim of this trial is to compare the effects of ATLS® training with standard care on outcomes in adult trauma patients. Methods ADVANCE TRAUMA is a batched stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial in India, where ATLS® is not routinely implemented. The trial will be conducted in 30 clusters (hospitals), organised into six batches of five clusters each. All clusters transition through three phases: first, a standard care phase; second, a 1-month transition phase, during which the training is delivered; and finally, an intervention phase, for a total of 13 months. Each cluster is randomised to an implementation sequence that defines the duration of the standard care and intervention phases. The trial will include at least 4320 adult trauma patients (≥ 15 years) who present to emergency departments and are subsequently admitted or transferred for admission. The primary outcome is in-hospital mortality within 30 days of arrival at the emergency department. Discussion This will be the first large-scale trial to provide robust evidence of the effectiveness of ATLS® since the programme was initiated in 1978. Regardless of the findings, this study will have important implications for trauma life support training globally. If ATLS® training improves patient outcomes, ways to promote its use and optimise its implementation, especially in low- and middle-income countries such as India, should be explored. If patient outcomes do not improve, trauma life support training must change.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Anaerobic microbes produce multienzyme complexes known as cellulosomes to enhance the degradation of cellulosic substrates. These complexes localize diverse enzymes onto a protein scaffold, where proteins are anchored by dockerin domains. Although the cellulosomes of anaerobic fungi incorporate a broad array of cellulolytic enzymes, they remain largely unexplored. Notably, some fungal cellulosomes reportedly comprise expansin-like proteins with potential to disrupt cellulose networks. While two bacterial cellulosomal expansin-like proteins have been characterized, no fungal cellulosomal expansin-like proteins have been functionally characterized to date. Results Sequence analyses of expansin-like proteins from the anaerobic fungus Neocallimastix californiae revealed similar N-terminal domains among proteins with or without appended dockerins. Those without dockerins, however, consistently lacked the first conserved aromatic residue that forms the substrate binding surface of the C-terminal family 63 carbohydrate binding module. One cellulosomal expansin-like protein from N. californiae ( Nca EXLX1) was recombinantly expressed with and without ( Nca EXLX1tr) the dockerin domains. The adsorption characteristics of Nca EXLX1 and Nca EXLX1tr, and impact on cellulase (Cel7B) activity, were then investigated using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). Nca EXLX1 exhibited higher binding to cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) compared to Nca EXLX1tr. Despite the lower binding of Nca EXLX1tr to CNF, both Nca EXLX1 and Nca EXLX1tr enhanced the action of Cel7B to similar extents. Conclusions This study reports the production and characterization of a fungal cellulosomal expansin-like protein. The corresponding Nca EXLX1 protein and truncated variant were shown to enhance the activity of an endoglucanase, similar to observations made with non-cellulosomal expansin-like proteins. Notably, the improvement in cellulase activity upon the addition of Nca EXLX1 or Nca EXLX1tr was not correlated to extent of substrate binding. Graphical Abstract",

Using fecal egg counts (FECs) from those infections, dogs were ranked and randomized to groups (Studies 1, 3, and 4, 10 per group; Study 2, 8 per group and treated once orally, on day 0, with the minimum recommended IVP dose (fluralaner 10 mg/kg, moxidectin 0.025 mg/kg, pyrantel 5 mg/kg) ( BRAVECTO ® TriUNO, MSD), or left untreated. Approximately 2 weeks later, both groups in all studies were treated orally with a diagnostic dewormer (DDW) containing emodepside-praziquantel (Profender ® modified-release Tablets for Dogs, Vetoquinol). The primary efficacy objective was determined by counts of expelled worms recovered after DDW treatment. Copro-antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and FECs were completed at key time points. Results Adequacy of infection was shown in all studies. Relative to the control groups, statistically significant reductions in mean worm counts were found in IVP-treated groups in Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4 (99.8%, P &lt; 0.0001; 100%, P = 0.0002; 100%, P &lt; 0.0001; and 99.4%, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively). All control dogs had positive FECs until the DDW treatment, while no eggs were detected after day 0 in 36 of the 38 IVP-treated dogs. Findings from copro-PCR and antigen-ELISA were consistent with and confirmatory of the conclusions from worm counts and FECs. Conclusions A single, orally administered dose of this chewable tablet formulation is effective in treating canine infections with adult hookworms ( U. stenocephala , A. caninum ) and T. leonina . Non-terminal studies present a valid means of determining the efficacy of anthelmintic treatments for these canine intestinal parasites. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Antibiotic use in infants is hypothesized to alter the gut microbiota, influencing immune system dysregulation and increasing allergy risk. We aim to assess the prevalence of allergic diseases in children treated with different classes of antibiotics in early life. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted from April 2024 to January 2025 in three main hospitals in the West Bank in Palestine. Records of pediatric admissions of children who received antibiotic treatment within their first six months of life were reviewed, followed by parents’ interview regarding the development of allergies. Results A total of 423 medical records were included. The average age of children was 7.33 ± 1.38 years (mean ± SD), and 62.41% of them were males. The total prevalence of allergic diseases was 29.55%. Common manifestations of allergies were skin reactions (70.4%), wheezing (16.8%), and respiratory symptoms (10.4%). Among the most common reported triggers were food (10.17%) and dust (7.33%). The most commonly prescribed antibiotics were Beta-lactams; cefotaxime (78.49%), and ampicillin (63.59%). No statistically significant association was found between the number of antibiotics used and the development of allergies ( p = 0.45). Similarly, different classes of antibiotics did not show an impact on developing allergies except for Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole ( p = 0.05). A significant decrease in allergy was observed with increasing age ( p = 0.011). Conclusion Allergic conditions affect about one third of children treated with antibiotics in early life. While allergic conditions tended to decrease with age, no association was observed between antibiotic number/class and later allergy, except for a hypothesis-generating signal toward lower odds with TMP-SMX.",

However, current clinical cancer treatment strategies fail to account for these differences. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms of tumor disparities between sexes remain elusive. Sex differences in sex chromosomes, hormone levels, metabolism, and immunity synergistically contribute to tumor-related disparities. As the demand for precision medicine escalates, there is an urgent need to conduct further exploration and research to address the tumor differences between sexes. In this review, we discuss the impact of biological sex differences on tumor cells and the tumor microenvironment, aiming to identify more effective strategies for tumor prevention and treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Limited experimental data remains a key challenge in applying machine learning to drug discovery, particularly for cancer-related targets. In this study, we present a data-efficient active meta-deep learning framework to predict mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) inhibitors, which are promising candidates for cancer-related therapies. Our approach integrates active learning (AL) with a meta-model that combines four deep architectures: a convolutional neural network, an attention, a graph convolutional network, and a graph neural network-attention, trained on molecular descriptors and graph-based representations. These models generate four probability-based features that feed into an attention-based meta-learner, improving predictive performance by 5.12% in the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and 5.48% in the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) using only 10% of the training data. Among the AL sampling strategies evaluated, entropy sampling showed competitive performance in selecting informative molecules for model improvement. Overall, our framework achieves an AUPRC of 0.835 ± 0.017 and MCC of 0.817 ± 0.017, on par with a traditional training method despite using only 26.7% of the training data. Compared to a conventional random forest model trained on brute-force, a 100% full training set, our approach shows a 10.6% improvement in AUPRC and modest gains in MCC, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Under severe class imbalance, balanced accuracy steadily increased across AL iterations, reaching values greater than 0.85 at the final iteration for all uncertainty-driven strategies. Molecular docking confirmed successful prioritization of the top four predicted compounds. Evaluation on an external MAPK1 data set demonstrated generalizability, with our approach achieving an AUPRC of 0.818 and an MCC of 0.403, comparable to the independent test set. These results highlight the potential of combining intelligent data selection with deep learning architectures through the meta-model to accelerate predictive performance in data-scarce drug discovery. Scientific contribution: This study contributes a novel, data-efficient active meta-deep learning framework for predicting MAPK1 inhibitors, addressing the challenge of limited experimental data in a cancer-specific target. By integrating AL with a meta-model composed of four deep architectures, the approach significantly enhances the predictive performance using only a fraction of the training data. The framework achieves superior metrics compared to traditional training methods, highlighting its potential to accelerate drug discovery in data-scarce settings.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The antemortem diagnosis of aspergillosis in birds remains a complex challenge. A variety of diagnostic methods are currently available, including direct detection of Aspergillus components, antibody-based assays, and nonspecific markers such as serum protein electrophoresis (SPE), but their diagnostic performances remain limited. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the performances of several diagnostic approaches, specifically, galactomannan index measurement, beta-D-glucan assay, 3-hydroxybutyrate quantification, SPE, and mannoprotein detection tests. A secondary objective was to develop a predictive model of aspergillosis incorporating optimal test thresholds identified in the first phase, combined with clinical signs. A total of 101 serum and 31 plasma samples were collected from 118 aquatic bird of various species in France. Birds were classified into three categories: control individuals ( n = 88), suspected aspergillosis cases ( n = 7), and confirmed cases ( n = 23). While individually considered tests displayed limitations in specificity, predictive modeling revealed that elevated levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate above 0.52 mmol/L (Se = 96%, Sp = 51%) combined with beta-globulins above 6.90 g/L (Se = 78%, Sp = 51%), in conjunction with concurrent respiratory clinical signs, were significantly associated with the occurrence of aspergillosis. A multivariable logistic model combining these variables achieved excellent diagnostic performance, with AUCs up to 0.98 and sensitivity above 98%. These findings suggest that these parameters, particularly when considered alongside clinical signs, may serve as more reliable indicators for detecting aspergillosis in birds.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Key message The 2024 ENSO event advanced the timing of spring phenological phases of native shrubs significantly more than non-native shrubs and native trees in a temperate deciduous woodland fragment in Wisconsin, USA. This suggests that, as spring temperatures warm, shrubs will likely play a pivotal role in forest dynamics including contributing to an earlier onset to the growing period and an early start to CO 2 assimilation. Context The 2023/2024 El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event brought warmer than average temperatures to the Midwest USA. This presented a unique opportunity to examine how short-term warming might impact the phenology of temperate deciduous forest vegetation. Aim To quantify the impact of an ENSO-driven warm spring on the phenology of temperate deciduous forest vegetation in order to assess how trees and shrubs respond to short-term temperature anomalies. Methods Spring phenology was recorded twice weekly (2018–2024) on 5 dominant tree species and 5 native and 4 non-native shrub species, in a woodland fragment on the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee campus. In addition, phenological transition dates were extracted from daily Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC) data from a PhenoCam installed at the site. Results In 2024, the average spring (March–May) temperature (8.7 ± 0.57 °C) was significantly warmer than the 2018–2023 average (6.7 ± 0.28 °C). Compared to the average of the previous 6 years, the timing of budburst in 2024 occurred significantly ( p &lt; 0.001) earlier on DOY 76, 82, and 98 for native shrubs, non-native shrubs, and trees, representing advances of 20, 17, and 18 days, respectively. The advance was greater in shrubs than trees suggesting that any future advance to the start of the growing-season in temperate deciduous forests resulting from warmer spring temperatures will likely be driven by early leafing species like shrubs. Notably, the rise in GCC in 2024 (DOY 116) occurred following budburst, indicating that PhenoCam imagery may not fully capture early vegetation phenology. Conclusion Early leafing shrubs, and in particular native species, were more sensitive to warmer temperatures early in the season than non-native shrubs and native trees. Therefore, as temperatures warm in the future, the onset of growth in temperate deciduous forests is likely to be driven by the early spring phenophases of early leafing species.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Rumen microbiota drive fermentation and contribute to variation in feed efficiency among ruminants, yet the underlying host–microbe mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study explores how rumen microbes shape feed conversion efficiency (FCR) through integrated interactions with multiple host organs. Results We applied a multi-omics strategy—combining rumen metagenomics and host multi-organ transcriptomics—in Hu sheep with divergent FCR. From a uniform cohort of 150 weaned male Hu lambs, 13 low-FCR (LFCR) and 13 high-FCR (HFCR) individuals were selected for integrated analyses. LFCR sheep exhibited greater growth performance and higher ruminal propionate concentrations compared with HFCR animals. The ruminal microbiomes were enriched in Saccharofermentans and Succinivibrionaceae_UBA2804, and showed functional convergence on amino acid biosynthesis, central carbon metabolism, and propionate-oriented fermentation in LFCR sheep. Carbohydrate-active enzyme profiles indicated that LFCR animals favored fiber- and starch-associated modules (GH126, CBM27, EPS-GT), whereas HFCR animals were enriched in host-glycan and uronic acid–degrading families (CE14, GH89, PL15). Hydrogen metabolism highlighted a clear dichotomy: LFCR animals redirected H₂ toward propionate and sulfate reduction, while HFCR animals retained greater butyrate-producing and methanogenic capacity. Transcriptomic profiling across rumen epithelium, liver, and muscle identified tissue-specific regulatory modules. Only the liver showed strong enrichment of carbohydrate metabolism, with a complete glycogen turnover and glucose export system ( GYS2 , PYGL , PGM2 , G6PC1 ) and pathways linking microbial short-chain fatty acids to gluconeogenesis. In contrast, muscle efficiency modules were dominated by contractile and cytoskeletal genes (e.g., MYL2 , TNNC1 , TPM3 ), reflecting optimized energy expenditure rather than substrate metabolism. No efficiency-associated modules were detected in the rumen epithelium, consistent with its role in propionate absorption rather than metabolism. Conclusions The rumen microbiota of LFCR sheep possess highly efficient capacities for volatile fatty acid and amino acid synthesis, thereby enhancing energy utilization at its source. The resulting propionate further promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis, directly supplying energy for muscle cell growth and ultimately improving FCR. Thus, co-metabolism between rumen microbiota and the liver provides energy for muscle cell growth and is a key determinant of improved feed efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The ANZAED (Australia and New Zealand Academy for Eating Disorders) Eating Disorder Credential is the first national, cross-disciplinary program to recognise minimum standards qualifications, knowledge, training, and ongoing professional development for health professionals to provide safe and effective treatment. While timely access to safe and effective treatment is known to improve quality of life and increase the likelihood of optimal treatment outcomes, there is currently no empirical evidence on the Credential’s impact for people with an eating disorder (ED). To address this gap, this study explored the perceptions and treatment experiences of individuals with an ED who received care from a Credentialed Eating Disorder Clinician. Methods Participants were 16 people with lived experience of an ED, who had received treatment from a credentialed clinician. Participants engaged in a semi-structured interview and an online self-report survey, both exploring their ED treatment experiences. Analysis included descriptive statistics from survey data and an inductive reflexive thematic analysis of interview transcripts. Results The first theme generated by the thematic analysis was treatment experiences with credentialed vs. non-credentialed clinicians, with (1) trust and safety, (2) seeing the whole person, and (3) teamwork identified as subthemes. The second theme was attitudes towards the Credential, with (1) the perception of the Credential as a source of hope and (2) the potential for improved access to appropriate treatment as subthemes. Conclusions Participants consistently perceived treatment with credentialed clinicians positively and felt that additional training and supervision facilitated trust in credentialed clinicians. Some participants reported their treatment team consisted of credentialed clinicians working together to coordinate treatment, which was also perceived to facilitate trust. However, some participants felt uncertain about whether the Credential met their needs and instead emphasised the importance of treatment access in regional locations and an understanding of individual presentations including comorbid conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Cardiac rehabilitation programs are commonly employed to address modifiable lifestyle factors, such as physical inactivity. However, adherence to exercise recommendations following these interventions remains suboptimal. Psychological burdens can further impede patients’ ability to exercise. Aim The aim of this study was to investigate the role of exercise self-efficacy (ESE) in influencing physical activity among psychologically distressed patients in cardiac rehabilitation. Methods Data from a randomized controlled trial involving 305 participants who completed a four-week cardiac rehabilitation program were analyzed. ESE was measured using the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale, while physical activity was assessed by aggregating the duration and frequency of up to three weekly activity types participants engaged in. Correlation analyses were conducted to examine the relationships between ESE and potential explanatory variables. A linear regression model was employed to assess the predictive role of baseline ESE on physical activity at the 3-month follow-up. Changes in ESE and physical activity over time were analyzed using paired t-tests and a mixed-effects model. Results At the start of rehabilitation, weekly physical activity averaged 108 min, while ESE reached a mean of 28.2 points. Baseline ESE significantly predicted physical activity at the 3-month follow-up when controlling for baseline activity (b = 0.10, p = 0.006). T-tests showed a 1.75-point increase in ESE ( p &lt; 0.001) and a 68.23-minute increase in physical activity ( p &lt; 0.001) over time. Mixed-effects regression analysis indicated that each one-point increase in ESE was associated with a 12.88-minute increase in physical activity at follow-up ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion ESE may have a considerable impact on physical activity among psychologically distressed patients in cardiac rehabilitation and should therefore be considered as a relevant outcome parameter when designing new intervention components. For clinical practice, these findings support the integration of routine screening for ESE upon rehabilitation entry as well as the incorporation of targeted strategies to enhance self-efficacy within cardiac rehabilitation programs.

    "Abstract": "Large-scale traumatic events such as earthquakes have profound and long-lasting impacts on individuals' psychological well-being. However, the protective mechanisms that may foster adjustment and support life satisfaction in the aftermath of such disasters remain insufficiently explored. This longitudinal study examined the mediating role of psychological adjustment in the relationship between mindfulness and life satisfaction among young adult earthquake survivors. Data were collected through two web-based surveys conducted approximately six months apart. The final sample consisted of 277 Turkish young adults (58.5% female; M = 21.52, SD = 2.29). Using a cross-lagged panel model for a half-longitudinal design, the findings revealed that mindfulness at Time 1 significantly predicted higher psychological adjustment at Time 2, which in turn contributed to greater life satisfaction. Moreover, psychological adjustment mediated the longitudinal association between mindfulness and life satisfaction. In this context, the findings suggest that mindfulness-based interventions and structured psychological counseling can effectively support life satisfaction and post-trauma adjustment, offering practical guidance for post-disaster mental health practices.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The antibiotics doxycycline and metronidazole play a vital role in the treatment of infections and diseases. To identify and quantify these two important antibiotics in biological samples, fluorescence spectroscopy was employed. Carbon quantum dots synthesized via a hydrothermal method using yeast, tungsten, and sulfur were used as sensitive probes for the detection and measurement of doxycycline and metronidazole. The synthesized quantum dots were characterized using SEM, EDX, and IR techniques. The results demonstrated that fluorescence spectroscopy can be used as a sensitive and accurate method for the identification and quantification of doxycycline and metronidazole in biological samples. This approach can contribute to the improvement of infection treatment and the maintenance of human health. Compared to other spectroscopic techniques, fluorescence spectroscopy offers advantages such as high speed, low cost, high accuracy, and high sensitivity, as well as the ability to reuse samples. In conclusion, the use of fluorescence spectroscopy with carbon quantum dots as a probe for the identification and quantification of doxycycline and metronidazole in biological samples is an effective and efficient method that can play a significant role in the treatment of infections and the preservation of human health.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Accurate differentiation between luminal A and B subtypes of breast cancer is critical for selecting therapeutic strategies. However, current approaches rely predominantly on invasive biopsy and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Therefore, the development of non-invasive imaging-based methods capable of reliably classifying tumor subtypes remains an urgent task. Methods To develop and validate a hybrid classification model combining radiomic and deep learning features extracted from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to differentiate between luminal A and B subtypes of invasive breast cancer. The study included 312 women from China, Russia and Bulgaria with confirmed luminal subtypes of breast cancer. All patients underwent standardized pre-treatment DCE-MRI, and subtypes were determined using IHC. Tumors were semi-automatically segmented, and radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics. Additionally, deep features were extracted from DCE-MRI using a 3D ResNet-50 convolutional neural network. Three models were constructed: a radiomics-based model, a deep learning-based model, and a hybrid model that integrated both approaches using a stacking ensemble method. Model performance was evaluated using AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and other metrics on a test dataset and an independent external validation cohort ( n = 148). SHAP and Grad-CAM techniques were applied for model interpretability. Results The hybrid model significantly outperformed the individual approaches, achieving an AUC of 0.921, sensitivity of 88.6%, and specificity of 89.7% on the test dataset. Performance remained robust in the external validation cohort (AUC = 0.903). Statistical tests (DeLong and bootstrapping) confirmed the significance of these differences. The most important contributors were radiomic features related to shape and texture (e.g., entropy, sphericity) and high-level deep features. Visualizations highlighted clinically relevant model attention areas. Conclusion The proposed hybrid approach represents a clinically applicable, non-invasive method for classifying breast cancer subtypes, potentially complementing or partially replacing biopsy in selected cases. It enhances diagnostic accuracy while maintaining interpretability. Future work will focus on prospective validation and integration with genomic and clinical data within the framework of precision oncology.",

First, it employs a dynamic heterogeneous panel threshold model to examine potential threshold effects of FDI on TFP. Second, and more critically, it investigates whether the trajectory of FDI influences this relationship. Using a sample of 71 developed and developing countries over the period 1980–2014, the study reveals new insights. For developing countries, the findings provide some support for a threshold effect and strong evidence for the importance of the FDI trajectory. Notably, the results suggest that the trajectory of FDI is more influential than its level in promoting TFP growth. However, for developed countries, no threshold or trajectory effects are observed. The key policy implication is that maintaining a steady and sustained flow of FDI is essential for enhancing TFP growth, particularly in developing economies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Unlike the previous literature, this study develops a comprehensive index of CEO education that considers levels and quality in bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral (PhD) programs and examines how they relate to corporate policies such as capital expenditures, research and development expenditures (R&amp;D), leverage, liquidity, and dividends. The findings indicate that the quality and level of PhD education are positively associated with R&amp;D and liquidity but are negatively associated with leverage and capital expenditures. The quality and level of master’s education negatively impact R&amp;D, leverage, and liquidity. Bachelor’s degree is positively associated with dividends and leverage but negatively impacts R&amp;D and liquidity. The propensity score matching, however, does not support the baseline results concerning the positive impact of having a bachelor’s degree on capital expenditures. Extended analyses suggest that powerful CEOs with a higher level and quality of education tend to make decisions with excessive risk or poor-quality decision-making. Additionally, the media’s intensive coverage of CEOs with a higher level and quality of education increases their desire to pursue conservative corporate policies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Financial literacy and financial information sources are crucial in influencing investors’ risky investment behavior, which is reflected in their investment decisions and performance. However, these relationships have not been fully explored, particularly in the context of Bangladesh. Understanding how different types of financial literacy interact with financial information sources can assist investors in making informed investment decisions and achieving better performance. This study offers a unique perspective by differentiating two types of financial literacy—basic financial literacy and financial market literacy—in investigating the link between risky investment behavior and five types of financial information sources—advisors, brokers, friends &amp; family, financial reports, and media coverage. Data were collected through a self-administered structured questionnaire from 474 retail investors in Bangladesh, and hypotheses were tested via multivariate regression models. All financial information sources are highly significant, suggesting that information sourced from advisors, brokers, friends &amp; family, financial reports, and media coverage importantly influences investors’ investment decisions and performance. Specifically, basic financial literacy strengthens the informational effects of advisors and brokers on investors’ investment decisions, whereas financial market literacy weakens the impact of information sourced from friends and family. With respect to investment performance, basic financial literacy improves the informational effects of advisors, whereas advanced financial literacy strengthens the informational impacts of brokers. Additionally, the moderation effects of financial literacy are contingent on investors’ financial interest and risk tolerance levels, suggesting the importance of recognizing investors’ unique traits. These findings expand academic understanding, support policy interventions in designing targeted financial literacy programs, and provide insights for investors in formulating investment strategies that align with their financial interest and risk tolerance levels.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The usual asset pricing models perform well when large datasets are available, particularly with the advent of big data and artificial intelligence. However, they are generally unable to meet current assessment needs when only few data are available. For example, in agricultural land valuation, farmland transactions are generally non-recurring actions for most buyers and sellers, and expert knowledge is often the sole source of information, posing significant challenges for decision-makers. A valuation method based on two distribution (or reliability) functions was developed to estimate asset value using only expert-based knowledge of the asset and its characteristics. However, this comparative method and its multidimensional extensions tend to produce extreme valuations. This paper introduces competing risks and complementary risks models within this probabilistic framework to support asset valuation under high uncertainty and data scarcity. The proposed method synchronizes the asset value distribution with the minimum and maximum statistics of the explanatory variables, yielding more moderate and realistic valuations. The results confirm that embedding these risk models refines asset assessments by mitigating the appraisal biases induced by the two-function valuation methods across any k -dimensional explanatory vector. Empirical evidence from two applications in agricultural land valuation supports the theoretical findings. The results show minimal impact of the shape parameters on valuation outcomes and limited sensitivity to the expert’s most likely value, exhibiting reasonable performance. Accordingly, the minimum and maximum statistics can serve as stochastic smoothing tools for valuation, thereby extending the applicability of valuation methods in data-scarce markets.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The complex dynamics of global development have turned crude oil from a critical strategic commodity into a powerful tool for political‒military influence. This study aims to forecast the price of OPEC crude oil by simultaneously considering the complex interaction between financial markets, the multifaceted political landscape of the Middle East, and the inherent complexity of oil markets. What they all have in common is their inherent uncertainty. To address this challenge, since this work seeks to identify a robust set of explanatory variables affecting oil prices, the adaptive neural-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) was employed. A set of input variables with different points of view, which are the time series of monthly data from 2001 to 2019, are considered. In ANFIS, the Sugeno system and the C-Means clustering method are used. The results show the influence of different oil markets on each other, and among the unconventional variables, economic policy uncertainty is not influential, whereas terrorist attacks and geopolitical risk influence it. The numerical results following the implementation of the proposed model show a significant increase of 0.4417 compared with the conventional modeling approaches in this field. This discrepancy highlights the advantages of the proposed methodology.",

We use data on the total recommended rejections and acceptances for all referees who reviewed at least one paper for the Journal of Financial Economics (JFE) between 1994 and 2020. We show that reviewers who write more reports are more likely to recommend the acceptance of manuscripts. We also find that older reviewers, those who graduated from or are affiliated with prestigious universities, and those with more and highly cited publications are more likely to recommend acceptance. There is also some evidence that reviewers with doctoral training in economics, mathematics, physics, and engineering are more likely to recommend acceptance than those with a PhD in finance. We find no consistent evidence of significant differences between genders or among reviewer demographic characteristics. We also document that reviewers who themselves publish more successfully in JFE and publish highly cited articles are, ceteris paribus , more likely to recommend rejection of reviewed manuscripts.

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the determinants of global textile waste trade by comparing the influence of traditional geographic distances with emerging nongeographic distances, including sustainability, resource intensity, and income disparities. Employing a cross-sectional gravity model framework for the year 2024, the analysis draws on bilateral trade data between the top 34 textile waste exporters and their importing partners. Findings reveal that while geographic distance remains statistically insignificant, nongeographic dimensions such as income and resource intensity distances play a critical role in explaining variation in trade volumes. This suggests a shift in global trade dynamics, where institutional and environmental asymmetries outweigh traditional physical distance. The study introduces the concept of “circular advantage” as a strategic lens to assess trade competitiveness in waste-related sectors. The implications are vital for trade and sustainability policymakers seeking to realign waste governance with circular economy goals.",

These developments have not only refined our understanding of polyploid cotton genomes but also facilitated the tracing of introgressed chromosomal segments in hybrid breeding programs. By integrating molecular cytogenetics with modern genomic tools, cotton breeding has transitioned toward a precision-oriented approach, allowing for targeted genetic improvements and efficient utilization of wild germplasm.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Code clone detection has garnered significant attention across various fields, including code refactoring, plagiarism detection, and software maintenance. Numerous methods have been proposed for detecting code clones; however, while text-based and token-based approaches are scalable, they often fail to consider code semantics and are unable to effectively handle semantic code clones. Although tree-based methods perform well in semantic code clone detection, they are limited by the complex structure of trees, making it challenging to apply to large-scale clone detection. Moreover, these methods struggle to achieve fine-grained semantic code clone detection, lacking the ability to pinpoint specific code blocks within semantic clones. In this paper, we propose Rator , a tree-based code clone detector that combines scalability and fine-grained analysis capabilities while effectively detecting semantic clones. Specifically, we design a tree encoding method based on node degrees of freedom, which can transform complex tree structures into simple vector representations while preserving the structural details of the tree. In this way, we can encode all the subtrees of the abstract syntax tree into separate sets of vectors and derive similar features by calculating the similarity between these vectors. The derived similar features serve dual purposes: firstly, they are employed to train a machine learning-based code clone detector, and then, by analyzing the subtree types corresponding to the feature values, specific clone code blocks can be precisely located, thus achieving fine-grained code clone detection. Experimental results show that Rator outperforms nine state-of-the-art code clone detectors with F1 scores of 0.99 and 0.91 on BigCloneBench and Google Code Jam datasets, respectively. As for scalability, Rator is about 93 times faster than ASTNN , another state-of-the-art tree-based semantic clone detector. Regarding fine-grained detection, Rator correctly identifies the concrete clone block with a Top-3 ranked list. Furthermore, the accuracy of fine-grained detection on the Google Code Jam dataset is up to 100% with a Top-2 ranked list.",

Xanthomonas pathovars exhibit remarkable host specificity and adaptability, and are capable of infecting a variety of staple crops, including rice, citrus, and tomato. While Xanthomonas usually infects the host plant alone, it can also interact with other pathogens, forming plant disease complexes. This review summarizes recent advances in the study of Xanthomonas co-infections with bacteria, fungi, viruses, and nematodes. The interaction relationships, including competition, cooperation, and coexistence, are discussed. Moreover, possible interaction mechanisms between Xanthomonas and other pathogens within the plant disease complexes are highlighted. This review aims to provide a better understanding of Xanthomonas co-infections with multiple pathogens and to serve as a reference for studying disease complexes among various plant pathogens.",

Spearman analysis and multiple regression analysis were applied for further analysis of clinical factors and regions exhibiting abnormal gray matter intensity. Results The individual SPM analysis of DIR images revealed gray matter abnormalities in 15 out of 31 IGE patients, affecting regions including the temporal lobe, frontal lobe, limbic lobe, occipital lobe, brainstem, insular lobe, parietal lobe, thalamus and cerebellum. Intergroup DIR-SPM analysis comparing IGE patients to healthy controls showed a significant increase in gray matter density in the left temporal lobe ( x = -44, y = -56, z = 6, Z score = 4.58, P FWE = 0.041; x = -48, y = -40, z = -12, Z score = 4.54, P FWE = 0.047). Generalized spike wave discharges (GSWDs) were positively correlated with the number of voxels exhibiting significantly altered gray matter intensity in each individual with IGE ( P FDR = 0.032). However, the multiple regression model did not identify any significant brain regions influencing the occurrences of GSWDs. Conclusions In the IGE group, various regions exhibited alterations in gray matter density according to either individual or group DIR-SPM analysis. The frequency of GSWDs were correlated with the abnormal voxel count across the entire brain cortex of each individual with IGE.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study addresses a critical gap in the literature by examining the tripartite relationship between Business Intelligence (BI), Digital Culture, and Smart Organization development within Jordanian pharmaceutical firms. While prior research has often explored these constructs in isolation or pairwise, this study introduces theoretical novelty by uniquely conceptualizing Digital Culture as a catalytic moderator that amplifies the impact of BI capabilities on organizational smartness. Through a survey of 102 senior and middle managers and employing hierarchical regression analysis with interaction terms, we find that BI dimensions collectively explain 59.9% of the variance in Smart Organization development. Crucially, the interaction between BI and Digital Culture is significant, contributing an additional 44.1% explanatory power and underscoring its role as a strategic multiplier. This study offers a validated, integrative framework for knowledge-intensive industries, demonstrating that the synergistic alignment of technological infrastructure and cultural readiness is essential for achieving sustainable competitive advantage in dynamic, regulated markets.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Bell’s palsy affects both facial motor function and psychosocial well-being. The Sunnybrook Facial Grading System (SFGS) and the Facial Disability Index (FDI) are widely used to assess objective and subjective outcomes, respectively. This study aimed to explore the correlation between SFGS and FDI in a clinical cohort of patients with Bell’s palsy. Methods A total of 114 patients with Bell’s palsy were assessed using the SFGS and FDI at baseline and at 4-week follow-up during routine physiotherapy care. Pearson’s correlation was used to examine relationships between SFGS components and FDI domains. Results At baseline, a significant negative correlation was found between Synkinesis and FDI Physical Function (r = –0.196, p = 0.036), and a positive correlation between Voluntary Movement and FDI Social Function (r = 0.239, p = 0.010). At 4-week follow-up, Voluntary Movement was positively correlated with FDI Physical Function (r = 0.240, p = 0.010), and Composite Score was positively correlated with FDI Physical Function (r = 0.262, p = 0.005). Resting Symmetry was negatively correlated with FDI Physical Function (r = –0.209, p = 0.026). Conclusion The study demonstrates a moderate but significant correlation between SFGS and FDI, especially at follow-up. Combining objective and subjective measures provides a more holistic understanding of facial paralysis recovery and can guide individualized rehabilitation strategies.",

Integrated genomic and transcriptomic analyses identified 46,909 genes, including 72 UrWRKY transcription factors. Sixty-four candidate genes for monoterpenoid indole alkaloid (MIA) biosynthesis were screened. Functional validation confirmed UrTDC6 catalyzes tryptamine formation and UrLAMT1/UrLAMT2 catalyze loganin production. Correlation analysis linked MIA content with UrWRKY expression, identifying UrWRKY37 as a key regulator. UrWRKY37 directly activates UrTDC and UrSGD transcription. Overexpression in hairy roots upregulated MIA pathway genes and significantly increased accumulation of isocorynoxeine, corynoxeine, and isorhynchophylline.

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE Despite evidence of diagnostic accuracy but unclear long-term clinical benefit, national utilization patterns of prostate-specific membrane antigen positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) are undefined. METHODS We conducted a serial cross-sectional study to evaluate the use of PET imaging among commercial insurance beneficiaries with prostate cancer using administrative claims from deidentified Blue Cross Blue Shield Axis database. Eligible patients included prevalent and incident prostate cancer cases. We calculated the proportions undergoing PET imaging in semiannual periods from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2024. We examined the association between regional-level contextual sociodemographic and health care characteristics, and regional use of PSMA-PET imaging in 2024. RESULTS A total of 514,750 male beneficiaries age 40-89 years with prostate cancer were identified between 2016 and 2024. The proportion of individuals with prostate cancer undergoing PET imaging increased from 4.5 [95% CI, 4.1 to 4.9] per 1,000 in the first half of 2016 to 77.6 (95% CI, 76.2 to 79.1) per 1,000 in the second half of 2024, P &lt; .001. Increases in PET were driven by uptake of PSMA-PET following approval in 2021, which increased from 0.8 (95% CI, 0.6 to 0.9) per 1,000 in the second half of 2021 to 77.0 (95% CI, 75.5 to 78.5) per 1,000 in the second half of 2024, P &lt; .001. PSMA-PET use in 2024 was higher in regions with greater education (99.3 v 114.6 per 1,000 in lowest [Q1] v highest [Q4] educated) and income (95.4 v 112.3 per 1,000 in Q1 v Q4 income) measures, P &lt; .001. CONCLUSION PSMA-PET was rapidly incorporated into clinical practice among commercial insurance beneficiaries with prostate cancer with higher adoption in geographic regions with higher income and education.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Context Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of genetic loci linked with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Methods To identify liver-expressed genes that may represent therapeutic candidates for MASLD, we conducted a new GWAS meta-analysis including 16,532 cases and 1,240,188 controls. We also generated RNA sequencing data of liver samples and genome-wide genotyping of 504 individuals of the Quebec Obesity Biobank. Results Using Mendelian randomization (MR) and genetic colocalization, we confirm the implication of genes previously linked with MASLD and identified novel ones including AKNA (AT-hook transcription factor), EPHA2 (EPH receptor A2), CHEK2 (encoding Checkpoint kinase 2) and PCCB (Propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunit beta). More specifically, we found a strong and positive effect of the long non-coding RNA TRIB1AL on MASLD. The lead genetic variant was not linked with expression levels of the nearby protein-coding gene TRIB1 (Tribbles Pseudokinase 1). In participants of the UK Biobank with whole exome sequencing data available, rare loss-of-function variants in TRIB1 were not associated with liver fat accumulation or plasma triglyceride levels, suggesting that the long non-coding RNA TRIB1AL may carry cardiometabolic effects independently of TRIB1. Targeted- and phenome-wide MR also identified lower liver-expressed TRIB1AL as being associated with reduced liver fat accumulation, lower plasma lipoprotein-lipid levels and decreased atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk. Conclusions These results open the door to liver-targeted therapeutics silencing of the non-coding genome for the prevention and treatment of MASLD and cardiometabolic diseases.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) has been the predominant surgical corridor for the craniopharyngioma in the past decade. Retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas pose a more difficult challenge. The narrow space between the tumor and the optic chiasm makes it difficult to have an effective and balanced protocol between aggressive therapy and reducing adverse symptoms. We have developed a meticulous method with extradural posterior clinoidectomy (EPC) and upper clivectomy (UC). Here, we present a series of such patients demonstrating its safety and efficacy. METHODS: Between 2016 and 2022, we resected 35 consecutive nonelderly patients of retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas by using EEA with EPC and UC. We analyzed the efficacy of EPC and UC, and determinants of the extent of resection and outcomes in retrochiasmatic craniopharyngiomas. RESULTS: By adding EPC and UC to the standard EEA, the access route for the retrochiasmatic region has expanded from 9.7 to 19.7 mm. Gross total resection (GTR) was achieved in 28 patients, and near total resection (NTR) in 7. Anterior and posterior pituitary hormone replacement therapy was required in 33 patients at the last follow-up. Visual function status improved in 13 patients, whereas the other 22 patients remained unchanged postoperatively. Neuropsychological function status improved in 1 patient and was preserved in 34 patients. The mean duration of follow-up was 60.1 months. In the initial treatment patients (n = 20), there was no tumor recurrence in 19 GTR patients and 1 NTR patient. In retreatment patients (n = 15), tumor recurrence was detected in 5 of 9 GTR patients and in 2 of 6 NTR patients. CONCLUSION: EEA with EPC and UC for retrochiasmatic craniopharyngioma widens the surgical corridor significantly and offers the advantage to visualize the tumor origin, hypothalamus, and lower surface of the optic chiasm. EPC and UC aid in safe, maximum, and aggressive resection to decrease the tumor recurrence.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Findings have linked GNAS -activating mutations, frequent in appendiceal adenocarcinoma (AA), with improved overall survival but poor response to chemotherapy. The authors hypothesized that GNAS -activating mutations are associated with differential outcomes in AA treated with chemotherapy. Methods Patients seen at the authors’ center between 2013 and 2023 who received systemic chemotherapy for metastatic/recurrent AA were identified. The primary outcome was disease event-free survival (EFS), defined as time from start of chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil/capecitabine based) to earliest disease event, including death, clinical/radiographic recurrence, or progression. Study outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimations and Cox proportional hazards regression. Results The study included 48 patients. In 18 (37.5 %) of the 48 patients, GNAS -activating mutations were seen. Patients with GNAS mutations were more likely to have lower grades of disease ( p = 0.003), with lower proportions of lymphovascular invasion ( p = 0.005) and perineural invasion ( p = 0.03), but a higher median peritoneal carcinomatosis index ( p = 0.03). In the multivariable analysis, GNAS mutations (10.7 months [95 % confidence interval {CI}, 7.1–19.2] vs 20.3 months [95 % CI, 18.6–29.4; adjusted HR {aHR}, 3.75; 95 % CI, 1.84–7.63] p &lt; 0.001) and metachronous metastases (aHR, 5.14; 95 % CI, 2.08–12.69; p &lt; 0.001) were associated with worse EFS. Both CC0-1 resection (aHR, 0.12; 95 % CI, 0.05–0.28; p &lt; 0.001) and CC2-3 resection (aHR, 0.28; 95 % CI, 0.10–0.81; p = 0.02) were associated with prolonged EFS. There was no significant difference in the OS from the date of metastases diagnosis between the GNAS mt and GNAS wt patients (HR, 0.68; 95 % CI, 0.31–1.47; p = 0.33). Conclusions With systemic chemotherapy, GNAS -mutated metastatic/recurrent AAs have worse EFS despite less frequent high-risk features. Routine somatic mutation-testing of patients with AA should be considered for prognostication and possibly therapeutic decision-making.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are rare malignancies with limited treatment options beyond surgery, particularly in advanced stages, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Featured by pronounced biologic heterogeneity, PNETs are driven by dysregulation of complex molecular-signaling pathways during tumor progression. This underscores the importance of biologically relevant and cost-effective preclinical models that allow convenient real-time monitoring of tumor progression and tracking of individual tumor cells, a current gap in the field. Methods To address this challenge, the authors engineered a novel enteroendocrine tumor-derived STC-1 murine cell line that stably co-expresses firefly luciferase (F-Luc) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). These dual-labeled cells were implanted into immunocompromised mice via three different routes: subcutaneous (SubQ), renal capsule (RC), and orthotopic pancreatic (OP) injections. Tumor growth was tracked using bioluminescence in vivo imaging, and PNET characteristics were assessed by histologic, immunohistochemical (IHC) and co-immunofluorescence analyses. Results Tumors formed in all three models. The SubQ model showed rapid tumor growth but lacked key PNET features based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and IHC staining. The RC model exhibited moderate growth but limited expression of PNET-specific markers. In contrast, the OP model demonstrated robust tumor growth and most closely resembled well-differentiated, grade 1 human PNETs. Lineage-tracing experiments further exhibited clonal architecture and dynamic progression within the OP model. Conclusions Orthotopic pancreatic implantation of dual-labeled STC-1 cells provides a biologically relevant and pragmatic preclinical platform that closely resembles human PNETs. This model offers valuable utility for investigating PNET biology and evaluating novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to assess: 1) the concurrent validity between critical power (CP) and the corrected power output at the respiratory compensation point (PO RCP ) and between W’ and the quantity of energy depleted above PO RCP (W’ mod-SRS ) in a modified Step-Ramp-Step (mod-SRS) protocol; 2) the test-retest reliability of endurance variables derived from a mod-SRS protocol. Methods: Twelve trained male triathletes (31 ± 6 yr, 67.9 ± 7.1 mL.min -1 .kg -1 ) performed i) a SRS protocol, ii) 4 to 5 severe-intensity Constant-Work Rate (CWR) trials, iii) two mod-SRS protocols (test/re-test) and iv) a heavy-intensity CWR trial. CP and W’ were computed using a “best individual fit” approach. PO RCP was corrected appropriately while W’ mod-SRS was computed as the energy depleted above PO RCP . Test-retest reliability was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the standard error of measurement (SEM) and the coefficient of variation (CV%). Results: CP was higher than PO RCP in both trials (bias = 19 ± 19 W and 17 ± 20 W, p = 0.019 and 0.045). W’ and W’ mod-SRS were similar between trials (bias = -2.8 ± 7.9 kJ and -5.4 ± 8.8 kJ, p = 0.735 and 0.173). Test-retest reliability was moderate for W’ mod-SRS (ICC = 0.66, SEM = 3.0 kJ, CV = 11.6%) and high for V̇O 2peak , GET, RCP and their associated PO values (ICCs = 0.85-0.95, SEMs = 68-184 mL.min -1 and 7-8W, CVs = 2.1-3.7%). Conclusions: The mod-SRS protocol reliably measures V̇O 2peak , GET and RCP. Corrected PO RCP systematically underestimated CP, which consequently impacts computation of W’ using a mod-SRS protocol. The design of the protocol may allow a more complete depletion of energy available above RCP while still eliciting V̇O 2peak .",

    "Abstract": "The persistence of knee extensor moment (KEM) deficits across rehabilitation post-ACL reconstruction (ACLr) may be attributed to difficulty detecting and addressing deficits clinically. During squats, large KEM deficits are present along with much smaller differences in joint or segment angles, making them difficult to detect visually. Data outputs from force plates and video technology may improve clinical identification. Purpose: Investigate the accuracy of three approaches to estimate KEM deficits using outputs from force plate and two-dimensional position data to identify individuals with surgical limb KEM deficits during a bilateral squat. Methods: Forty individuals post-ACLr performed bilateral squats. Kinematic and ground reaction force (GRF) data were collected via 3D motion capture system and tri-axial force plates. Surgical limb deficits were calculated using limb symmetry index (LSI: non-surgical/surgical) at peak knee flexion. Gold standard KEM was calculated using inverse dynamics. Vertical GRF was considered alone, and together with the center of pressure (COP) position to estimate deficits in GRF, and GRF-COP Approaches. Vector Approach used the product of vertical GRF and moment arm calculated using vertical and anterior/posterior GRF, COP and knee position in trigonometric equations. Separate linear regression and ICC(2,k) examined concurrent validity between gold standard LSI and LSI from GRF, GRF-COP, and Vector Approaches. Specificity and sensitivity (LSI threshold ≥ 0.85) determined diagnostic accuracy Results: GRF, GRF-COP, and Vector LSI’s predicted gold standard LSI (R² = 0.56, 0.74, and 0.85 respectively) with ICC(2,k) 0.49, 0.92, and 0.96; sensitivity of 72.2%, 94.4%, 100%, and specificity of 100%, 50%, 100%, respectively. Conclusions: Vertical GRF alone is not adequate to detect KEM deficits. Additional force plate and two-dimensional position data (COP position and moment arm) can strengthen predictive ability and diagnostic accuracy, supporting translation of these variables into commercial products to enhance clinical assessments.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the effect of downhill running on mitophagic flux and autophagosome-lysosome fusion in rat soleus muscle. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were trained on a treadmill at a speed of 16 m·min -1 and a decline of -16° for 90 min, and the soleus muscle was sampled at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after exercise. Mitochondrial ultrastructural changes were observed by using a transmission electron microscope. Protein levels of Cathepsin D (CTSD), Vacuolar H + -ATPase (V-ATPase), mitochondrial respiratory complex Ⅰ (NDUFB8), complex Ⅲ (UQCRC2), and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) were determined by Western blot. Mitochondria co-localizations with LC3 and lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2), syntaxin 17 (STX17) co-localizations with LC3, LAMP2, SNAP29, and VAMP8, as well as the SNAP29 co-localizations with VAMP8, were measured by immunofluorescence. To assess mitophagic flux in vivo , colchicine or saline was injected intraperitoneally 3 days before exercise, and the protein expression of mitochondrial LC3-Ⅱ was detected by Western blot. Results: After downhill running, mitochondrial structure appeared to be abnormal and contained autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes. The expression levels of CTSD, V-ATPase, and mitochondrial LC3, as well as the co-localizations of STX17 with LC3 and SNAP29 were significantly higher, whereas the expression levels of mitochondrial NDUFB8, UQCRC2, and LAMP2, along with the co-localizations of STX17 with LAMP2 and VAMP8 were significantly lower than those in the control group. Specifically, mitochondrial LC3-Ⅱ flux was significantly lower following downhill running. Conclusions: A bout of downhill running may block mitophagic flux by impairing mitophagosome-lysosome fusion, which is accompanied by increased recruitment of STX17 and SNAP29 to autophagosome and reduced co-localizations of STX17 and SNAP29 with lysosomal VAMP8.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to examine whether individuals engaging in high-load resistance training (RT) make any exercise modifications during the first trimester of pregnancy, and describe pelvic floor health, fertility history, and obstetrical characteristics. Methods: Individuals &lt;20 weeks’ gestation who regularly engaged in RT during the first trimester were recruited and completed surveys related to preconception and first trimester pelvic health, fertility, menstrual health, relative energy deficiency in sport, and exercise behaviors. Training logs from three months preconception, until 12 weeks of gestation were obtained from a subset of individuals. Results: 359 participants, mean age 32.3 years (+/- 3.6 years), completed surveys. From preconception to the first trimester, the frequency of training decreased (4.8 days +/- 1.0 days pre-pregnancy vs 4.0 +/-1.3 days in first trimester, t= 11.45, p&lt;0.01). Most individuals continued Olympic weightlifting (n=127/159, 80%) and core exercises (n=214/234, 92%), with over half increased or maintained the load of RT (n=126/203, 62%). Fatigue and nausea reportedly impacted exercise behaviour in 77% of participants. Rates of previous miscarriage were similar to the general population. Only 15% of participants were given counselling on exercise through miscarriage (10/68 participants). Ten individuals (3%) reported a miscarriage during enrolment in the current study. Pelvic floor complaints during exercise reduced significantly from preconception to trimester one, irrespective of whether training load was reduced or maintained. Forty-one athletes provided preconception and pregnancy training logs. In this subset of athletes, their working load was maintained from preconception across the first trimester at &gt;75% of estimated one-repetition maximums. Conclusions: Continued participation of RT in the first trimester was well tolerated by those participating in RT preconception.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Single-joint knee extension (KE) and multi-joint leg press (LP) are commonly used exercises to train the quadriceps femoris (QF), the largest muscle group in humans. However, their comparative effectiveness for inducing QF hypertrophy remains unclear. Furthermore, the specific muscles hypertrophied by LP are not well characterized. This study compared the hypertrophic effects of KE and LP on the QF and other lower-limb muscles. Methods: Seventeen untrained adults performed KE with one leg and LP with the contralateral leg at 70% of one-repetition maximum, 10 reps/set, 5 sets/session, 2 sessions/week for 12 weeks. MRI was used to assess pre- and post-training muscle volumes of 17 individual muscles, including the four QF heads, gluteus muscles, hamstrings, and adductors. Results: Muscle volumes of the individual and whole QF significantly increased in both conditions ( P ≤ 0.026), except for the rectus femoris in the LP condition ( P = 0.379). Rectus femoris volume gains were greater for KE than LP (+13.2% vs. +1.1%, P ≤ 0.001), but gains in the vasti muscles (+5.0–7.2% vs. +4.4–6.2%) and whole QF (+7.1% vs. +4.9%) were comparable between conditions ( P ≥ 0.319). LP, but not KE, increased volumes of the gluteus maximus (+15.4%) and the adductor magnus (+6.2%) ( P ≤ 0.001). A follow-up experiment using surface electromyography showed that muscle excitation patterns during KE and LP generally mirrored the between-condition hypertrophic differences and similarities observed after the training intervention. Conclusions: LP induces significant hypertrophy in the gluteus maximus and adductor magnus while producing similar vasti and overall QF growth as KE, indicating that LP is a highly time-efficient exercise. However, KE is essential for effectively targeting the rectus femoris, which may have clinical relevance given its high susceptibility to strain injuries.",

    "Abstract": "<ns3:p> Objective Physiologic gingival pigmentation may negatively impact smile esthetics, particularly in individuals with high smile lines. This randomized clinical trial aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of three minimally invasive depigmentation techniques: microneedling with Triphala Curna, microneedling with vitamin C, and 445-nm diode laser ablation. Materials and Methods Eighteen systemically healthy patients with physiologic gingival pigmentation were enrolled and allocated into three groups (n = 6 each) via block randomization. Group 1 received microneedling followed by topical Triphala Curna application; Group 2 received microneedling with vitamin C; and Group 3 underwent diode laser depigmentation at a wavelength of 445 nm. In Groups 1 and 2, the procedure was repeated after two weeks. Clinical assessments were performed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months for gingival pigmentation (Peeran Index), gingival thickness, and patient satisfaction (VAS scores). Statistical analysis included paired and independent t tests, chi-square tests, and descriptive statistics, with significance set at <ns3:italic>p</ns3:italic> &lt; 0.05. Results All the groups showed progressive clinical improvement. Complete depigmentation (grade 0) at 6 months was observed in 66.7% of patients in the Triphala group, 50.0% in the vitamin C group, and 33.3% in the laser group. Gingival thickness increased significantly in all groups, with the greatest increase observed in the Triphala group (from 1.10 ± 0.36 mm to 1.95 ± 0.41 mm, <ns3:italic>p</ns3:italic> &lt; 0.001). Patient satisfaction also improved across all groups, with Triphala receiving the highest mean VAS score. No adverse events or pigmentation relapses were reported during study period. Conclusion Microneedling-assisted gingival depigmentation using Triphala Curna demonstrated the most favourable clinical and esthetic outcomes among the tested modalities. Results of vitamin C treatment were comparable to those of diode laser therapy, suggesting that herbal therapies combined with microneedling can serve as viable, biologically compatible alternatives to conventional laser techniques.

    "Abstract": "Geriatric fragility fractures of the pelvic ring are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. While there is ongoing debate regarding the role of operative treatment in this patient population, the development of percutaneous operative techniques has resulted in an increase in surgical stabilization for fragility fractures of the pelvic ring. There remains a lack of consensus on which patients would benefit from operative treatment for fragility fractures of the pelvic ring. Failure to mobilize has been used as an indication for surgery. However, this results in delayed treatment decision making. The aim of this study is to determine which patient and injury factors are associated with failure of early mobilization in geriatric patients with a fragility fracture of the pelvic ring. We performed a retrospective cohort study assessing patients over the age of 60 years with a fragility fracture of the pelvic ring between July 2022 – June 2024. Patients with a fall from standing height who received nonoperative treatment were included. Patient and injury factors were collected including age, sex, pre-injury ambulatory status, fracture severity and sarcopenia. Sarcopenia was measured using a validated technique calculating the ‘Total Psoas Area’ to L3 vertebral body ratio (TPA/L3) (Figure 1) on CT. The primary outcome was failure to stand, with or without assistive devices, by post-injury day three. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the association between patient and injury variables with failure to stand. The diagnostic accuracy of predictive variables was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis. Fifty-eight patients with a fragility fracture of a pelvic ring were included for analysis. The median age was 86 (IQR 78–90) and 78% (n=45) were female sex. Fifty-two percent (n=30) of patients failed to stand by day three post-injury. Multivariable logistic regression modelling was performed evaluating age, sex, Beckman pelvic ring fracture classification, sarcopenia and pre-injury ambulatory status. Sarcopenia was the only variable that was significantly associated with failure to stand (p = 0.001). Assessing the diagnostic accuracy of sarcopenia in predicting failure to stand, the area under the area under the ROC curve was 0.738, indicating moderate accuracy (Figure 2). The results from this study demonstrate sarcopenia, measured using the TPA/L3 method, is strongly associated with failure to stand at post injury day three following a fragility fracture of the pelvic ring. This measure can be used as part of a risk stratification tool and allow for identification of patients who would potentially benefit from operative treatment. Further research is required to identify a threshold value for sarcopenia at which surgical intervention should be considered. For any figures or tables, please contact authors directly.",

    "Abstract": "To evaluate early outcomes following OI for transtibial amputees with significant socket issues, focusing on functional improvements, implant survival and complications. The study involves the analysis of prospectively collected data from the Montreal Osteointegration (OI) Clinic's Redcap database between March 2019 and April 2025. All provided informed consent and IRB authorization was given. The study includes patients with a minimum of six months of follow-up and involves data collection on various clinical parameters, including complications, and functional tests (2MWT, 6MWT, Prosthetic use score, ICL, AMPPRO, L -test and TUG). There were 22 patients (23 implantations) all with custom designed implants. One patient with bilateral below knee amputation got OI in the same setting. The follow-up averaged 2.9 years (0.5–5.6 yrs). Minor intraoperative fractures occurred in 5 (22%) during implant insertion. Only one needed fixation with 1 cerclage wire. Postoperative infections were classified according to the Al Muderis grading system. Eleven patients (50%) developed at least one infection. Nine were Grade 1A infections, one patient a Grade 2A, and another one was Grade 2B. Additionally, one patient with congenital insensitivity to pain, who had undergone bilateral tibial OI, sustained bilateral Charcot's tibial plateau fractures at 1 year, which were successfully managed with TKA. No OI implants failed, required revision or led to chronic osteomyelitis. No other complication or additional surgery were recorded. Functional tests were available for 18 pts at 1 year and 13 at 2 yrs. The 2MWT mean score improved from 118.5m pre-OI to 150.2m at 1-year (p = 0.038) and from 126.4m pre-OI to 145.7m (p = 0.033) at 2 yrs. Similarly, the 6MWT improvement with the mean distance going from 291.6m pre-OI to 435m at the 1 yr (p = 0.012) and from 302.2m pre-OI to 423.9m (p = 0.036) at 2 yrs. The AMPPRO remained of similar values at 1 yr with a mean scores of 43.3 and 44.5 (p = 0.13). However, for the 2 yrs group, there was significant improvement from a mean of 43 pre-OI to 44.4 (p = 0.044). The TUG Test showed no significant improvements at either the 1-year or 2-year. The mean score was 8.6 pre-OI and 9.32 at 1 year (p = 0.53), while at 2 years, it went from 10 pre-OI to 10.4 (p = 0.7). We found no difference between the 1-year and 2-year the functional tests results. Our study highlights osseointegration as an effective and advantageous option for transtibial amputees who have struggled with socket prostheses. The procedure significantly improved functional outcomes, and complications were minor and manageable without implant revision or removal. Although infections were frequent, they remained manageable. This research provides valuable insights into the short-term sustainability and effectiveness of osseointegration for transtibial amputees.",

    "Abstract": "The primary objective of this survey was to determine the prevalence of dedicated social workers or health care professionals otherwise dedicated to the task of assisting patients with non-physical aspects of their recovery in outpatient fracture clinics. Secondary objectives included: determining what services social workers provide where present; understanding the perspectives of orthopaedic surgeons regarding the need for the addition of a social worker to the fracture clinic; determining the type of resources and services that orthopaedic surgeons believe social workers could provide and identifying surgeons’ perceived barriers and facilitators to this addition. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of orthopaedic trauma surgeons. The survey, a self-administered electronic questionnaire, consisted of a brief screening questionnaire followed by four main sections: Demographics and Practice Setting; Social Worker Support in Outpatient Fracture Clinic; Social Worker Assistance in Clinic; and Perceptions of Social Worker in Clinic. To ensure responses from surgeons knowledgeable about the needs of patients in the fracture clinic setting, we established the following eligibility criteria: 1) currently practicing orthopaedic surgeons, 2) treating patients with fractures as part of their practice, 3) able to complete the survey in English, and 4) willing to participate in the study by completing an electronic survey. This cross-sectional study surveyed 88 orthopaedic trauma surgeons on the potential benefits and barriers to integrating social work support into outpatient fracture clinics. While only 16% of respondents currently had dedicated social work services available at their clinic, respondents acknowledged the critical need for their services, particularly in addressing employment, psychological support, and housing crises. Surgeons expressed strong agreement that social workers could effectively address various patient needs, including assistance with intimate partner violence (88.6%), transportation (86.4%), home care (85.2%), and addictions support (81.8%). These findings underscore the potential for enhanced patient care through interdisciplinary collaboration and social work support in outpatient orthopaedic trauma settings.",

    "Abstract": "Fail chest injuries have high rate of morbidity and mortality. Patients can experience pulmonary dysfunction with chronic chest tightness, shortness of breath, and restrictive lung disease. There is some evidence that surgery may improve pulmonary function, however no high-quality study has assessed the effect of surgery on pulmonary function in the short- or long-term post injury. A previously published randomized controlled trial was conducted, comparing surgery to non-operative treatment of patients with unstable chest wall injuries. Secondary analysis of this study was conducted. Spirometry testing was conducted to assess forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume exhaled in the first second (FEV1) at 3- and 12-months post injury. The predicted FEV1 and FVC values were then calculated for each patient, which is based on the patients’ age, sex and height. A total of 86 patients had data available at 3 months and 91 at 12 months. Mean predicted FEV1 was 74.1 at 3 months and 78.0 at 12 months, while mean predicted FVC was 80.9 at 3 months and 86.6 at 12 months. There was no difference in the predicted FEV1 or FVC scores between the two groups at 3 or 12 months. Both groups improved with time. Between 3 months to 12 months, the operative group had a greater improvement in the percentage of predicted FEV1 compared to the non-operative group (improvement of 5 vs.1, p = 0.026). Regarding FVC, there was a trend towards improvement of predicted FVC in the operative group compared to the non-operative group (improvement of 7.3 vs. 3.7, p = 0.07). This randomized controlled trial demonstrates that patients with flail chest injury have a mild restrictive lung disease at 3 months, which improves by one-year post injury, but does not normalize. At 3- and 12-months post injury, patients with flail chest injuries had similar pulmonary function, with similar FEV1 and FVC, regardless of operative or non-operative management. However, the surgical group had more improvement in FEV1 compared to the non-operative group from 3 months to 12 months. Further research is needed to identify factors associated with reduced pulmonary function in this patient population, and how they can be improved.",

    "Abstract": "Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are rare and aggressive tumors that are notoriously difficult to treat as they rarely respond to conventional systemic therapies and require extensive operations. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T therapy is a novel immunotherapy where a patient's T cells are engineered to recognize and kill malignant cells based on a target antigen. CAR T cell therapy has revolutionized treatment of hematological malignancies. However, STS generally do not respond to this therapy despite expressing known CAR T target antigens. This is thought to be due to the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) characteristic of many STS, which diminishes CAR T cells infiltrating the TME, preventing CAR T mediated killing of malignant cells. Additionally, studies suggest tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) are highly abundant in STS and may be driving immune suppression in the TME. Thus, targeting TAMs may alleviate the immune suppression in the TME and enhance the efficacy of CAR T therapy in STS. The purpose of this study investigating diminishing TAMs in combination CAR T therapy in a murine model of STS. We used a previously published murine model of STS developed by our laboratory. The immune cells within this tumor model are predominantly monocyte-TAM lineage cells. This model also expresses GD2, which is a known CAR T target used in neuroblastoma and is also expressed in many STS. Thus, this provides a clinically relevant murine model of STS. We engrafted STS into wild type C57Bl/6 mice and Ccr2−/− mice, which have a deficiency in the classical monocyte recruitment pathway, which is essential for macrophages to infiltrate inflamed tissues. For CAR T therapy, we have generated a second generation CD28-CD3z mouse GD2 CAR using the 14G2a scFV currently being utilized in GD2 clinical trials. This construct contains a scFV proximal MYC tag to measure CAR cell surface expression, and a Thy1.1 cell surface receptor to measure T cell transduction efficiency. We have demonstrated that our CAR T cells display robust cytotoxicity to murine STS cells expressing GD2 in vitro. Mice bearing STS will undergo nonmyeloablative lymphodepletion with a single 200mg/kg dose of cyclophosphamide as standard part of CAR T cell therapy, followed by an intravenous delivery of GD2 CAR T cells. We monitored tumor growth using caliper measurements and assessed immune cells in murine STS using flow cytometry. Ccr2−/− mice bearing STS showed significantly smaller tumor size in comparison to C57Bl/6 mice. In assessing the TME, we found a significant reduction in the proportion of monocytes and TAMs, and an increased proportion CD3e+ and CD8+ T cells in the TME. Thus, reducing TAMs may provide an avenue to increase CAR T cell infiltration in the TME. Next, we administered CAR T cells to Ccr2−/− mice and C57Bl/6 mice. This experiment is currently ongoing. CCR2 deficiency provided both a significant reduction to TAMs and tumor size in this murine model of STS. Given the increased proportion of CD8 T cells, we believe this strategy may also improve the efficacy of CAR T therapy, which is under experimental assessment.",

    "Abstract": "Rotationplasty is a limb salvage option for musculoskeletal tumors of the lower extremity and was historically indicated for the pediatric population. Indications, however, have expanded considering the success of this procedure. The aim of this study is to evaluate functional outcomes and complications in adults undergoing rotationplasty for oncologic and non-oncologic indications. Six (2 male:4 female) adult patients undergoing rotationplasty at our institution were reviewed. Mean age was 33±17 (range 22–65) years and mean follow up was 1±0.4 years. Indications for rotationplasty included primary malignancy (n=2) and previous limb salvage attempts (n=4). One patient undergoing rotationplasty for malignancy experienced recurrence requiring hip disarticulation at 5 months. The remaining patients had a minimum one year follow up and were included in functional outcomes. Prosthetic fitting occurred at mean 4±2 months post-operatively in the 5 patients with rotationplasty at final follow up. All patients were ambulating without gait aids, and 4/5 returned to work. Four patients were functioning at a K-level 3 with their prosthesis, while one patient was functioning at a K-level 4. On examination, mean extension lag was 19±14°. Mean MSTS score was 76±30%. Post-operative complications included expanding hematoma (n=1) requiring return to the operating room and delayed wound healing (n=1). At most recent follow up, 3/5 patients reported ongoing pain, including neuropathic pain, Achilles tendonitis, and residual limb sensitivity. Rotationplasty is an effective option for limb salvage in the adult population with promising functional outcomes and should be considered in adult patients requiring resection of the knee joint.",

    "Abstract": "Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty (RSA) implant fixation is assessed by studying baseplate micromotion as dictated in ASTM F2028 standard. This standard uses homogeneous foam material as a proxy for glenoid bone, but this material approximates cancellous bone while RSA primary fixation also relies on screw engagement with the glenoid vault's cortex. As such, it is unclear whether this accurately replicates RSA fixation. Therefore, the goal of this study was to compare RSA micromotion in foam substitutes and cadaveric specimens, to assess their similarity and inform changes to ASTM F2028. Four cadaveric shoulder specimens were implanted with angled RSA baseplate components (Perform Reversed Angled Baseplate, Stryker). Identical implants were installed in four 20 PCF foam blocks (Sawbones Inc). A worst-case fixation scenario was used: four 26 mm screws, consisting of three locking with 0° angulation and an inferior compression screw with 3° angulation. Cyclic loading and micromotion testing followed ASTM F2028 (Figure 1). LVDT sensors measured shear and normal micromotion at the inferior glenosphere aspect while a constant 430N compressive load was applied and a shear load was ramped between 350N in the inferior and superior directions. The sensors were attached to the glenosphere and a fixed reference plate level with the implant-bone interface. The baseplate-glenosphere construct then underwent 45° abduction-adduction cylcing while a 750N compressive load was applied. Baseplate micromotion was remeasured after 10k and 100k cycles. Displacements are reported as the total micromotion between the maximum inferiorly and superiorly directed shear loads. Micromotions were normalized to the average uncycled foam specimen values and two-tailed T-tests were performed to compare the foam and cadaveric results. Cycling primarily increased micromotion but the increase was non-monotonic (Table 1). There were no statistically significant differences in micromotion between the foam and cadaveric specimens prior to cycling for the normal and shear directions: 72.1±34.1% (Mean Difference ± Standard Error of Difference), p = 0.095 and 38.2±20.0%, p = 0.105, respectively. After 10k cycles, the difference in normal (134.4±81.5%, p = 0.199) and shear (89.7±42.0%, p = 0.126) micromotion was not statistically significant. After 100k cycles, the difference in normal micromotion was not significant (45.9±61.5%, p = 0.585), but the difference in shear was significant (74.6±19.5%, p = 0.025). The cadaveric specimens exhibited greater normal and shear micromotion at all timepoints (range: 38%-134%), but, due to the large variance across cadaveric specimen results, the difference was only significant in shear after 100k cycles. These findings may result from the lack of cortical engagement in this worst-case (i.e. minimum screw length and angulation) screw configuration, and the reduced contact between the implant and the cadaveric glenoid due to the need to maintain subchondral bone during bone preparation. These results indicate that foam may be an efficacious surrogate for worst-case fixation scenarios where screws may not be effectively engaging with dense cortical bone. However, further study is needed to determine the efficacy of foam as a bone surrogate in cases where screw lengths and angulation are appropriately matched to the specific anatomy to achieve cortical bone engagement.

    "Abstract": "Cam morphology of the hip may predispose to Femoroacetabular Impingement (FAI) and osteoarthritis (OA). Understanding the biological and functional changes in FAI may provide insight into the early stages of OA and allow for the development of a predictive biomarker. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) T1ρ mapping gives information on proteoglycan content in hyaline cartilage, while Positron Emission Tomography (PET) allows for functional imaging of bone turnover. In this study, Positron Emission Tomography and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET-MRI) were performed simultaneously to analyze bone and cartilage in hips with cam impingement and controls. 3T PET-MRI was used to study two groups: symptomatic cam morphology (n = 24), and healthy controls (n = 18). MRI T1ρ maps were acquired as measures of cartilage proteoglycan content, and 18F-NaF-PET Standard Uptake Values (SUVs) were acquired as measures of bone turnover in the acetabulum and femoral head-neck junction (FHNJ). Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) were collected using Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (HOOS), EQ-5D-5L, and the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-33). Kruskal–Wallis, pairwise Wilcoxon tests, and Spearman correlations were used to compare measures between groups. For the symptomatic group, significant positive correlations were observed between T1ρ anterior medial and full anterior cartilage with maximum SUV in several regions of acetabulum and FHNJ, although not strong (−0.6 Increased T1ρ in the symptomatic group indicates early stages of cartilage degeneration in FAI patients. Increased SUV in the symptomatic group indicates active bone remodeling occurring in symptomatic presentations of FAI. The positive correlation between T1ρ and SUV suggest an association of cartilage degeneration and bone remodeling in the symptomatic group. Both measures are associated with worsening pain and quality of life, as demonstrated through the PROMs results. PET-MRI allows simultaneous analysis of bone and cartilage and may be a useful tool for FAI and OA research.",

    "Abstract": "Aims Electrochemical properties of synovial fluid are variable among patients and can lead to implant corrosion, negatively impacting their longevity. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationships between electrochemical properties of synovial fluid of knee osteoarthritic (OA) patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and their clinical and demographic data. Methods Knee OA patients undergoing TKA were enrolled in this study, and samples of their synovial fluid were collected during surgery and immediately injected into a three-electrode electrochemical cell to measure their electrochemical properties, including open circuit potential, polarization resistance, and cathodic current density. Synovial fluid samples from 43 patients were collected (25 females; mean age 69.9 years (SD 7.6); mean BMI 27.6 kg/m 2 (SD 5.2)). Clinical evaluation of the patients was conducted preoperatively to assess the disease severity, the inflammation in the knee joint, and patient-reported outcomes. A correlation analysis was performed to study the relationship between the electrochemical parameters of the synovial fluid and demographic and clinical data of the patients. Results Significant correlations were found between disease severity and both the polarization resistance and the cathodic current density, between WOMAC stiffness scores and polarization resistance, and between KSS knee scores and both open circuit potential and cathodic current density. Finally, patients with a history of oxygen-reducing medical conditions had larger open circuit potential than patients without this kind of medical history. Conclusion For the first time, correlations between patients’ characteristics clinical and an in vivo electrochemical measurement have been obtained. The results showed that patients with more severe disease and more symptoms had less corrosive synovial fluid. Moreover, this study showed lower corrosive properties of synovial fluid in patients with a history of oxygen-reducing medical conditions, highlighting the critical role of oxygen in corrosion.

    "Abstract": "Aims The aims of this study are to identify the causes and independent risk factors for failure following revision total hip arthroplasty (RTHA). Methods We conducted a retrospective multicentre cohort study involving 963 patients who underwent RTHA between January 2016 and December 2021 across three French university hospitals, with a minimum follow-up of two years. Data collected included demographic details, revision rank (R1= first revision, R 2= second revision, R ≥ 3=third or subsequent revision), surgical variables, complications, reoperations, re-revisions, and mortality. RTHA failure was defined as any reoperation or re-revision. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine independent risk factors for failure. Results The mean patient age was 72 years (14 to 104), with 55% of patients being female. The most common indications for RTHA were aseptic loosening (35.6%), periprosthetic fracture (32.0%), periprosthetic joint infection (PJI; 15.2%), and dislocation (5.7%). Failure occurred in 135 patients (14.0%), most frequently due to PJI (53%), of which 61% were new infections. Among patients revised for dislocation, recurrent instability accounted for 43.7% of failures. Most failures (70%) occurred within one year of revision. Independent risk factors included age ≥ 75 years (odds ratio (OR) 0.61), revision rank ≥ 3 (OR 1.96), PJI (OR 2.0), dislocation (OR 2.86), use of revision (OR 2.38), and constrained acetabular cups (OR 5.38). Conclusion Aseptic loosening remains the leading indication for revision surgery, while PJI is the principal cause of failure following RTHA, both as a new infection and as iterative failure. Recurrent dislocation continues to pose a complex challenge despite modern implant strategies, underscoring the need for meticulous surgical planning in high-risk patients.

    "Abstract": "The vaginal microbiota is associated with the health of women and newborns alike. Despite its comparatively simple composition relative to other human microbiota systems, the mechanisms underpinning the dynamics and stability of vaginal microbial communities remain elusive. A crucial, yet so far underexplored, aspect of vaginal microbiota ecology is the role played by nutritional resources. Glycogen and its derivatives, produced by vaginal epithelia, are accessible to all bacterial constituents of the microbiota. Concurrently, free sialic acid and fucose offer supplementary nutritional resources to bacterial strains capable of cleaving them from glycans, which are structurally integral to mucus. Notably, bacteria adept at sialic acid exploitation are often correlated with adverse clinical outcomes and are frequently implicated in bacterial vaginosis (BV). In this study, we introduce a novel mathematical model tailored to human vaginal microbiota dynamics to explore the interactions between bacteria and their respective nutritional landscape. Our resource-based model examines the impact of the relative availability of glycogen derivatives (accessible to all bacterial species) and sialic acid (exclusive to some BV-associated bacteria) on the composition of the vaginal microbiota. Our findings elucidate that the success of BV-associated bacteria is intricately linked to their exclusive access to specific nutritional resources. This private access fortifies communities dominated by BV-associated bacteria, rendering them resilient to compositional transitions. We empirically corroborate our model prediction with longitudinal clinical data on microbiota composition and previously unpublished metabolomic profiles obtained from a North American cohort. The insights gleaned from this study shed light on potential pathways for BV prevention and treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Retinal detachment (RD) is a sight-threatening emergency requiring urgent intervention to prevent permanent vision loss. While both environmental and genetic risk factors contribute to RD, its complete genetic architecture remains unknown. Here, we performed the largest whole genome sequencing-based case-control study in RD to date, including data from 7,276 RD cases and 236,741 controls in the UK Biobank. Through variant- and gene-level association analyses, we identified VSX2 as a genetic determinant of RD risk while confirming established associations including FAT3 , RDH5 , and COL2A1 . Gene-level collapsing analysis revealed that rare heterozygous missense variants in VSX2 confer a 2.8-fold increased risk of RD (p = 2.4x10 -10 ; odds ratio (OR) = 2.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): [2.1, 3.7]). One missense variant in this gene, p.Glu218Asp, demonstrated a particularly strong effect size (p = 9.3x10 -10 ; OR = 5.9; 95% CI: [3.7, 9.4]). Replication analyses in two additional cohorts, totaling 1,331 cases and 52,355 controls strengthened both the gene- and variant-level associations even further (p = 1.4x10 -10 and 1.1x10 -11 , respectively). Other contributory heterozygous variants included previously reported pathogenic homozygous variants for anophthalmia and microphthalmia. These findings thus reveal a previously unknown gene dosage curve for VSX2, where homozygous mutations cause severe developmental eye disorders and heterozygous mutations cause adult-onset retinal detachment. Extending this observation, we found a significant enrichment for other known recessive Mendelian eye disease genes among nominally significant (p &lt; 0.05) genes associated with RD in the collapsing analysis. This work provides a compelling example of how heterozygous variants in recessive disease genes can be associated with less severe clinical phenotypes.",

    "Abstract": "Immunocompromised girls, including girls living with HIV, face significantly increased risk for HPV-linked cervical cancer and require a differentiated human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination schedule. While World Health Organization (WHO) vaccination guidelines exist, recommending immunocompromised individuals receive at least two, if possible three doses of HPV vaccine, little is known about how country health programs implement these recommendations. This study examines HPV vaccination policies, delivery strategies, barriers, and enablers for immunocompromised girls in Eswatini, Malawi, and Uganda—countries with a high burden of HIV and cervical cancer. A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted through key informant interviews and focus group discussions with stakeholders from ministries of health, implementing partners, and health workers. A desk review of relevant policy documents was also conducted. Data were analyzed thematically to identify common and country-specific themes. All three countries follow the WHO's recommendation for a two-dose HPV vaccine schedule for immunocompromised girls. However, none have fully documented or consistently implemented policies or delivery strategies to reach immunocompromised girls with additional HPV vaccination doses. Stakeholder awareness of dosing schedules and strategies to vaccinate immunocompromised girls was limited and inconsistent, though higher in Eswatini than in Malawi or Uganda. Promising strategies were identified across the three countries, including use of Teen Clubs and adolescent HIV clinics to deliver HPV vaccines. Barriers included stigma, limited cold chain infrastructure, unclear operational policies, and weak data systems. Enablers included trusted health provider relationships, peer mentorship, and community awareness of cervical cancer risks. Improving HPV vaccine delivery for immunocompromised girls, including girls living with HIV, will require documenting and disseminating clear policies, integrating vaccination into HIV and adolescent health services, scaling successful strategies, and strengthening data systems to monitor coverage. Tailored, stigma-sensitive strategies are essential to ensure equitable cervical cancer prevention for immunocompromised adolescents in high HIV-burden settings.",

    "Abstract": "Background Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are associated with the prognosis of various types of adult cancers. However, the expressions and prognosis of BMPs in pediatric neuroblastoma remain unclear. Methods Six publicly available neuroblastoma cohorts were downloaded for bioinformatics analysis. The prognosis of BMPs in neuroblastoma was determined using cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results Our study revealed that, compared to other BMP family members, BMP1, BMP7 and BMP8B were highly expressed in neuroblastoma. However, only BMP7 was associated with the prognosis of neuroblastoma in all six neuroblastoma cohorts. Higher BMP7 expression was associated with the shorted event free survival and overall survival of neuroblastoma. The prognosis of BMP7 in neuroblastoma was independent of age and MYCN amplification. The expressions of BMP7 were higher in neuroblastoma patients with MYCN amplification or age ≥ 18months or in stage 4 neuroblastoma. Moreover, higher BMP7 was associated with the shorted event free survival and overall survival of MYCN amplified or stage 4 neuroblastoma. At last, we found that breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) was correlated with BMP7 expression. However, in contrast with the suppressor role of BRMS1 in adult cancers, BRMS1 was significantly associated with the unfavorable clinical outcomes of neuroblastoma. Overall, our analysis the demonstrated correlations between BMPs and clinical features of neuroblastoma and provided unique therapeutic targets for neuroblastoma treatments. Conclusions BMP7 was a prognostic maker of neuroblastoma.",

    "Abstract": "By influencing gene expression and contributing to epigenetic modifications, Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) modification significantly affects cellular pathways. It plays an important role in complex regulatory networks and gene expression. Moreover, 5hmC modifications are linked to a variety of human diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular conditions. However, experimental methods to identify RNA 5hmC modifications, such as chromatography and Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification, are costly and time-consuming. So, computational methods are necessary to predict these modifications. In this study, several feature descriptors were analyzed and compared to finalize the best ones. Different deep-learning models were explored to design the proposed model architecture. Neighbourhood analysis was conducted on the dataset to provide insights into a deeper understanding of RNA 5hmC modifications. The proposed model, InTrans-RNA5hmC, is a dual-branch deep learning model that has two branches: the Inception branch and the Transformer branch. Word embeddings having the contextual information and language model embeddings from the RiboNucleic Acid Language Model (RiNALMo) were used as the finalized feature descriptors. InTrans-RNA5hmC outperformed existing SOTA methods, achieving 0.97 sensitivity, 0.985 balanced accuracy, and 0.985 F1 score on the Independent test set.",

    "Abstract": "This research explores the connection between religious culture and carbon emissions through the lens of informal institutions, offering valuable insights into the shift to a green economy in China. The research sample comprises listed enterprises from 2010–2020 to investigate the influence of indigenous religious culture, represented by Buddhism and Taoism, on the corporate carbon footprint. The results reveal that religious culture has a notable inhibitory effect on corporate carbon outputs. Through a suite of robustness checks, the findings remain in line with the benchmark results. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the effect of religious culture on corporate carbon emissions is more noticeable in economically thriving areas, state-owned companies, polluting-intensive companies, capital-intensive companies, and high-tech companies. Mechanistic tests suggest that religious culture mainly reduces corporate carbon emissions through three pathways: promoting corporate social responsibility, alleviating corporate financing constraints, and increasing corporate green innovation. Research has shown that both formal institutions and foreign cultural impacts weaken the beneficial impact of indigenous religious culture on corporate carbon reduction but do not eliminate its effect. This study provides practical guidelines and theoretical references for enterprises and policy-makers in addressing climate change and achieving sustainable development.",

    "Abstract": "African swine fever (ASF) has become a global pandemic, affecting nearly 2 million pigs since 2022 alone and causing significant disruption to food security and trade. The Dominican Republic (DR) has been affected by ASF since 2021. Veterinarians are key first responders in animal health emergencies and at risk for negative impacts from prolonged emergency response. We used mixed methods and network analysis to characterize the mental and social impacts of ASF on 29 DR swine veterinarians. All 29 veterinarians were involved with the ASF response through field-based or non-field-based roles. Responses were gathered via a questionnaire and analyzed using network analysis. Preliminary quantitative results were explored further through qualitative focus group interviews. Veterinarians experienced high levels of anger and hopelessness from the ASF epidemic, which were centrally located variables in the network. They were associated with a perceived lack of communication, trust, and transparency between government authorities, veterinarians, and farmers. The impact that animal diseases have on the mental health of veterinarians is often neglected. As animal, human, and zoonotic diseases, such as ASF and avian influenza, continue to emerge and expand, these results bring attention to the need for considering actions to prevent and mitigate their impact on the mental health of first responders and, ultimately, improve the effectiveness of the response.",

    "Abstract": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging coronavirus that can cause zoonotic disease in humans with lethal severe viral pneumonia. Dromedary camels are the source of zoonotic infection. As of November 2025, MERS-CoV has resulted in a total of 2630 reported cases, 37% of these being fatal. The number of reported human cases has been on a decreasing trend since 2016 and reached a nadir during the COVID-19 pandemic. The reason for the reduction of cases is unclear and may be multifactorial. We hypothesized that mutations accumulating in the virus spike protein may have reduced zoonotic potential. Here, we investigate the impact of recently emerged virus spike-protein mutations on virus replication competence using pseudoviruses and replication-competent recombinant viruses. We found that virus spike variants detected in 2019 and some from 2023 show a reduced cell entry, lower viral replication and reduced fitness in human primary alveolar epithelial cells and multiple cell lines. All the MERS-CoV spikes tested showed a cell-entry pathway preference via the cell-surface TMPRSS2 route. Mechanistically, we showed the V530A mutation in the 2019 spike sequence had a reduced human DPP4 binding phenotype. Our data highlighted MERS-CoV spike mutations can modulate viral fitness in human cells and provide new insights to understand recent MERS epidemiology.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives Antiphosphatidylserine/prothrombin (aPS/PT) antibodies are promising non-criteria aPLs associated with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) manifestations. Their influence on long-term outcomes and damage remains uncertain. To assess aPS/PT antibodies association with accrual damage and severe APS disease phenotypes, focusing on their potential for risk stratification. Methods This single-centre cohort study involved 163 patients who fulfilled the 2023 ACR/EULAR APS criteria. IgG/IgM aPS/PT, aCL, and anti-β2GPI antibodies were measured by commercial ELISA. Lupus anticoagulant (LA) was detected in accordance with the ISTH-SSC recommendation. Clinical data covered macrovascular, microvascular, obstetric, and hematologic manifestations. Damage was assessed using DIAPS. Results aPS/PT IgG and IgM were positive in 46.0 % and 65.6 %, respectively. aPS/PT IgG positivity was linked to microvascular involvement (58.7 % vs. 34.1 %, p=0.002), obstetric APS (57.4 % vs. 24.6 %, p&lt;0.0001), valvular disease (17.3 % vs. 4.6 %, p=0.008), and thrombocytopenia (37.3 % vs. 12.5 %, p&lt;0.0001). aPS/PT IgM positivity was also associated with microvascular APS (p=0.006), obstetric morbidity (p=0.02), and thrombocytopenia (p=0.01). In multivariable analysis, quadruple aPL positivity (LA + aCL + anti-β2GPI + aPS/PT) was independently linked to damage (OR 4.3, 95 % CI 1.3–14.5; p=0.02), with no other factors remaining significant. Conclusions Both IgG and IgM aPS/PT antibodies are associated with severe APS features, including microvascular and obstetric issues, as well as overall organ damage. Adding aPS/PT to standard aPL tests finds a subgroup of quadruple-positive APS patients at higher risk of damage. These results could help guide personalized APS management.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The process usually known as conversion involves a number of descriptive levels that exceed what is usual in word-formation: orthographical, phonological, morphological, syntactic, and semantic requirements give shape to a profile that, precisely because of the varied preconditions at play, may match or overlap to some extent the result of other processes, or occur in words of a different kind. As a result, the literature has often discussed the limits of conversion and/or has presented conversion as a process that may apply in full or partially, according to how many and which of the preconditions are met. This paper presents and discusses the cases that are not central or major conversion in English (albeit with projections to other languages), and argues the extent to which each of the neighbouring profiles can be viewed as word-formation or not. The discussion leads to dissimilar standpoints, whereby the words formed by conversion can be viewed as a clear-cut group, or a group with blurred boundaries according to the theoretical positions taken in various regards. The inherent difficulty of this outcome applies in English, but also in languages that have their own specific preconditions (and their repercussions), and still are burdened with the descriptive difficulties of English.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives About 10–15 % of small for gestational age (SGA) children have persistent short stature (SGA-SS) and may benefit from growth hormone therapy. Customized percentiles that consider maternal height and weight, among other factors, appear to more accurately identify pathologically small newborns at higher risk of perinatal morbidity. We aim to determine whether the consideration of maternal height and weight in definition of SGA has an impact on the frequency of SGA-SS diagnosis and potential therapy. Methods Birth data of 1321 infants with a gestational age of ≥30 weeks of gestation were analyzed using both conventional percentiles and customized birth weight percentiles, the latter incorporating maternal height and weight. Growth data at 2 and 4 years of age were analyzed for the presence of persistent short stature (SGA-SS) in infants born SGA. Results Using the conventional birth weight percentiles, 129 (9.8 %) newborns are classified as SGA compared to 158 (11.9 %) using the customized percentiles. Forty-one infants of high-weight mothers were identified using only the customized classification. Twelve infants born to low-weight mothers were identified by conventional classification only. At 2 and 4 years of age, seven children had persistent short stature. The diagnosis of SGA-SS differed in only one case between the conventional and customized birth weight percentiles. Conclusions Customized percentiles classify more children as SGA based on their birth weight but do not appear to identify more children with postnatal growth failure than do conventional percentiles.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Even if grammar knowledge makes the learning of foreign languages easier, not everybody enjoys learning grammar. Indeed, learning the grammar of a foreign language can be influenced by various factors, which may either facilitate or hinder the process. This paper addresses one of such factors, i. e. the comprehensibility of grammar writing. For foreign language learners, grammatical comprehensibility entails that rules are presented in an accessible manner, that the register used appropriately bridges expert and non-expert communication, and that the level of complexity aligns with the reading proficiency of non-native speakers. This paper presents a knowledge transfer project that explores how writing strategies from plain language ( Einfache Sprache ) can be applied to grammar instruction for learners of German as a foreign/second language. It offers and discusses examples of how elements of plain language can be integrated into digital grammar modules, tailored to learners with varying levels of language proficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study examines the challenges involved in automatically identifying disinformation about abortion on Twitter. We collected 166,180 tweets posted on X (January–December 2022) about the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade to train large language models (LLMs) and machine learning systems to recognize disinformation about abortion. For this purpose, we created a pilot corpus of 8,309 tweets. Surprisingly, only 0.08 % of the pilot corpus contained medical disinformation. We thus questioned whether the planned machine learning could be carried out, given that semantic ambiguity regarding what is fake in the abortion debate poses significant hurdles. We observed that tweets expressing extreme viewpoints were often labelled as “fake”, highlighting the subjective nature of such categorizations. These findings, strongly influenced by personal ideological views on the topic in question, emphasize the complexity of using LLMs and machine learning systems to navigate emotionally charged topics. They also emphasize the importance of considering different perspectives to reduce bias in analyses, advise caution against relying solely on these technologies, and warn of the problems of potential bias and “cherry-picking” in data interpretation, especially when researching social media debates which are full of implicit content, presuppositions, and implicatures, as well as fallacious argumentation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study examines the polysemy of the sweeping away gesture and its integration with speech using a Cognitive Grammar framework. While previous research has documented the embodied origins and multiple senses of this kind of gesture, two gaps remain: a unified model of its cognitive mechanisms and a detailed Cognitive Grammar analysis of its symbolic integration patterns. Analyzing instances from debates, we identify three multimodal constructions: Extension, Completion, and Negation. We demonstrate that the semantic expansion across these constructions is not arbitrary but motivated by specific cognitive operations: the shift from Extension to Completion constructions stems from trajector prominence shifts within the same profiled relationship, while Negation emerges through metaphorical mapping. Furthermore, each construction exhibits distinct integration patterns: elaboration (Extension), extension (Completion), and complementation (Negation). By detailing these specific form-meaning pairings, this study demonstrates Cognitive Grammar’s robust capacity for modeling gestural polysemy within a unified framework. The analysis further reveals a functional continuum from compositional to pragmatic uses, motivating the development of more dynamic analytical models. Ultimately, by explaining the systematic cognitive mechanisms of gesture-speech integration, this work advances a granular understanding of language as an embodied, multimodal phenomenon.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic quickly led to the introduction of COVID-19 public health signage in many locations around the world. However, the language practices of these signs remain under-examined even years after the emergence of COVID-19. This study examines 39 unique authoritative COVID-19 public health signs collected in South Korea which contain English. We find that the use of English within signage intended for a domestic Korean audience differs radically from the use of English intended for a foreign audience within Korea. Within signage intended for a Korean audience, we find that English can convey information within the English text itself, can serve a design purpose reinforcing the meaning of a sign, and be a means of Korean-English punning. Within signage intended for a foreign audience, English was used alongside Chinese and Japanese as part of a general multilingual communication strategy, while widely differing language practices were used within certain ‘foreign places’ within Korea. We also identify ‘pseudo-bilingual signage’ that can limit the effectiveness of public health signage, and highlight the potential of multilingual public health communication for purportedly monolingual majority communities. This study should be of interest to scholars of world Englishes and public-health communication.",

Focusing on Maaya’s linguistic discourse, visual self-presentation, and consumer-driven digital performance, the study investigates how virtual influencers participate in shaping cultural norms, gendered identities, and algorithmically conditioned desire. Design/methodology/approach A purposive Instagram dataset was analyzed through critical discourse analysis and semiotic reading, integrating posthumanism, postcolonial feminism, and panoptic theory to examine Maaya’s digital identity construction. Findings Maaya’s gendered language, global aesthetics and consumer branding reflect strategic alignment with influencer culture, while followers’ comments and algorithmic visibility reveal a hybrid digital identity shaped by cultural detachment, surveillance logics and market-driven aspiration. Practical implicationsDigital media practitioners, marketers and researchers are offered guidance on analyzing virtual influencers in emerging markets. The study highlights how algorithmic visibility, linguistic choices and visual aesthetics shape audience perception, branding decisions and identity construction within South Asia’s digital economy. Social implicationsThe study shows how virtual influencers shape and contest Pakistan’s gender, modernity, and consumer culture narratives. Originality/valueThis is the first academic study that contributes to the growing scholarship on synthetic identities by illustrating how virtual influencers simultaneously embody globalized aesthetics and negotiate localized socio-cultural boundaries.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose The adoption and use of generative AI (GAI) have grown rapidly among young adults around the world. Grounded in technology adoption and attitude-behavior theories, this study investigates how the perceived valence of generative AI on social media shapes young adults’ intentions to use generative AI across four societies while also examining the mediating roles of perceived usefulness and general attitudes. Methodology Cross-national surveys were conducted among individuals aged 18–24 across four societies: Austria, Serbia, Indonesia, and Hong Kong, China ( N = 2,144). Findings A moderated mediation analysis revealed that perceived usefulness and positive attitudes toward generative AI significantly mediated the relationship between perceived valence and use intention, aligning with theoretical expectations. However, the direct relationship between perceived valence and use intention was significant only in Indonesia and Hong Kong, and not in Austria and Serbia. Furthermore, the influence of perceived valence on positive attitudes was stronger in the two Asian societies compared to the European ones. Practical/social implications These findings underscore the potentially critical role of cultural context in shaping young people’s perceptions and adoption of GAI. The results have important implications for the development and promotion of GAI technologies across different societal and cultural settings. Originality/value The cross-national study examines societies that have been under-researched in the literature on GAI attitudes and adoption.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The contribution of cocoa to the economies of countries, especially producing countries cannot be understated. However, volatility in the prices of commodities affect all stakeholders in the production value chain as it affects planning, policy implementation and mitigation of risks. Thus, it is very crucial to be able to forecast cocoa prices with a high degree of certainty. Hence, this study modeled cocoa prices in Ghana using 15 machine learning models and their corresponding decomposition based hybrid models. The machine learning models incorporated input variables, including interest rates, inflation rates and crude oil prices. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) techniques were applied to the data and the 15 models were further used to model the data, thus obtaining 30 hybrid models. The results of the study revealed that among the 15 machine learning models, quantile random forest model was the best for the data set. Generally, EEMD hybrid models performed better than the VMD based models, with EEMD-generalized additive model with splines being the best hybrid model. The findings show that interest rates play a major role in the prediction of cocoa prices in Ghana. This was closely followed by crude oil prices. Hence, it is recommended that policies that would reflect favorable interest rates and crude oil prices are implemented by policy makers.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The present study investigates the linguistic mechanisms underlying textual narratives that evoke horror in the Backrooms discourse. Originating on 4chan (an anonymous image-based internet forum) in 2019 and rapidly evolving through participatory storytelling, the Backrooms discourse depicts unsettling urban spaces marked by shifting architectural forms and ambiguous spatial configurations. Drawing on cognitive linguistic frameworks, including frame semantics and Cognitive Grammar, this exploratory analysis examines how language creates unease by systematically disrupting prototypical schemas. A corpus of 5,676 words from 10 Backrooms descriptions (Levels 0–9) is analyzed using an annotation scheme that identifies semantic incongruities, agentless constructions, and non-prototypical framing structures. The findings reveal that textual horror is generated by contradictions in spatial frames, dehumanization via passivation, and deliberate hedging that shifts attention from human agency to the environment. These linguistic features undermine conventional image schemas such as container and source-path-goal , contributing to cognitive disorientation. The study proposes a way of analyzing digital horror narratives and suggests that further quantitatively oriented research may expand understanding of the role of language in constructing textual horror.",

Variational arguments rigorously establish two distinct fragmented phases in the frustrated regime. In the former phase, all four spins of each square plaquette form a collective plaquette singlet, whereas in the latter phase, two dimer singlets are formed along diagonals of each square plaquette. These bound two-magnon states, supplemented with three localized one-magnon states, enable us to elaborate a generalized localized-magnon theory that is applicable in a frustrated regime across the entire field range as confirmed by comparison with exact diagonalization data. The concept of localized magnons provides a consistent description of low-temperature magnetization curves featuring intermediate one-fifth and three-fifths plateaus, which intersect each other at temperature-independent crossing points determined by the relative degeneracies of competing bound-magnon phases. Field variations of the specific heat reveal a pronounced double-peak structure near each field-driven transition with peak heights depending on the relative degeneracies of the respective bound-magnon states. Our results demonstrate that the system supports highly efficient cooling via adiabatic demagnetization, making it a promising candidate for magnetocaloric refrigeration.",

    "Abstract": "Auditory-evoked EEG signals contain rich temporal and cognitive features that reflect both the identity of individuals and their neural response to external stimuli. Traditional unimodal approaches often fail to fully leverage this multidimensional information fully, limiting their effectiveness in real-world biometric and neurocognitive applications. This study aims to develop a unified deep learning model capable of jointly performing biometric identification, auditory stimulus language classification, and device modality recognition, thereby exploiting both physiological and cognitive dimensions of auditory-evoked EEG. We introduce TriNet-MTL (Triple-Task Neural Transformer for Multitask Learning), a multi-branch deep learning framework composed of a shared temporal encoder and a transformer-based sequence modeling unit, trained and validated on auditory-evoked EEG data from 20 human participants (16 males and 4 females). The architecture is designed to simultaneously learn task-specific features via three dedicated output heads, each addressing one of the following: user identity (biometric), stimulus language (native vs. non-native), and stimulus delivery mode (in-ear vs. bone-conduction). The model is trained using a sliding window approach and optimized through joint cross-entropy loss across tasks. TriNet-MTL demonstrates robust performance across all three classification tasks, achieving high accuracy in biometric identification (&gt;93%) and strong generalization in cognitive state inference. Multi-task training further improves representation learning, reducing inter-task interference while enhancing task synergy. The proposed TriNet-MTL framework effectively captures both user-specific and cognitively informative patterns from auditory-evoked EEG, establishing a promising direction for integrated EEG-based biometric authentication and cognitive state monitoring in real-world systems. Significance Statement Understanding how the brain responds to sound offers new ways to identify individuals and assess their cognitive state. This study introduces a deep learning model that can simultaneously recognize a person, determine whether the sound they heard was in their native language, and identify how the sound was delivered. By combining all three tasks, the system learns richer patterns from brain signals, making it more accurate and reliable. Our results show that this approach can improve the performance of brain-based identification systems while also tracking how people process sounds. This work opens new possibilities for secure, brain-driven authentication and real-time cognitive monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "( R , S )-ketamine (ketamine) induces rapid and sustained antidepressant-relevant neuroplastogenic effects in vivo. The metabolite ( 2R , 6R )-hydroxynorketamine (2R6R) forms shortly after the administration of ketamine, and independently elicits rapid plasticity and sustained metaplasticity. Ketamine’s therapeutic actions appear to result from distinct, time-sensitive plasticity phases, though the mechanisms that mediate these phases, and whether these synaptic actions are unique to ketamine or 2R6R, remain poorly understood. Here, we distinguished the synaptic actions of ketamine from its metabolites at the hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 (SC-CA1) synapse. By modifying ketamine’s chemical structure to hinder its metabolism to 2R6R, or exposing slices to ketamine or 2R6R in vitro , we find that 2R6R, but not ketamine itself, induces rapid and sustained metaplasticity in both male and female mice. 2R6R’s acute plasticity and sustained metaplasticity required mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent signaling, and both phases of 2R6R’s synaptic effects were mimicked by pharmacological mTOR activation. Rapid, mTOR-dependent potentiation evoked by 2R6R was followed by long-lasting antidepressant-relevant behavior and metaplasticity that required activation of the inositol trisphosphate receptor. L-type Ca 2+ channel signaling was required for only sustained synaptic actions, consistent with 2R6R’s metaplasticity being activity-dependent. Pharmacological or antibody TrkB blockade after, but not before, 2R6R treatment prevented metaplastic synaptic priming, indicating a delayed contribution of BDNF/TrkB signaling. Blocking protein synthesis did not prevent 2R6R-induced metaplasticity. Our results implicate a sequence of plasticity mechanisms underlying 2R6R’s synaptic actions in the hippocampus. These findings are relevant for the delineation of activity-dependent and time-sensitive synaptic mechanisms relevant to the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Significance statement ( R,S )-ketamine’s therapeutic actions follow distinct, time-sensitive plasticity phases, yet the synaptic mechanisms that mediate these states are unclear. We delineate time-dependent processes distinguishing the hippocampal synaptic actions of ( R,S )-ketamine from its metabolite ( 2R,6R )-hydroxynorketamine (2R6R). We find that 2R6R, but not ( R,S )-ketamine alone, evokes a rapid plasticity and sustained metaplasticity in the mouse hippocampus. Mammalian target of rapamycin activity was necessary and sufficient for the rapid and sustained actions of 2R6R. IP 3 R, BDNF/TrkB, and L-type Ca 2+ channel signaling were necessary for 2R6R’s metaplasticity. These results implicate distinct synaptic mechanisms relevant for the development of novel rapid-acting antidepressants, as well as delineating synaptic mechanisms engaged by activity-dependent behavior and disorders of impaired plasticity.",

    "Abstract": "Cardiotoxicity assessment is a crucial step in the drug development process. With growing interest in alternatives to animal testing, preclinical cardiotoxicity evaluation has become increasingly important. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) offer a physiologically relevant <i>in vitro</i> model for this purpose. As a result, electrophysiological analysis platforms using iPSC-CMs have gained attention. However, conventional microelectrode array (MEA) chips rely on metal electrodes, which are costly and optically opaque. This lack of transparency limits detailed morphological observation of the cells. In this study, we employed an MEA chip incorporating transparent and conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes to simultaneously monitor both morphological changes and field potential (FP) of iPSC-CMs. iPSC-CMs cultured on ITO chips exhibited stable electrophysiological signals reflecting coupled depolarization and repolarization, along with self-organization. Short-term exposure to ion channel blockers did not induce noticeable morphological alterations; however, dose-dependent changes in FPs were observed. In contrast, treatment with cardiotoxic drugs resulted in morphological damage and reduced cell viability, accompanied by progressive alterations in key FP parameters over the treatment period. These findings demonstrate the potential of ITO-based MEA as next-generation cardiotoxicity evaluation platforms capable of real-time monitoring of both drug-induced electrophysiological responses and optical cellular changes.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Although evidence supports the use of point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) in many clinical settings, pediatricians have not widely adopted POCUS. Our objective is to illustrate the impact of POCUS within a children’s hospital by describing a registry of cases in which POCUS guided or changed management. METHODS This is an observational study of a pediatric POCUS registry in an academic children’s hospital. Patient cases were included if POCUS guided or changed diagnostic or procedural management. Cases were identified by the physicians performing the examination, and encounters were separately reviewed. We summarize characteristics of POCUS encounters, including our categorization of diagnostic or procedural changes made as a result. RESULTS We identified 66 patients (median age, 5.5 years [interquartile range, 1–15]) who had 76 POCUS encounters during which ultrasonography changed management or guided a procedure. There were 31 diagnostic POCUS encounters performed on 29 patients. Diagnostic POCUS encounters led to a change in primary diagnosis (48%), changed disposition by facilitating or preventing discharge or transfer to higher levels of care (36%), prompted a procedure (29%), expedited specialist consultation (26%), or obviated additional imaging (19%). There were 45 procedural POCUS encounters performed on 37 patients. Procedural POCUS led to salvaged procedures (49%), prevented placement of unnecessary central venous catheters (16%), and avoided unnecessary procedures (4%). CONCLUSIONS This study describes the impact of POCUS in the care of patients in a children’s hospital. Our results may serve as an impetus for further study, training, and adoption of POCUS within hospital pediatrics.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Therapeutic hypothermia within 6 hours of birth is critical for newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) but is often delayed by transfers to appropriate facilities. Telemedicine (TM) based hypothermia evaluation could expedite these assessments. There is limited evidence on the efficacy of TM compared with the in-person (IP) Sarnat examination. In this study, we aim to compare the TM with the IP examination in infants with suspected HIE. METHODS Newborns were enrolled from March 2022 to December 2023. All infants underwent IP and TM assessments using the modified Sarnat examination within 6 hours after birth. Data included neurologic examination scores for both IP and TM, decisions for hypothermia qualification, and TM technology metrics. Cohen’s kappa statistic (κ) was used to measure the interrater agreement between IP and TM examination findings. RESULTS 170 Sarnat assessments (IP and TM) were performed on 85 enrolled infants. The results show almost perfect agreement between IP and TM regarding signs of moderate or severe HIE (κ = 0.82) and the decision for hypothermia intervention (κ = 0.82). We report fair to moderate agreement (κ = 0.33–0.58) for individual categories of the neurologic examination. 93% of TM examinations were completed within 15 minutes, and 79% of the TM encounters had no technology issues. CONCLUSIONS This study compares IP and TM assessments in infants requiring hypothermia evaluation. Findings show that TM is feasible and not significantly different from IP for making hypothermia decisions in suspected HIE. This could enhance remote Sarnat evaluations and initiate earlier therapeutic interventions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We report formation of ion tracks in amorphous and crystalline silicon by swift heavy ions of 100 MeV Au ions. These tracks contained new allotropes of amorphous silicon, namely high-density (HD) Q-silicon and low-density (LD) α -Silicon, providing evidence for polyamorphism in amorphous silicon. These ion tracks exhibited room-temperature ferromagnetism with tremendous potential for integrating spintronics with microelectronics for novel quantum devices. Using HR STEM-Z (HAADF), we determined that the tracks contained HD Q-Si and LD α -Si in both amorphous and crystalline silicon. The tracks were wider in amorphous silicon compared to crystalline silicon. Thermal properties of silicon played a critical role in the formation and the size of tracks. We discuss a model based upon melting along the tracks and rapid quenching to explain the formation of Q-Si and α -Si based upon undercooling. The Q-Si with nanostructuring as rings and strings showed robust ferromagnetism with a Curie temperature over 500 K. Graphical abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Diaphragm walls are deep reinforced concrete structures cast into the ground allowing the construction of numerous works located in very varied sites and geotechnical conditions (underground station, parking lot, etc.). The pressure applied by the self-weight of the fresh concrete placed inside the deep excavation entails excessive internal bleeding. Significant defects like chimneys of water upwelling (channeling) appears on the wall siding despite the use of filtration test apparatus developed to detect tendencies of concrete bleeding under pressure. This paper proposed an approach from the one-dimensional self-weight consolidation theory, based on soil mechanics, to assess the evolution of the hydrostatic pore pressure in the concrete during its implementation in a diaphragm wall. The investigated concrete was proportioned with a cement water ratio (w/c) of 0.49 to 0.55 with different fines content. A case study is discussed from a concrete poured on site which presented channeling was studied. The experimental results showed that the concrete water migration can start during the pouring phase what was observed on an instrumented column of 1.5 m high. The simulation results from concrete oedometer tests and columns indicates that the consolidation coefficient of concrete is a good indicator of the risk of the appearance of bleed channel.",

A phylogenetic hypothesis was reconstructed, on the basis of an analysis of partial 28S rDNA, including novel molecular data from the new species and from new collections of Heteromicrocotyloides megaspinosus Barton, Beaufrère, Justine, and Whittington, 2009, and Heteromicrocotyloides mirabilis Rohde, 1977 (both Heteromicrocotylidae) from Turrum fulvoguttatum (Forsskål), together with available comparable data for 76 other species representing 18 families of the order Mazocraeidea. The novel hypothesis indicated that the Pyragraphoridae and Heteromicrocotylidae, both characterized, in part, by species possessing fire-tongs-like haptoral clamps, originated independently in a larger, highly supported clade of the order that included species of the Heteraxinidae and the Microcotylidae. The Heteromicrocotylidae was found to be polyphyletic by Heterapta heterapta Unnithan, 1961, occurring independently of the 2 species of Heteromicrocotyloides. In addition, the Microcotylidae was recovered paraphyletic to the Pyragraphoridae and the Heteraxinidae was paraphyletic to the Heteromicrocotylidae. Other instances of para- and polyphyly among the familial and subfamilial taxa within the Mazocraeidea were suggested, but no family-group taxonomic changes were proposed.",

    "Abstract": "In bridge dynamics the current practice is time domain analyses; consequently, there are specific requirements on load model formulation as well as computational intensity. This paper explores a spectral approach to evaluate bridge deck acceleration using an envelope spectrum as a moving correlated load, allowing evaluation for an ensemble of model trains rather than the traditional individual ones. Effects of bridge deck load distribution and of track defects and vehicle imperfections are included. Two loads are used as examples, the existing Eurocode high speed load model (HSLM)-A model load as well as a broad-band load in terms of a white noise. The method is applied on two bridge types, simply supported structures and short-span integral portal frames where the effect of soil–structure interaction is included. The results demonstrate that using an envelope load spectrum has potential to estimate the bridge deck acceleration levels of ordinary structures using a reduced number of simulations. In addition, it offers a potential to use spectral densities in model load development and use of measured data from real traffic. Further simplification shows that for ordinary short-span bridges, at a given damping ratio and at a given acceleration level, an approximate modal mass can be estimated.",

    "Abstract": "This article turns to cruising maps as sites in which normative conceptions of space, place, and time might be reimagined. The authors first examine a brief history of queer mapping practices, paying particular attention to how queer cruising maps challenge constructions of private and public life by charting veiled sexual publics obfuscated by subtle queer social codes. Then, paying particular attention to ephemera and affect, the authors investigate the ways these queer cruising maps are animated by economies of affective experiences and other queer ephemera—feelings, lingerings, barterings, passings, and potentialities. The authors then argue that such an affective experience reorients stabilized notions of space, place, and time. The article concludes with a meditation on the futures of cruising, reflecting on how queer social and sexual relations have been (re)shaped across time into the present moment. Through such a provocation, the authors seek to critically examine how queer sexual practices and counterpublics are mapped and remembered, and how their contours of belonging continue to be contested, opening potentials and possibilities for new queer futures.",

    "Abstract": "In this article, we explore the cases of two Congolese refugee women who have pivoted their social media engagements to entrepreneurship to offset their immobilization resulting from the Tanzanian asylum regime. The fear of losing access to mobile communications amid the introduction of biometric SIM card registration highlighted the critical importance of mobile telephony to the livelihoods of urban refugees in Dar‐es‐Salaam. Based on ethnographic research, including qualitative interviews, focus group discussions, and (digital) observation, we look at the entrepreneurial opportunities facilitated by social media. While highlighting how virtual mobility and connectivity provide an already marginalized group with essential workarounds, our findings also underscore how these online encounters do not substitute for the need for offline connections. We argue for a nuanced reading of technology’s potential to resolve disparities, as we also observe how this potential can reinforce intersectional discrimination based on gender and precarious legal status.",

    "Abstract": "This thematic issue interrogates the relationship between digitalization and the social inclusion or exclusion of migrants in destination countries. Drawing on thirteen articles employing a breadth of methodological approaches across eight national contexts around the globe, it investigates whether digitalization phenomena simply reconfigure pre‐existing socioeconomic inequalities or demonstrate unprecedented, emergent dynamics. Three cross‐cutting themes structure the issue. First, authors provide timely evidence on migrant agency and digital practices, demonstrating how migrants navigate and reappropriate digital technologies. In doing so, they challenge exclusionary infrastructures and offline inequalities. Second, articles analyze the role of intermediary organizations, highlighting contrasting dynamics: On the one hand, state digitalization initiatives produce intentional or unintended exclusionary consequences; on the other, NGOs can leverage these technologies to support migrants in the face of old or technologically intertwined challenges. Finally, the issue zooms into a digital intermediary—the platform economy. Platformization creates new layers of precarity for migrant workers in food delivery and care sectors, and can be prevailed upon in migrant strategies to overcome exclusion. Ultimately, the query as to whether technologies and spaces of digitalization reinforce pre‐existing inclusion or exclusion or create new ones is answered in a nuanced, context‐specific manner that demands even further research: to some extent the embedded power relations in digitalization processes and practices do entail reproduction of the same, but new facets also emerge, and technologies can also be leveraged to challenge inequalities via migrant agency.",

    "Abstract": "Background Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is crucial for managing pediatric hepatobiliary diseases but frequently results in postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction such as delayed flatus and defecation, which can prolong recovery and increase the risk of complications. Nonpharmacological interventions such as acupoint massage and mirabilite application offer potential benefits, but evidence for their efficacy and synergy in children after ERCP is lacking. Objective This study aims to evaluate the individual and combined effects of acupoint massage and abdominal mirabilite application on accelerating gastrointestinal recovery in pediatric patients following ERCP. Methods A single-center, single-blind, randomized controlled trial will be conducted involving 72 children aged between 2 and 12 years who have undergone ERCP. Participants will be randomly allocated to 1 of the 4 groups: acupoint massage group (stimulating ST-36, ST-25, CV-12, and PC-6 for 2 minutes per point; twice daily), mirabilite group (abdominal application for 1 hour; twice daily), combination group (both interventions; at least 1 hour apart), or conventional care group. The primary outcome is the time to first postoperative flatus and defecation. The secondary outcomes include the frequency of postoperative nausea and vomiting and inflammatory markers. Data will be analyzed using intention-to-treat analysis with SPSS, using ANOVA, chi-square, and nonparametric tests as appropriate. Results This trial is currently in progress, having received funding in January 2023 and July 2023. Participant recruitment commenced on November 1, 2024, with an anticipated completion date of October 30, 2026. As of January 2026, a total of 38 pediatric patients have been enrolled and randomized, while data collection and intervention delivery are ongoing. No interim analysis has been conducted. The final analysis will begin after recruitment and follow-up are complete, with primary results expected to be published in the second half of 2026. Conclusions This study is the first to rigorously assess the efficacy and potential synergistic effects of acupoint massage and mirabilite application for enhancing gastrointestinal recovery after pediatric ERCP. Positive findings could establish a safe, nonpharmacological protocol to improve postoperative outcomes, reduce hospital stays, and minimize complications in this vulnerable population.

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Implementation of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening for lung cancer is recommended. The Norwegian Lung Cancer Screening pilot (TIDL) has been conducted to explore recruitment strategy, detection rate and the value of a radiology-led screening program. This publication presents baseline results from the screened participants. Patient/material and methods: All 125,095 individuals aged 60–79 years in Akershus county, Norway were invited to participate. Ever-smokers completed a risk questionnaire based on the PLCOm2012NoRace model: those with ≥35 pack-years or a ≥2.6% 6-year lung cancer risk were eligible for inclusion. Of 2,499 eligible participants, 1,006 underwent baseline LDCT between August 2022 and May 2023, and up to two more rounds later. Nodules were categorized by Lung-RADS v2022. Follow-up and staging were managed by thoracic radiologists; High-suspicion cases were referred to pulmonologists.Results: At baseline, lung cancer was diagnosed in 23 participants (2.3%), whereof 19 (83%) in stage I and 2 (9%) in stage II. Most underwent curative treatment, primarily robot-assisted surgery. Only 2.9% of the screened individuals were referred for further diagnostic evaluation. The false positive rate was 0.6% after pulmonologist referral and 1.7% after radiological staging. A total of 13.8% required 3- or 6-month imaging follow-up. Complication rates from diagnostic procedures were low.Interpretation: LDCT screening using combined risk-based eligibility and a radiology-led model is feasible and effective in the Norwegian context. The high detection rate and low clinical burden support its potential for national implementation. These findings may guide the development of future lung cancer screening programs in the Nordic countries and beyond.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Cancer therapies place an increasing financial burden on societies. In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), an optimised curative-intent treatment combines metastasectomy, local ablative therapy, and perioperative systemic anti-cancer therapy (SACT) under multidisciplinary team guidance. The resource-intensive operative treatment strategy results in better survival than a non-operative approach with SACT only. The cost-effectiveness of the strategy including operative treatment has not been investigated in the era of modern treatment options.Patient/material and methods: A Markov model was developed to estimate lifetime healthcare costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Patients receiving operative treatment, including metastasectomy along with SACT, and those receiving non-operative treatment with SACT only, were identified from the prospective Finnish RAXO study that recruited 1,086 patients between 2012 and 2018. Cost-effectiveness analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted from the healthcare payer’s perspective using 2023 cost levels.Results: The mean lifetime costs (158,309€) for patients with an operative treatment produced 6.57 life years and 5.91 QALYs according to the Markov model. The non-operative treatment group had costs of 77,182€, producing 1.99 life years and 1.74 QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was 19,455€/QALY, with the caveat that more favourable characteristics were present in the operative group. In probabilistic sensitivity analyses with a willingness-to-pay threshold of 30,000€/QALY, the operative treatment group had an 81% probability of being cost-effective. The results were robust in adjusted sensitivity analyses, including propensity score matched subgroups.Interpretation: An operative treatment strategy is cost-effective at a commonly referenced acceptability threshold.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Tibial periprosthetic fractures (PPF), periprosthetic joint infections (PJI), and bearing dislocations (BD) are among the most common short-term complications in medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (mUKA). We aim to assess whether patients with these complications have patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) that differ from patients with primary mUKA, primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), or after revision TKA .Methods: This observational study included 74 mUKA patients reoperated for PPF (n = 22), PJI (n = 15), or BD (n =3 7) between January 2018 and January 2023. Comparator groups included 1,940 primary mUKA, 3,485 primary TKA, and 350 reoperated TKA patients. The primary endpoint was Oxford Knee Score (OKS) at 12 months. Missing data was imputed, and multilevel Tobit regression was used to analyze differences in PROMs.Results: At 12 months, reoperated mUKAs had lower PROM scores than primary mUKAs (OKS difference –3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] –5.0 to –1.5) and TKAs (OKS difference –2.7, CI –4.4 to –0.9) but higher than reoperated TKAs (OKS difference: 3.0, CI 1.1 to 5.0). PPF mUKAs had 12-month scores resembling reoperated TKAs (OKS difference –0.7, CI –3.9 to 2.5). PJI mUKAs and BD mUKAs had 12-month scores resembling primary mUKAs (PJI: OKS difference –2.4, CI –6.2 to 1.5, BD: OKS difference –2.2, CI –4.7 to 0.2) and primary TKAs (PJI: OKS difference –1.7, CI –5.6 to 2.1, BD: OKS-difference –1.6, CI –4.1 to 0.8).Conclusion: Patients reoperated for PJI and BD achieved outcomes comparable to primary mUKAs and TKAs, while PPF resulted in scores lower than primary mUKAs and TKAs, comparable to reoperated TKAs.",

    "Abstract": "As public institutions, French university cafeterias have the potential to favour student well-being and academic performance by offering affordable, high-quality meals. More than half of the student population ate in these facilities at least once a week, with 17% eating there daily. However, limited data exists on students' actual food choices in this context. This study aimed to investigate the role of university catering in student diets, focusing on nutritional quality and environmental impact. Two hundred and fifty-three students were recruited using a non-probability quotas-based sampling method at the entrance of a large university cafeteria in Dijon during autumn 2023. Participants were 56% women and 20.2 (2.6) years old on average; they ate at this cafeteria at least once a week. They were asked to take pictures of their meal tray each time they ate at this cafeteria during three months. They also completed online questionnaires assessing their sociodemographic characteristics, overall diet using a 125-item food frequency questionnaire and attendance at university catering. The nutritional quality and environmental impact of students' food choices at the university cafeteria and of their overall diets were assessed as adherence to French recommendations, sPNNS-GS2 score, and greenhouse gas emissions, kg eCO 2 and calculated for a standard 2000 kcal intake. The results indicated significant potential for improving the nutritional quality and environmental impact of both the students' food choices at the university cafeteria and of their overall diets. While frequent attendance at university catering was associated with healthier food choices ( β =0.15, p =0.027) this did not translate into a broader improvement in the overall nutritional quality of students' diets ( β =0.09, p =0.222). No associations were found between attendance at university catering with neither environmental impact of food choices ( β =0.03, p =0.170) nor of overall diets ( β =0.05, p =0.291). These findings suggest that although university catering has the potential to promote healthier and more sustainable eating habits, its full potential has yet to be realised notably by increasing the availability of healthier and more environmentally-friendly options such as legume-based dishes.",

    "Abstract": "The paper is based on an ethnographic research conducted at a Czech grammar school as part of a PhD thesis that was defended in January 2010. The research within a single class of 11-13 year olds was focused on (re)production of gender in the school environment. The research strived to apply a complex perspective on gender reproduction within the classroom. The presented analysis is inspired by Valerie Walkerdine’s statement that gender is theorized as a fiction, shot through with fantasy, yet lived as a fact, produced and struggled over within the regulatory daily practices of schooling (Walkerdine, 1990). Using the technique of writing short text the role of gender in children’s fantasies was researched.",

    "Abstract": "Carbon dioxide undergoes rapid dissociation during high-speed entry into the Mars atmosphere. This process is closely related to the heat transfer on the surface of a spacecraft. A precise quantitative characterization of this nonequilibrium process is critical for accurate aerodynamic heating predictions. A [Formula: see text] tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy ([Formula: see text]-TDLAS) was developed and coupled to the previous CO-TDLAS system for simultaneous temperature, CO concentration, and [Formula: see text] concentration measurements during the [Formula: see text] dissociation process. The R(0, 88) line in the [Formula: see text] fundamental vibrational band was selected, and its absorption cross section was calibrated over 3030–5990 K. The new setup was then applied to studies of [Formula: see text] dissociation behaviors. Evident deviations were found between measurements and model predictions. Sensitivity analysis was performed to find out the key reaction impacting [Formula: see text] dissociation and to suppress the impacts of secondary reactions. The reaction rate coefficient of [Formula: see text] was updated as an Arrhenius equation over 2980–6030 K. The revised mechanism with updated rate coefficient predicts more accurate [Formula: see text] dissociation behaviors over 3000–6000 K. In addition, this study provides a functional methodology to determine the rate coefficient of a specific elementary reaction over a wide temperature range with low uncertainty.",

    "Abstract": "In the field of toxicology, snake bites are recognized as a significant cause capable of mimicking brain death. A neurotoxic snakebite can manifest with a wide range of symptoms, causing asymptomatic cases to more severe presentations. Common symptoms include ptosis and complete external and internal ophthalmoplegia, which indicate paralysis of the eye muscles. In severe cases, the bite can lead to complete respiratory failure, necessitating urgent medical intervention. Here, we present a patient with a neuro paralytic snake bite with conditions mimicking brain death. The patient achieved full neurological recovery following treatment with polyvalent snake antivenom and supportive care. This case underscores the importance of considering the neuroparalytic effects of snake bites when assessing patients, as it may lead to a false diagnosis of brain death. Intensivists should carefully evaluate these potential effects before deciding to withdraw ventilatory supp]ort or consider organ donation.",

Tongue scalloping, or “lingua indentata,” is an easily recognizable clinical sign characterized by indentations along the lateral border of the tongue. Although conventionally considered a benign dental or nutritional finding, recent evidence suggests a strong association between tongue scalloping and OSA, especially in individuals with macroglossia or retrognathia.

    "Abstract": "Background: Traumatic brain injury poses a significant challenge for trauma victims. Early identification of such injuries in the emergency department can significantly improve patient outcomes. Apart from clinical examination, the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) has been introduced for early diagnosis in the emergency department. Methodology: A prospective analysis of all the patients admitted with suspected head injury who underwent Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) head was done. All such patients were evaluated with ultrasound-guided Optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) assessment, and the same was correlated with Rotterdam CT score (RCTS). Results: 112 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean age of the study population was 39.02 ± 15.38 years with a male preponderance. ONSD correlated with higher RCTS (&gt;3) with a cut-off value of 5.62 mm as per the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The current study identified significant predictors of raised intracranial pressure (ICP), with epidural mass lesions (OR = 1.131, p = 0.017), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) or subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (OR = 1.071, p = 0.016), and episodes of vomiting as key predictors. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that ultrasonographic measurement of the ONSD correlates reliably in patients with traumatic brain injury. Moreover, clinical factors such as vomiting, epidural mass lesions, and intraventricular or subarachnoid haemorrhage were significant predictors of elevated ICP, providing valuable adjunctive criteria for risk stratification in emergency care.",

    "Abstract": "Lemmas, flemmas, and level-6 word families (WF6) are three commonly discussed lexical units. Because each makes differing assumptions about learner knowledge, the selection of one unit over another in research or pedagogy has a great impact on interpretations of the lexical challenge. It is therefore important to fully understand these assumptions so that practitioners can select the most suitable unit for a given purpose. This study introduces an enhanced version of Nation’s BNC-COCA word lists that can be used to quantify several features of lexical units (https://osf.io/4mz6y/?view_only=a295f0089f8745c29667ef21479578c6). The original WF6 lists were adapted by including flemma and lemma groupings, part-of-speech (POS) tags, morphological codings, frequency data, and an expanded list of proper nouns. Analyses of lexical unit composition reveal that the rapid corpus coverage of WF6 is due to its much greater inclusivity than flemmas and lemmas in the 1-2k bands and that irregular forms make up a considerable proportion of 1k tokens regardless of the unit chosen. Accuracy checks then suggest that POS-tagged lists offer an improvement over untagged lists due to the latter’s overestimation of coverage and blocking of homographic concepts. An examination of semantic extension reveals that polysemy is almost as frequent in lemmas as in flemmas and that figurative extension is an important aspect of lexical knowledge. Finally, lexical and morphological profiling shows that threshold coverage values are unlikely to be reached without knowledge of at least mid-frequency basewords and tens of derivational affixes in most genres.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study aimed to investigate the neurophysiological characteristics of panic disorder (PD) by analyzing quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) data, with a particular focus on high beta activity.Methods In this retrospective study, resting-state QEEG data from 58 patients with PD and 23 healthy controls (HC) were analyzed. Spectral power was calculated for delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), beta (12–25 Hz), and high beta (25–30 Hz) bands across frontal, central, and posterior regions. Group differences were assessed using generalized estimating equations, and Pearson correlation analyses were conducted to examine associations between electroencephalography activity and clinical symptoms.Results PD patients showed significantly higher high beta power across all regions compared to HC (frontal: estimate=1.276, χ²=12.48, p&lt;0.0010; central: estimate=0.874, χ²=9.87, p=0.0017; posterior: estimate=0.524, χ²=4.48, p=0.0343). Beta power was elevated only in the frontal region (estimate=3.391, χ²=5.31, p=0.0212), while delta power was increased overall (χ²=4.60, p=0.0390) without regional specificity. No significant group differences were observed in alpha or theta bands. A significant positive correlation was found between frontal high beta power and Panic Disorder Severity Scale scores (r=0.41, p=0.010), while no other significant correlations were observed between regional high beta power and clinical scales.Conclusion Increased high beta, beta, and delta activity in PD may reflect a neurophysiological imbalance. In particular, elevated high beta power may indicate hyperarousal and excessive cognitive control in PD, suggesting its potential as a future biomarker.",

    "Abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis is an encapsulated, aerobic, Gram-negative diplococcal bacterium that is oxidase-positive. It grows on chocolate agar, soybean agar, and Mueller-Hinton agar. This organism causes meningitis, a serious bacterial disease characterized by fever, headache, nausea, neck and muscle pain. It is transmitted via airborne droplets originating from respiratory and throat secretions. Neisseria meningitidis colonizes the upper layers of the mucosal tissues in infected individuals, invades the bloodstream, and can lead to severe septicemia and meningitis. The bacterium is responsible for high mortality rates in children as well as adults worldwide. Despite the use of antibiotics, the current mortality rate remains around 10%. The phenotypic classification of Neisseria meningitidis includes twelve serogroups based on variations in surface structures such as the polysaccharide capsule, lipooligosaccharide, and outer membrane proteins. Among these twelve serogroups, five (A, B, C, W, Y) are the primary causes of disease and have contributed significantly to the global spread of meningococcal infections. The bacterial capsule plays a crucial role in inducing bactericidal antibodies, particularly those targeting the polysaccharide capsule, which is essential for vaccine development. An exception is the B-polysaccharide, which has low immunogenicity. The capsule has several functions: it protects against the host immune system by preventing phagocytosis, facilitates colonization of the nasopharynx, and protects the bacteria during bloodstream dissemination, enabling it to reach the meninges and cause meningitis. Furthermore, the capsule contributes to antibiotic resistance and is a key component in vaccines, particularly those containing polysaccharide or protein-conjugated polysaccharide formulations. Vaccination is considered one of the most effective preventive measures against meningococcal disease. Neisseria meningitidis also possesses two types of (cilia), which aid in adhesion to epithelial cells. Recent studies have identified genetic mutations that introduce new mechanisms for developing antibiotic resistance, such as mutations in the rpsJ and TetM genes. To enhance prevention strategies against meningococcal disease, a novel antigen named 4CMenB has been identified through serogroup analysis. A protein-polysaccharide conjugation approach was applied, leading to improved T-cell immunity and memory cell immune responses. Third-generation cephalosporins are commonly used for the treatment of drug-resistant strains. Objective: To summarize the molecular characteristics of Neisseria meningitidis, the causes of infection, preventive strategies, and its epidemiology.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Agricultural mulches are commonly used for their benefits, however, the mechanisms by which they affect microbial communities to mediate soil properties that influence tomato growth remain unclear. Methods A three-year experiment was conducted comparing four treatments: plastic film mulching alone (SBF), straw mulching alone (SM), film-straw dual mulching (SBFSF), and no mulching (CK). Their effects on soil properties, microbial communities, and tomato growth were systematically evaluated. Results All mulching treatments significantly increased tomato yield, with SBF, SM, and SBFSF demonstrating improvement of 32.87%, 22.17%, and 50.17%, respectively. SBFSF exhibited the greatest dry matter weight (shoot plus root), root length, and root surface area 40 days post-transplanting, and it showed the strongest effect on soil moisture and thermoregulation. SM and SBFSF significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC: +5.92%, +4.04%), total nitrogen (TN: +6.34%, +4.46%), available potassium (AK: +18.15%, +10.91%), and available phosphorus (AP: +2.60%, +2.15%). SBFSF significantly reduced the diversity of soil bacteria and fungi, howerer, it selectively increased the relative abundances of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria and functional microorganisms involved in carbon-nitrogen cycling, such as the bacterial phylum Firmicutes(+125.18% to +193.55%), genera Lysobacter (+49.19% to +186.62%) and Bacillus (+168.56% to +273.00%), and fungal phyla Ascomycota (+7.99% to +8.19%) and Mortierellomycota (+11.05% to +98.71%), including the genus Trichocladium (+30.43% to +269.95%). In contrast, SM and SBF led to an increase in the abundance of pathogenic fungi ( Fusarium , Cladosporium , Alternaria , and Cephaliophora ), elucidating their inferior yield performance compared to SBFSF. Discussion Partial least squares path modeling (PLS-PM) analysis indicated that mulching practices directly and positively influenced the soil bacterial and fungal community composition and negatively affected soil fungal community diversity, which indirectly effecting tomato growth by modulating soil properties. These results provide a scientific foundation for improving mulching, and sustainable agricultural practices.",

    "Abstract": "Soil fauna play a critical role in the restoration of abandoned mining areas, uniquely contributing to soil formation, development, and the rehabilitation of degraded soils. This role is intricately linked with miwcrobial activity. Previous research has mainly concentrated on the direct effects of soil fauna on the physicochemical properties of soils in abandoned sites, often overlooking their indirect impacts on soil ecological functions via changes in soil microbial communities. This study undertakes a microcosm experiment by introducing soil fauna into the soil from coal mining abandoned lands to explore shifts in microbial communities. Results demonstrate that collembolan treatments significantly reduce fungi abundance, whereas earthworm treatments notably decrease the Shannon and Chao1 index for both bacterial and fungi communities. Soil fauna treatments modify the structure and composition of microbial communities, with more distinct differences in fungi community structures. Additionally, various soil fauna treatments markedly change microbial interactions; earthworm treatments impact microbial communities more than collembolan treatments, and combined treatments (EC) are more effective in enhancing microbial community stability compared to individual treatments (C, E). Network analysis has identified key microbial taxa that are positively correlated with soil fauna abundance, suggesting that future management strategies could manipulate key microbial taxa through soil fauna to enhance the restoration of soil ecological functions. These findings offer a detailed understanding of the dynamics of microbial communities under biotic interactions, essential for the ecological restoration of soils in abandoned mining areas.",

    "Abstract": "Background Children living in low socioeconomic status (SES) environments are more likely to develop behavior problems. Breastfeeding is one behavior that has been positively linked to mental health throughout childhood. We investigated whether breastfeeding modifies the association between low SES and behavior problems. Methods We studied a subset of the Canadian CHILD cohort ( N = 2,342). Lower SES ( n = 592) was defined as one or more of: (1) low income based on family size, (2) single parenthood, or (3) maternal education below a post-secondary degree. Breastfeeding was reported by caregivers from birth to 2 years. The Child Behavior Checklist (mean 50, SD (10), comprising internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior scores) was administered at 5 years. We tested main effects and interactions between SES and breastfeeding on child behavior, adjusting for several maternal and child characteristics. Results Lower SES was related to higher (worse) behavior scores ( B = 2.06 [95%CI: 1.06, 3.07] for total behavior scores), while longer and more exclusive breastfeeding was related to lower (better) behavior scores ( B = −2.43 [95% CI: −3.74, −1.11] for exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months, compared to no breastfeeding, for total behavior scores). We observed significant interactions between longer and more exclusive breastfeeding and family SES on internalizing and total behavior scores, indicating that the “socioeconomic gap” in behavior scores becomes smaller with more exclusive and longer breastfeeding. Conclusion This study provides new evidence that breastfeeding may be one factor that can help reduce socioeconomic inequities in child behavior scores.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Circuit training (CT) is a time-efficient resistance training method widely used to elicit neuromuscular and metabolic adaptations. However, the influence of different work-to-rest interval durations within a fixed 1:1 ratio on acute neuromuscular fatigue remains unclear. The present study aims to examine the acute effects of different 1:1 CT work-to-rest interval durations (10s, 20s, and 30s) on neuromuscular fatigue. Methods Thirty-four physically active participants (15 males and 19 females) completed 14-min CT protocols, each consisting of two 6-min blocks separated by a 2-min rest period and involving six alternating upper- and lower-body exercises (leg press, bench press, unilateral right knee extension, bilateral row, unilateral left knee extension, and seated overhead press). CT includes six exercises alternating lower- and upper-body movements. Mean propulsive velocity (MPV) was measured for squat (SQ) and bench press (BP) exercises before and after each session, and the total number of repetitions performed per exercise and set was recorded. Results A significant main effect of time (pre- vs. postdata) was observed for MPV in both the SQ ( p &amp;lt; 0.001) and the BP ( p &amp;lt; 0.001) exercises. Velocity loss revealed significant differences between the SQ and the BP exercises ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). The 30:30 protocol consistently performed a higher repetition rate (0,612–0,806 rep/s) compared with both 10:10 (0,488–0,768 rep/s) and 20:20 (0,488–0,754 rep/s) protocols. Conclusions A significant reduction in MPV was observed following all protocols, indicating the presence of acute neuromuscular fatigue regardless of interval duration. Although no statistically significant differences in fatigue magnitude were detected between protocols, work-to-rest interval duration influenced repetition output and execution characteristics, with the 30:30 protocol allowing greater repetition volume compared with the 10:10 and 20:20 protocols.",

    "Abstract": "Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are implicated in adverse developmental and reproductive outcomes, yet their identification remains a major challenge in chemical safety assessment. Current testing strategies rely heavily on animal models, which are constrained by ethical concerns, interspecies differences, and limited mechanistic resolution but justified by the complexity of the endocrine system and its physiology. Capturing the complex biology of intact organisms and incorporating toxicokinetic properties in alternative test methods is challenging. To address this, the European Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals (PARC) is advancing the development and regulatory integration of new approach methodologies (NAMs). This project specifically contributes by developing and validating human-relevant NAMs to identify key aspects of endocrine disruption relevant to developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART). Key innovative activities include predictive modeling, refinement of zebrafish and amphibian embryo assays, and establishment of advanced in vitro systems for assessing toxicity in the oocyte, testis, placenta, and brain. By combining mechanistic insights with multi-modality and high throughput testing strategies, this work aims to improve the predictive power and regulatory utility of NAMs for ED identification within the One Health paradigm.",

    "Abstract": "Early prediction of diabetes remains a major healthcare challenge, as timely diagnosis can significantly reduce the risk of severe complications. Most existing studies emphasize complex predictive models or extensive preprocessing pipelines, while comparatively limited attention has been given to improving feature representations. In this study, we propose a statistical framework for enriching the feature space of diabetes data using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to capture latent distributional characteristics and local density patterns. The resulting enriched features enhance class discrimination while preserving model simplicity, allowing standard classifiers to operate more effectively. The proposed framework is evaluated on two diabetes datasets with different sample sizes and class distributions. Models trained on the enriched feature set are compared with baseline models trained solely on the original features, using multiple strategies, including direct feature concatenation and ensemble-based approaches. Experimental results show that the enriched feature space consistently outperforms the original feature set, leading to notable improvements in overall predictive performance. In particular, the framework achieves a substantial increase in sensitivity for the minority class (diabetic cases), which is especially important for clinical applications where positive samples are typically scarce relative to healthy cases.",

The IMNSVM uses a one-sided ε-band and minimizes ε to achieve a better fitting effect for the same class of training points. By introducing a new variable, ρ, the IMNSVM keeps one class of training points at a certain distance from the hyperplane corresponding to another class of training points, keeping them as far away as possible so as to better adapt to the training points and better describe the difference in data distribution between different categories. The IMNSVM can degenerate into the standard support vector machine (SVM) under certain conditions and is applicable to a wider range of data types. Finally, numerical experiments also explain the effectiveness of the method.",

This paper presents a novel mobile device for manipulating microrobots to deliver therapeutic agents to damaged knee cartilage areas using external magnetic fields. A curved telescopic mechanism, proposed for the first time, enables effective navigation along complex human body contours, thereby overcoming the limitations of conventional linear approaches. The device is equipped with a precise closed-loop controller. A model-based optimization of magnetic end-effector position and orientation is developed to ensure high targeting efficiency and repeatability. The system performances are verified in a human-sized phantom model, demonstrating the superior targeting accuracy, and achieving outcomes exceeding those of conventional systems.

    "Abstract": "The performance upgrading of stratospheric airships hinges on breakthroughs in the mechanical properties of envelope materials. As a multi-layer composite, the envelope’s load-bearing layer exhibits orthotropic and nonlinear mechanical behaviors owing to its unique structure and manufacturing process. To overcome the limitations of traditional testing methods and classical strength criteria in characterizing envelope materials, this paper presents a systematic investigation of typical airship envelope materials. The classical cruciform biaxial specimen was modified with a double-layer heat-sealed loading arm design to ensure preferential failure of the core region. Combined with digital image correlation (DIC) equipment, tensile tests were conducted under seven warp–weft stress ratios to acquire full-range stress–strain data. A three-dimensional stress–strain response surface was fitted based on the experimental results, and biaxial tensile constitutive models with varying precisions were established. Furthermore, a five-parameter implicit quadratic strength criterion was adopted to characterize the failure envelope of the envelope material. The model was calibrated using five biaxial failure points and independently validated against uniaxial tensile strengths, achieving a prediction error of less than 4%. The criterion’s generalization capability was enhanced through systematic parameterization based on the present test data. This work provides experimental evidence and reliable support for the engineering design and strength prediction of envelope materials.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid expansion of greenhouse agriculture demands sustainable strategies to maintain soil health and productivity from the outset. Priestia megaterium, a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR), has shown promise in improving plant growth and soil nutrient availability, but its efficacy in newly established greenhouse systems, where the soil microbiome is still developing, remains underexplored. This study evaluated the impact of P. megaterium inoculation on cucumber growth, soil nutrient bioavailability, and soil microbial communities in a greenhouse with only two years of operation. A two-year experiment was conducted with conventional fertilization as the control and P. megaterium inoculation (7.0 × 108 cfu mL−1) at different rates (37.5, 75, 150, and 300 L ha−1) and timings. Soil and plant nutrient content were measured, and microbial communities were analyzed through 16S rRNA sequencing and co-occurrence network analysis. Results showed that applying P. megaterium at 75 L ha−1 during seedling transplantation significantly increased soil available phosphorus (AP) by 11.64–26.48% and available potassium (AK) by 11.27–47.31% compared to the control, while enhancing cucumber yield by 6.71–9.28%. The inoculant also increased soil bacterial diversity, enriched beneficial genera such as Lysobacter, Pseudomonas, and Flavobacterium, and reduced the abundance of Xanthomonas. Furthermore, P. megaterium application promoted a more complex and stable bacterial network, with higher connectivity and modularity. These findings suggest that P. megaterium is a viable strategy for enhancing soil health and productivity in newly established greenhouse systems, offering an environmentally sustainable alternative to traditional fertilization methods.",

    "Abstract": "Image enhancement can effectively improve the contrast, clarity, and information content of images, thereby improving visual quality. Image enhancement has significant application value in the process of identifying and diagnosing agricultural pests and diseases. This paper proposes a color image enhancement method based on color space transformation, converting the image from the RGB space to the HSV space, conducting targeted enhancement on the V channel, and combining adaptive brightness adjustment and Gamma correction to further improve the visual effect. To achieve better enhancement results, this paper designs a crayfish optimization algorithm with a random perturbation strategy and removal similarity operation (COA-RPRS). This algorithm achieves a dynamic balance between exploration and exploitation through an adaptive temperature calculation formula and improves the position update mechanism in the summer escape, competition, and foraging stages, significantly enhancing convergence performance. Moreover, introducing a removal similarity operation and a random perturbation strategy based on Lévy flight effectively maintains population diversity and prevents premature convergence. Experimental verification was conducted on the CEC 2017 test functions, 20 color images, and 10 images of rice pests and diseases, showing that COA-RPRS achieves superior performance compared to eight other comparison algorithms in both global optimization and color image enhancement tasks. These results suggest its potential applicability in supporting intelligent recognition and diagnostic systems for agricultural pest and disease management.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of the study was to assess the effect of superabsorbents on the condition of selected legume species grown with different watering frequencies. Three two-factor pot experiments were conducted in MICRO-CLIMA phytotrons. The objects of the study were three legume species: faba bean, pea and soybean. The first factor was the superabsorbent (SAP) rate (0, 2, 4, and 6 g·kg−1 of substrate), while the second factor was the watering frequency (the subjects were watered every 1, 3, 6, and 9 days). The study showed that faba bean and pea plants were significantly taller after superabsorbent application (by 17 and 11%, respectively) and developed greater root mass. The application of SAPs at a rate of 6 g·kg−1 increased the dry weight of the underground parts of faba beans and peas (by 56.8% and 85.9%, respectively) compared to the control. The highest SAP dose reduced the Fv/Fm index in soybean and the PI index in faba bean and soybean (by 5 and 29%, respectively). The lowest SPAD index in peas was recorded in the control treatment (without SAPs) and in soybeans at the highest dose of SAPs (6 g·kg−1). In all species, the best results for growth and biomass of the aboveground parts were obtained with daily watering, which increased plant height by an average of 26.5–60.9% and the dry mass of the aboveground parts by 42.6–60.6% compared to less frequent watering. Higher values of the Fv/Fm index were observed in soybean, and higher values of the PI index were observed in faba bean, pea, and soybean in the least frequently watered treatments. In all species studied, the SPAD index was higher under conditions of the greatest water deficit (watering every 9 days) compared to plants watered every 1, 3, and 6 days.",

On a farm in three halls with the same interior equipment, the effect of different constructions of walls and roofs of buildings on the internal thermal and humidity microclimate was investigated. Microclimatic conditions and chickens’ performance were compared in two identical lightweight panel halls (49,000 chickens each) with light aluminum roof sheets (L* = 81.4 ± 0.4), and against conditions and results in a massive brick house (31,200 chickens) with a dark eternit roof (L* = 35.7 ± 3.5). The dark color of the roof surfaces and parts of the walls of the brick house accelerated the increase in air temperature in the house. The air temperature was 0.7 to 2 K higher in the house with darker surfaces, which was also reflected in a higher THI. The duration of chickens’ stay in conditions of higher heat stress (THI above 28.3) was 1.84 times longer in this house than in houses with light surfaces, which had the effect of increasing water consumption by 30%. The effect of heat accumulation of the brick structure on the attenuation of high temperature was not significant.",

This article’s narrative reviews the evolutionary path from traditional two-dimensional (2D) cell culture to advanced three-dimensional (3D) organoid technology, focusing on how organoid technology overcomes the limitations of traditional models in terms of physiological relevance, species specificity, and ethical constraints. The review article elaborates on the current state of organoid research in veterinary science, including the construction of models for organs such as the intestine, liver, and reproductive system in livestock and companion animals. Addressing existing technical bottlenecks—such as insufficient model complexity, lack of standardization, and difficulties in simulating vascularization and the immune microenvironment—future development directions are proposed, including multi-organ chips, AI-assisted analysis, and the integration of gene editing. Research indicates that with the deep integration of cutting-edge technologies such as biomaterials, microfluidics, 3D printing, and AI, organoid technology is progressively becoming a core driver for advancing veterinary precision medicine, holding broad application prospects.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: In food-producing animal (FPA) environments, healthy animals can act as reservoirs of potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli, which can be transmitted through the food chain to humans. This study aimed to evaluate cloacal E. coli in healthy Sicilian lambs subjected to an experimental feeding regimen by assessing bacterial levels, antimicrobial resistance, virulence traits, and the clonal relationships, as well as the impact of a pistachio skin as an agro-industrial by-product supplement during a 58-day feeding trial. Methods: A total of 295 E. coli isolates from the control (CTRL) and treatment (Treated) groups at initial time (T0) and final time (T1) were phenotypically and genotypically characterized using Kirby–Bauer antimicrobial testing, multiplex PCR for virulence genes, and PFGE for clonal analysis. Results: The feeding regimen did not significantly influence the prevalence, abundance, or virulence of the E. coli isolates. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) were the most common pathotype, mainly carrying the stx1 gene, while the Enteroinvasive (EIEC) type was detected only sporadically. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) predominated at T0, while enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) at T1, and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), initially prevalent in Treated samples, disappeared by T1. Antimicrobial resistance profiles varied among isolates, with the highest resistance observed in the CTRL group. However, both groups exhibited high resistance to streptomycin, and 9% of CTRL isolates were multidrug resistant. A notable reduction in overall resistance rates, especially in the Treated group, was observed, indicating a dietary effect on the E. coli resistome. PFGE genotyping showed high genetic diversity, with resistance traits more frequently detected than virulence factors. Conclusions: This study highlights that healthy lambs serve as reservoirs for potentially human-pathogenic E. coli and suggests that dietary regimes could effectively reduce antibiotic resistance.",

    "Abstract": "The mining industry relies heavily on large-scale machinery, making operational efficiency highly sensitive to equipment breakdowns and maintenance interruptions. Such breakdowns directly affect production performance, operational costs, and planning accuracy. Therefore, the ability to predict machinery downtime particularly for haul trucks, loaders, drilling machinery, and dozers used in open-pit operations is essential for improving productivity and ensuring reliable mine planning. This study aims to predict machinery breakdowns and estimate the annual total number of breakdowns using machine-learning techniques applied to a fully digitalized dataset of 16,027 breakdown and maintenance records collected from an open-pit coal mine. A Random Forest classification model was developed to identify the breakdown unit for each event, achieving an accuracy of 94%, while a Random Forest regression model estimated the annual breakdown counts with an R2 value of 0.98. In addition, the relationships between breakdown frequency and key production indicators were examined using linear regression and correlation analyses. The results show a strong association between run-of-mine quantities and coal production, a moderate relationship between stripping activity and breakdown frequency, and negligible linear relationships between breakdowns and production volumes. Overall, the findings demonstrate that integrating machine-learning models with operational mining data can significantly enhance predictive maintenance, reduce unplanned downtime, and improve production planning in open-pit mining operations.",

    "Abstract": "Wireless short-range transmission is essential for precise wellbore trajectory control and real-time formation evaluation. Its signal propagation characteristics are influenced by multiple factors, including antenna type, drill collar, mud, and formation resistivity. Most prior studies are based on Magnetic-field Antennas (MFA) and primarily focus on the effects of formation resistivity variations, whereas the investigations on the influence of drill collars and mud resistivity are limited. In this study, a three-dimensional finite-element electromagnetic model of the “antenna–drill collar–mud–formation” system was developed to investigate wireless short-range transmission. The model was used to characterize and compare the electromagnetic field distributions of MFA and Electric-field Antennas (EFA) under in situ conditions. On this basis, a set of parametric sensitivity analyses on transmission performance was performed to quantify the effects of key factors, including drill-collar conductivity and mud resistivity. The results reveal fundamentally different electromagnetic field distributions for the two antenna types: (1) MFA is dominated by localized circumferential magnetic flux loops, whereas EFA transmits signals through axially extended eddy-current channels. (2) The drill collar exerts opposite effects on the two antennas, suppressing signal levels for MFA while significantly enhancing transmission for EFA, resulting in signal amplitudes that are 103−105 times higher. (3) In addition, mud resistivity has little influence on MFA, whereas increasing mud resistivity leads to the pronounced attenuation of EFA signals. These findings provide a quantitative basis for antenna selection and performance optimization in wireless short-range transmission systems under different Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) conditions.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to develop load–velocity (L-V) profiles for prone bench pulls and half squats in elite female traditional rowers, and to assess their association with rowing performance. Eight highly trained female rowers, members of the team that won the Spanish Traditional Rowing Championship, completed a graded exercise test (GXT) on a rowing ergometer, followed by one-repetition maximum (1RM) and incremental loading tests. L-V profiles were established using mean velocity (MV) data collected with a linear velocity transducer. Correlation analyses were conducted to examine the associations between movement velocities at specific relative loads and GXT performance. The slope of the linear regression was slightly higher for the prone bench pull (MV = −0.0127 m·s−1) than for the half squat (MV = −0.0104 m·s−1). A similar correlation could be observed, although slightly higher, for the half squat (r = 0.929; p &lt; 0.001) exercise compared to the bench pull (r = 0.922; p &lt; 0.001). In this exploratory analysis, a statistically significant correlation was observed between rowing performance and MV at 30% 1RM for both exercises (r = 0.856 and r = 0.866, respectively; p &lt; 0.05). No other load intensities demonstrated statistically significant correlations with performance. The findings highlight the utility of L-V profiling at lower relative loads in traditional rowing performance among elite female athletes. The results support the application of velocity-based training (VBT) in rowing-specific strength programs and suggest that performance optimization may be achieved through high-velocity movements performed with submaximal loads. Furthermore, this study reinforces the value of individualized L-V profiles and real-time velocity monitoring for tailoring resistance training interventions.",

    "Abstract": "Due to its cost-effective and high-efficiency retrieval advantages, deep hashing has attracted extensive attention in the field of cross-modal retrieval. However, despite significant progress in existing deep cross-modal hashing methods, several limitations persist: they struggle to establish consistent mapping relationships across different modalities, fail to effectively bridge the semantic gap between heterogeneous data, and consequently suffer from semantic information loss and incomplete semantic understanding during cross-modal learning. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Feature Fusion-based Cross-modal Proxy Hashing (FFCPH) retrieval method. This approach integrates multi-modal semantic information through a feature fusion module to generate discriminative and robust fused features. Furthermore, a novel joint loss function, which comprises cross-modal proxy loss, cross-modal irrelevant loss, and cross-modal consistency loss, is designed to preserve inter-sample similarity ranking accuracy and mitigate the semantic gap across modalities. Experimental results on three widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in retrieval performance.",

    "Abstract": "This study presents Care-MOVE, a smartphone-based application designed for continuous, passive, and unobtrusive monitoring of mobility, environmental exposure, and cognitive status in older adults within a telemedicine framework. The system integrates movement-related data collected through smartphone sensors (GPS, activity recognition, and caloric expenditure estimation) with contextual air quality information and standardized neuropsychological assessments, resulting in a comprehensive multimodal dataset (Care-MOVE Dataset). An exploratory proof-of-concept study was conducted on a subsample of 53 participants aged over 65, each monitored continuously for five days, contributing on average more than 30,000 longitudinal records. To investigate whether daily motor behavior can serve as a digital biomarker of cognitive functioning, several Machine Learning and Deep Learning models were evaluated using a Leave-One-User-Out (LOUO) cross-validation strategy. The comparative analysis included traditional classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines) as well as temporal deep learning architectures (1D CNN, LSTM, GRU, and Transformer). Among all of the evaluated approaches, the Support Vector Machine with RBF kernel achieved the best performance, reaching an accuracy of 98.1%, a balanced accuracy of 0.988, and an F1-score of 0.981, demonstrating robust generalization across unseen subjects. For this reason, the study was designed and presented as an exploratory proof-of-concept rather than a definitive clinical validation. This integrated approach not only enables the collection of detailed and contextualized data but also opens new perspectives for proactive digital healthcare, focused on risk prevention, improving quality of life, and promoting autonomy in elderly patients.",

    "Abstract": "CubeSat missions increasingly rely on microwave-band communication systems, whose antennas often exhibit directional radiation patterns. As a result, multiple antennas are commonly used to improve coverage; however, a quantitative method to evaluate their performance across all spacecraft attitudes has been lacking. This paper introduces the Coverage Ratio of CubeSat Attitude (CRCA), a metric that quantifies the proportion of orientations for which the antenna gain exceeds a required threshold. CRCA is introduced and demonstrated using the S-band command antenna system of the 6U CubeSat VERTECS. The proposed metric is then used to quantitatively compare multiple antenna placement configurations, clarifying the effect of mounting faces on attitude-dependent coverage. Electromagnetic simulations and three-dimensional radiation pattern measurements using a metal CubeSat enclosure show good agreement when splitter and cable losses are taken into account. The combined radiation pattern achieves greater than −8.0 dBic in 90% of attitudes in simulation, and greater than −10.0 dBic of attitudes in 90% in measurement. Furthermore, a CRCA-based link budget analysis demonstrates that sufficient uplink margin can be conservatively maintained under tumbling conditions. The proposed CRCA framework provides a practical and generalizable approach for evaluating antenna omnidirectionality and attitude-dependent communication performance in CubeSat missions.",

    "Abstract": "Infrasound, physically defined as sound at frequencies below 20 Hertz, can travel long distances with minimal attenuation and permeate biological tissues due to its marked particle displacement and deep penetration. Generated by both natural phenomena and human-made systems, infrasound has drawn increasing scientific and public attention regarding its potential physiological and psychological effects. Experimental studies demonstrate that infrasound can modulate mechanosensitive structures at the cellular level, particularly pressure-sensitive ion channels such as PIEZO1 and TRPV4, leading to intracellular calcium influx, oxidative stress, altered intercellular communication, and in some settings, apoptosis. These responses vary according to sound pressure levels, frequencies, exposure duration, and tissue type. In the cardiovascular system, higher sound pressures have been associated with mitochondrial injury and fibrosis, whereas low sound pressures may exert context-dependent protective effects. In animal models, prolonged or intense exposure to infrasound has been shown to induce neuroinflammatory responses and memory impairment. Short-term studies in humans at moderate intensities have reported minimal physiological changes, with psychological and contextual factors influencing symptom perception. Occupational environments such as factories and agricultural settings may contain elevated levels of infrasound, underscoring the importance of systematic measurements and exposure assessments. At the same time, controlled infrasound stimulation has shown potential as an adjunct modality in bone repair and tissue regeneration, highlighting its dual capacity as both a biological stressor and a possible therapeutic tool. Overall, existing data indicate that infrasound may be harmful at chronic exposure depending on intensity and frequency, yet beneficial when precisely regulated. Future research should standardize exposure metrics, refine measurement technologies, and clarify dose–response relationships to better define the health risks and therapeutic applications of infrasound.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores a sustainable synthesis route for FAU-type zeolite X using acid-treated ladle slag as a silicon source and waste aluminum cans as an alternative aluminum precursor. Conventional zeolite synthesis relies on high-purity reagents, which are costly and environmentally intensive to produce. Previous research has rarely addressed the valorization of ladle slag and metallic aluminum waste for zeolite formation, leaving their potential largely unexplored. The study focuses on the effective utilization of industrial and post-consumer wastes—acid-treated ladle slag and aluminum cans—as precursors for FAU-type NaX zeolite, demonstrating their feasibility as alternative silicon and aluminum sources. Here, zeolite X was synthesized hydrothermally from treated slag combined with either dissolved aluminum cans and commercial sodium aluminate at 90 °C for 6 h. FAU-type zeolite X was successfully synthesized using both aluminum sources, with a SiO2/Al2O3 ratio of approximately 1.4. The results demonstrate that waste-derived precursors can effectively replace conventional chemicals, yielding predominantly NaX zeolite with high crystallinity and minor NaA impurity (as observed by XRD), with experimental yields of 1.47 g for aluminum cans and 1.266 g for sodium aluminate. The obtained zeolite X samples were structurally and texturally characterized by XRD, FTIR, XRF, BET surface area analysis, and thermogravimetric analysis (TG).",

    "Abstract": "This article explores Vsevolod Meyerhold’s biomechanics as an avant-garde theatrical and anthropotechnical method developed to forge new subjectivity and redefine roles in post-revolutionary society. It delves into early Soviet avant-garde theatre’s emphasis on movement as a core expressive tool and the transformation of the actor’s body into a precise instrument for calibrated gestures. Methodologically, the research is based on cultural studies examining relations between art processes and the functioning of social institutions. The article also analyzes a significant corpus of recently published archival materials related to Meyerhold’s development of biomechanical elements and details the structure of Meyerhold’s exercises and their role in enhancing motor skills and expressiveness on stage. The purpose of this article is to interpret biomechanics in the socio-cultural context of early Soviet times, while also examining it as a complex system transcending mere theatrical training. The key finding of the article is that the development of biomechanics encompassed not only theatrical, scientific, and social aspects but also proved close to the ideas of philosophy of Russian anthropocosmism.",

    "Abstract": "Sentiment analysis of Arabic text, particularly on social media platforms, presents a formidable set of unique challenges that stem from the language’s complex morphology, its numerous dialectal variations, and the frequent and nuanced use of emojis to convey emotional context. This paper presents SiAraSent, a hybrid framework that integrates traditional text representations, emoji-aware features, and deep contextual embeddings based on Arabic transformers. Starting from a strong and fully interpretable baseline built on Term Frequency–Inverse Definition Frequency (TF–IDF)-weighted character and word N-grams combined with emoji embeddings, we progressively incorporate SinaTools for linguistically informed preprocessing and AraBERT for contextualized encodings. The framework is evaluated on a large-scale dataset of 58,751 Arabic tweets labeled for sentiment polarity. Our design works within four experimental configurations: (1) a baseline traditional machine learning architecture that employs TF-IDF, N-grams, and emoji features with an Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier; (2) an Large-language Model (LLM) feature extraction approach that leverages deep contextual embeddings from the pre-trained AraBERT model; (3) a novel hybrid fusion model that concatenates traditional morphological features, AraBERT embeddings, and emoji-based features into a high-dimensional vector; and (4) a fully fine-tuned AraBERT model specifically adapted for the sentiment classification task. Our experiments demonstrate the remarkable efficacy of our proposed framework, with the fine-tuned AraBERT architecture achieving an accuracy of 93.45%, a significant 10.89% improvement over the best traditional baseline.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the effects of terroir on the sensory expression of two major white grape varieties, Fetească albă and Sauvignon blanc. The experimental design included wines from eleven wineries distributed across the main Romanian wine-growing regions—Banat, Dobrogea, Moldova, Muntenia–Oltenia, and Transylvania—covering a wide range of altitudes (75–400 m), latitudes (21.6–28.4°), and contrasting soil types (chernozems, alluvial soils, luvaceous and clay-illuvial brown soils) over two climatically distinct vintages (2019 and 2021). Volatile profiling was performed by GC–MS, and aroma relevance was assessed using odor activity values (OAVs) and weighted aromatic scores, while sensory attributes were integrated through structured sensory evaluation. Esters and thiols emerged as the dominant contributors to varietal aroma expression. Sensory aggregation revealed clear winery-dependent differences, whereas vintage effects were moderate, with 2021 wines displaying a more pronounced fruity–floral profile compared to 2019. Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) identified grape variety as the strongest discriminant factor, surpassing vintage, and confirmed distinct regional sensory identities. The integrated OAV–sensory–LDA framework demonstrates the defining role of terroir in shaping aromatic structure, enabling robust varietal typicity assessment and regional differentiation across Romanian wine-growing areas.",

    "Abstract": "Age-related chronic, low-grade inflammation, known as inflammaging, contributes to tissue damage and disease. In the lungs, inflammaging leads to abnormal tissue remodeling, reduced function, and decreased immunity. A key factor in inflammaging is declining acetylcholine signaling, which normally suppresses inflammation and promotes tissue repair. We tested whether increasing acetylcholine responsiveness could reverse age-related lung damage. Aged mice were treated with donepezil to increase acetylcholine availability. After six months, blood oxygen saturation and voluntary activity were significantly improved. Histologically, treated mice showed a reversal of alveolar enlargement (a hallmark of emphysema) and complete restoration of elastic fibers. Donepezil treatment also dramatically increased bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) formation. iBALT is the repository of tissue-resident memory lymphocytes, including memory cholinergic lymphocytes that produce acetylcholine to suppress inflammation during secondary infections. The age-related loss of iBALT contributes to the increased risks associated with respiratory infection in the elderly. This indicates that age-related lung function and respiratory immune deficits can be modulated by improving acetylcholine signaling. Repurposing an approved medication provides a direct pathway to clinical application for improving respiratory health and infection resistance during aging.",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and common primary brain tumor, with a median survival of less than a year after diagnosis. γδ T lymphocytes are immune cells that can migrate to tumors and induce malignant cells’ apoptosis. Our previous in silico studies showed that higher γδ T-cell infiltration in GBM correlates with better patient survival, and in vitro experiments showed that GMB supernatants promote an antitumoral profile in γδ T cells. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play a critical role in cell communication, particularly in tumor microenvironment modulation. Here, we studied the mechanisms responsible for γδ T lymphocyte activation by GBM-derived EVs, together with the effect of these EVs on γδ T cells from GBM patients. For that, γδ T cells were purified from peripheral blood, and EVs were obtained from U251 cell supernatants by differential centrifugation. After EV characterization, we evaluated the γδ T cell–EV interaction and γδ T-cell modulation by EVs. Results showed that EVs induced an increase in CD69 expression, cytotoxicity, and TNF-α and IFN-γ production in γδ T cells in a MIC-dependent mechanism. These results provide valuable insights for developing targeted immunotherapies in GBM patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Juniperus macrocarpa Sm. is a key shrub species of the Mediterranean coastal dune systems. The species, considered vulnerable, often shows fragmented or declining populations due to coastal erosion and human pressure. However, along a protected stretch of the northern Tuscany coast it displays an opposite trend, with an apparent expansion of the species. Methods: To assess recent population dynamics, we compared high-resolution aerial imagery from 2013 with UAV orthophotos from 2023 across two dune systems of the Migliarino–San Rossore–Massaciuccoli Regional Park (Italy). The dune profile was divided into three belts (B1: shifting dune; B2: consolidated grassland dune; B3: consolidated juniper dune). A total of 368 plots (10 × 10 m) were analyzed to quantify temporal changes in individual abundance and vegetation cover. Results: Over the ten-year period, total abundance increased from 99 to 342 individuals (+245%) at Lecciona and from 117 to 324 individuals (+177%) at Marina di Vecchiano. Mean cover per plot increased significantly at both sites (overall p &lt; 0.001), with the strongest proportional increases recorded in the seaward belts (B1: up to +1220% in abundance and +4500% in cover) revealing a clear shift from an inner-dune concentration in 2013 to a more homogeneous spatial distribution across the entire dune system in 2023. Conclusions: Under conditions of low anthropogenic disturbance, shoreline stability, or geomorphological progradation, J. macrocarpa is able to expand well beyond its recognized ecological niche. These findings demonstrate the central role of geomorphological and disturbance regimes in driving coastal dune vegetation dynamics and highlight the need for adaptive, site-specific management strategies for the long-term conservation of priority habitat 2250/EUNIS N1B.",

    "Abstract": "The G protein-coupled galanin receptors include three different subtypes: galanin receptor 1, 2 and 3 (GalR1, GalR2, GalR3). The neuropeptide galanin is the principal natural agonist of the galanin receptors, the so-called galaninergic system. Galanin-like peptide and spexin have also been identified as natural ligands of the galanin receptors. Galanin receptors are widely expressed in the brain; however, they can be found in other tissues, such as the skeletal muscle, the heart, and the gastrointestinal tract. The galaninergic system regulates diverse biological processes, including feeding behavior, neuroprotection, learning, memory, cardiovascular and renal function, and nociception. Its dysregulation is associated with various diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, depression, and cancer. The stimulation of GalR1 and GalR3 leads to the Gαi/o-type G protein-mediated inhibition of cyclic AMP/protein kinase A, whereas GalR2 stimulation initiates phospholipase C activation via Gαq/11-type G proteins. A galanin-activated β-arrestin-dependent pathway has also been described for GalR2. In this review, we summarize the recent advances concerning galanin receptor signaling, including both the G protein-dependent and -independent pathways. A better understanding of the complex interplay of the signaling molecules, receptors, and various signaling pathways is crucial for the future development of specific agonists with therapeutic potential.",

    "Abstract": "To enhance the bioavailability of hydrophobic nobiletin (NOB), this study constructed nanoparticles (LT-NOB) via self-assembly of lysozyme and tannic acid (TA). The multivalent weak interaction network between TA and lysozyme effectively encapsulated amorphous NOB, inhibiting crystallization. The optimized LT-NOB exhibited a size of 212 nm, high encapsulation efficiency (89.5%), and drug loading (47.25%). Cellular uptake was significantly improved, primarily through macropinocytosis, followed by lysosomal escape and endoplasmic reticulum targeting. In Caco-2 and co-culture models, LT-NOB enhanced mucosal permeation by 75% and 50%, respectively, compared to free NOB. This work elucidates a robust strategy for stabilizing amorphous drugs and promoting their intestinal absorption, providing a foundation for advanced nanodrug delivery.",

    "Abstract": "Kinetic models are important tools for guiding the design and optimization of lipase-catalyzed processes. These processes follow the Ping Pong bi bi mechanism, for which mechanistic kinetic equations can be derived. However, when there are several competing reactions, fully mechanistic models contain a large number of parameters, making it difficult to obtain reliable estimates, so simplified models are necessary. We present a two-step approach to developing semi-mechanistic models of such processes. The first step involves the estimation of the selectivities of the enzyme, using profiles for the reaction species plotted against the degree of reaction, while the second step involves empirical fitting to the same data, but plotted as a function of time. We demonstrate this two-step approach through four case studies based on the literature data for the lipase-catalyzed esterification of fatty acids with trimethylolpropane to produce biolubricants. The semi-mechanistic models were able to describe the data well. Our approach has the advantage of allowing selectivities to be estimated without confounding effects from phenomena such as enzyme denaturation and inhibition. It therefore provides a promising framework for developing models of enzyme-catalyzed processes that obey Ping Pong bi bi kinetics.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Older adult falls during step negotiation result in higher injury rates compared to level ground falls. Previous research on discrete events during step negotiations may not capture important age-related changes. Curve analysis techniques enable assessment of an entire time series and may further advance the understanding of older adult falls during step negotiation. The purpose of the current study was to investigate lower extremity kinematics during transition step negotiation in older women with fall history compared to young women using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Methods: 15 older female adults with a fall history and 15 young female adults participated in the study. Participants performed walking trials along a 5.5 m raised walkway, descended a 17 cm step and continued walking 3 m. Data was processed from lead limb toe-off prior to the step, through lead limb weight acceptance of the transition step. SPM was used to perform independent t-test analysis of the three-dimensional lower extremity time series. Results: The older faller group showed significantly decreased lead hip abduction (9–19% of step negotiation, mean difference: 3.74°, p = 0.045), increased lead knee flexion (65–80% of step negotiation, mean difference: 5.8°, p = 0.012), and increased trail limb hip adduction (91–100% of step negotiation, mean difference: 3.92°, p = 0.046). Conclusions: The older faller group showed altered hip joint angles in the frontal plane and knee joint angles in the sagittal plane during early swing and late weight acceptance phases, which may reflect compensatory strategies for reduced strength and/or balance. Curve analysis provides additional insight into age-related kinematic changes during step negotiation that may be related to older adult fall risk.",

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer remains the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women worldwide, with outcomes strongly dependent on stage at detection. Conventional imaging modalities such as mammography, ultrasound and MRI are limited by reduced sensitivity in dense breasts, radiation exposure, high cost and restricted availability in low-resource settings. This review critically examines microwave imaging (MWI) as a non-invasive, radiation-free and an emerging resource-efficient breast imaging modality that exploits dielectric contrast between healthy and malignant breast tissues. We first summarise experimental and clinical evidence on breast dielectric properties and their implications for numerical phantoms and device design. We then review passive, active (tomographic and radar-based) and hybrid MWI systems, including key clinical prototypes such as SAFE, MammoWave, MARIA and Wavelia, and analyse associated image-reconstruction algorithms from classical inverse scattering to advanced beamforming, Huygens-based methods and AI based reconstruction. Finally, we discuss outstanding challenges—tissue heterogeneity, calibration, hardware constraints and computational complexity—and identify future directions including AI-assisted reconstruction, multimodal hybrid imaging and large-scale clinical validation needed to translate MWI into routine breast cancer screening and diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Radiation therapy is a critical treatment modality for craniofacial tumors and metastatic lesions, particularly gliomas. While effective, it poses significant risks of neurotoxicity, which adversely affects patient quality of life. This review aims to explore the mechanisms underlying radiation-induced neurodegeneration (RIN) and its clinical implications, focusing on the interplay between radiation exposure, cognitive decline, and potential therapeutic strategies. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted, analyzing studies on radiation effects on the central nervous system (CNS), including mechanisms of injury, clinical outcomes, and emerging therapeutic approaches. Key areas of interest included the role of inflammation, vascular damage, neurogenesis impairment, and genetic predispositions in the context of radiation therapy. Results: The findings indicate that radiation induces a complex cascade of neurobiological changes, including vascular injury, microglial activation, and neurogenesis dysfunction, leading to cognitive impairments. The severity of these effects is influenced by patient age, treatment regimens, and individual genetic factors. Additionally, emerging biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid may provide insights into individual susceptibility to radiation-induced neurotoxicity. Therapeutic strategies such as neuroprotective agents, anti-inflammatory treatments, and advanced radiation techniques show promise in mitigating cognitive decline. Conclusions: Radiation-induced neurodegeneration is a multifaceted process with significant implications for patients undergoing radiation therapy. The underlying mechanisms include endothelial cell apoptosis leading to blood–brain barrier breakdown, chronic inflammation, and the destruction of neural progenitor cells in the hippocampus, which collectively trigger cognitive decline and progressive degeneration. A better understanding of these mechanisms is crucial for developing effective preventative and therapeutic strategies. Future research should focus on identifying high-risk patients and exploring innovative approaches to minimize cognitive impacts while maximizing the efficacy of radiation treatment.",

    "Abstract": "The demand for rapid and highly sensitive sensing technologies is increasing across diverse fields, including precise disease diagnosis, early-stage screening, and real-time environmental monitoring. Field-effect transistor (FET)-based sensing platforms have shown tremendous potential for detecting target molecules at extremely low concentrations, owing to their ultrahigh sensitivity, label-free and amplification-free operation, and rapid response. In recent years, the rapid advancement of nucleic acid probe design and interfacial engineering has markedly accelerated the development of FET sensors, leading to the emergence of nucleic acid-based FET (NA-FET) biosensors. Beyond their fundamental role in nucleic acid detection, the integration of nucleic acid aptamers and framework nucleic acids has greatly expanded NA-FET biosensors’ applicability to a wide range of analytes and multiplexed detection. At the same time, advances in semiconductor materials have endowed the NA-FET biosensor with highly efficient signal transduction and diverse device architectures, enabling successful proof-of-concept demonstrations for various clinically and environmentally relevant molecular biomarkers. Furthermore, the integration into portable, wearable, and implantable devices has laid a solid foundation for their future development into real-world applications. This review summarizes recent cutting-edge progress in NA-FET biosensors, highlights key design strategies and performance improvements, and discusses current challenges, future development directions, and their prospects for practical applications.",

    "Abstract": "Exposure to violence (physical, domestic, or sexual assault) increases risk for alcohol problems and alcohol use disorder (AUD), consistent with self-medication and drinking-to-cope theories of alcohol use, which posit that some individuals may misuse alcohol to alleviate distress associated with trauma. Yet how violence exposure and coping motives interact to influence objective AUD risk markers remains unclear. Emerging evidence suggests that trauma type affects psychiatric outcomes, but its role in moderating AUD risk via coping motives remains unknown. We examined these gaps in the literature in a cohort of youth (ages 16–19; n = 157) over-sampled for violence exposure. Participants completed a structured trauma interview and an assessment of drinking motives. A total of 60 participants reported experiencing sexual assault (SA), 54 physical assault (PA), and 32 domestic violence (DV). AUD risk was captured using the alcohol cue reactivity paradigm. Participants were exposed to images of alcoholic beverages, high-calorie foods (reward-related control), and neutral objects. The late positive potential (LPP), an event-related potential captured via electroencephalogram, was used to index cue reactivity. We ran two linear regression analyses to assess the relationship between trauma type and coping motives to drink on LPP to alcohol and food cues (&gt;neutral). For alcohol cues, there was a significant SA and coping interaction. At high levels of coping motivations, SA was associated with enhanced LPP to alcohol cues. At low levels of coping motivations there was no association. No effects were observed for food cues. Our results demonstrate that heightened coping motives to drink are associated with enhanced alcohol cue reactivity among SA victims, indicating increased vulnerability for AUD risk.",

    "Abstract": "In the context of the ongoing green transformation in the construction industry, this research presents a comprehensive economic assessment of emission reduction in residential buildings from the perspective of carbon trading. The assessment accounts for energy saving revenue, emission trading revenue, economic cost, and environmental cost. By adopting two dynamic economic indicators—Net Present Value (NPV) and Dynamic Payback Period (DPP)—a dedicated economic evaluation model for residential building emission reduction is developed. A case study of a residential building shows that roof retrofits deliver the highest NPV, owing to their lower costs and significant emission reduction benefits. Although external walls achieve the highest carbon reduction per unit area, their high costs mean they are ranked second in terms of NPV. Moreover, the introduction of a carbon trading mechanism can generate additional value of approximately 87,377.08 CNY and shorten the payback period by 0.83 years, highlighting its crucial role in advancing the low-carbon transition of the construction industry. However, current emission reduction efforts still face challenges such as a relatively low NPV and an extended payback period. To enhance the investment value and market competitiveness of such projects, it is essential to reduce emission reduction costs and increase emission reduction benefits.",

    "Abstract": "A novel type of ultra-high-performance concrete–normal concrete (UHPC-NC) superimposed sandwich slab is introduced, which eliminates the need for conventional longitudinal reinforcement. This sandwich slab consists of a prefabricated thin UHPC layer at the bottom, a cast-in-place NC layer at the top, and an extruded polystyrene foam core that provides both acoustic and thermal insulation. The resulting lightweight composite sandwich structure is integrated with web walls reinforced by a three-dimensional truss reinforcement system. The flexural performance is examined through four-point bending tests and compared with that of a fully UHPC sandwich slab of identical structural configuration and casting progress. Relative to the fully UHPC slab, the UHPC-NC slab demonstrates superior flexural structural integrity, significantly reduces costs and improves construction efficiency. The ductility coefficient of the UHPC-NC slab reaches 3.23, which is superior to the UHPC slab. This indicates that it has a stronger collaborative working ability with the rebars and the compressed concrete. Comprehensive analytical, numerical, and experimental investigations into the flexural behavior of the proposed UHPC-NC sandwich slab yield accurate evaluation of cracking and ultimate load capacities, thereby offering valuable guidance for the engineering application of this innovative superimposed sandwich slab system.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most prevalent form of malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related fatalities. In clinical practice, metastatic sites are identified on a case-by-case basis. ALK rearrangements are detected in 3–5% of NSCLC cases and are known to have a tendency (tropism) to metastasize to the brain. Methods: Data from 81 ALK-positive and 91 ALK-negative metastatic NSCLC patients were retrospectively analyzed. Systemic markers, including HALP score, NLR, PLR, LMR, and LDH, were calculated from blood tests at the time of metastasis. Optimal cut-off values were determined using ROC analysis. Survival outcomes and prognostic factors were assessed using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analyses. Results: ALK-positive patients were significantly associated with female gender (p = 0.002), non-smoking status (p = 0.001), adenocarcinoma histology (p = 0.001), and a higher incidence of brain metastases (p = 0.001). In univariate analysis, age, time to metastasis, liver metastasis, and NLR were prognostic for survival. Crucially, multivariate analysis identified liver metastasis as an independent predictor of poor prognosis (HR = 1.618; 95% CI: 1.050–2.494; p = 0.029), indicating a 61.8% increased risk of death or progression. While inflammation markers (NLR, HALP, PLR, LMR) did not predict metastasis to specific sites, elevated LDH levels were significantly associated with liver metastasis (p = 0.007). Conclusion: ALK-positive NSCLC demonstrates a marked CNS tropism; however, liver metastasis remains a more critical adverse prognostic factor than brain metastasis in real-world settings. While routine inflammation markers showed limited utility in predicting site-specific metastasis, LDH levels correlated significantly with liver involvement. Aggressive management strategies are warranted for ALK-positive patients presenting with liver metastases.",

    "Abstract": "Hematologic malignancies, including leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma, are diseases of older adults (age ≥ 60 years). Treatment decisions in older adults with cancer are heavily influenced by patient fitness: the ability of an individual patient to tolerate the off-target effects of anti-cancer therapy. Sarcopenia, defined as low muscle mass and strength, is increasingly recognized as an important marker of fitness. Furthermore, sarcopenia is known to be modifiable with nutrition and exercise interventions in older adults without cancer, but such evidence is limited for patients with cancer. Much of the literature on sarcopenia in older adults with cancer has focused on patients with solid tumors. However, there is an increasing body of literature on the impact of sarcopenia in older adults with hematologic malignancies. In this comprehensive review, we attempt to (i) describe the most up-to-date diagnostic criteria and diagnostic approach to sarcopenia, (ii) summarize the prognostic impact of sarcopenia among older adults with hematologic malignancies, (iii) discuss the proposed mechanisms of sarcopenia and its pathogenesis, (iv) review the evidence for interventions targeting sarcopenia, and (v) provide future directions for the advancement of sarcopenia management among older adults with hematologic malignancies.",

This study aims to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs), and enriched pathways associated with CVAEs related to CFZ or BTZ-based treatment. Methods: Baseline germline DNA methylation profiles from 79 MM patients (49 on CFZ and 30 on BTZ) in the Prospective Study of Cardiac Events During Proteasome Inhibitor Therapy (PROTECT) were analyzed. Epigenome-wide analyses were performed within each group, followed by meta-analyses to identify signals common to CVAEs associated with both medicines. Results: Four DMPs were significantly associated with CFZ-CVAEs, including cg15144237 within ENSG00000224400 (p = 9.45 × 10−10), cg00927646 within TBX3 (p = 9.78 × 10−8), and cg10965131 within WDR86 (p = 1.00 × 10−7). One DMR was identified in the FAM166B region (p = 5.46 × 10−7). There was no evidence of any DMPs in BTZ-treated patients, however two DMPs and one DMR reached a suggestive level of significance (p &lt; 1.00 × 10−5): cg09666417 in DNAJC18 (p = 3.41 × 10−7) and cg12987761 in USP18 (p = 5.00 × 10−7), and a DMR mapped to the WDR86/WDR86-AS1 region (p = 8.11 × 10−8). Meta-analysis did not find any significant DMPs, with the top CpG being cg17933807 in GNL2 (p = 7.38 × 10−5). Pathway enrichment analyses identified peroxisome, MAPK, Rap1, adherens junction, phospholipase D, autophagy, and aldosterone-related pathways to be implicated in CVAEs. Conclusions: Our study identified distinct DMPs, DMRs, and pathways enrichment associated with CVAE, suggesting epigenetic contributors to CVAEs and supporting the need for larger validation studies.",

Moreover, the respective symmetric products with identical aryl groups were also present. The outcome was similar, when α-amino-α-aryl-methyl-phosphonates were condensed with benzaldehyde and diethyl phosphite. The products were analyzed by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy.

    "Abstract": "The pursuit of sustainable ammonia production has accelerated the development of electrocatalytic pathways capable of operating under ambient conditions with renewable electricity. Recent studies have revealed that the efficiency and selectivity of both electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) and nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) are not governed solely by catalyst composition, but by the synergistic interplay among electrolyte identity, interfacial solvation structure, and catalyst architecture. Hydrated cations such as Li+ profoundly reshape the electric double layer, polarize interfacial water, and lower activation barriers for key proton–electron transfer steps, thereby redefining the electrolyte as an active promoter. Parallel advances in structural engineering, including alloying, heteroatom doping, controlled defect formation, and nanoscale morphological control, have enabled the optimization of intermediate adsorption energies while simultaneously suppressing competing hydrogen evolution. In addition, the emergence of metal–organic-framework (MOF)-derived single-atom catalysts has demonstrated that atomically dispersed transition-metal centers anchored within dynamically adaptable matrices can deliver exceptional Faradaic efficiencies, high turnover rates, and long-term operational durability. These developments highlight a unified strategy in which electrolyte–catalyst coupling, rational structural modification, and atomic-scale design principles converge to enable predictable and high-performance ammonia electrosynthesis. This review integrates mechanistic insights across these domains and outlines future directions for translating molecular-level understanding into scalable technologies for green ammonia production.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, the novel electrochemical in situ synthesis process for H2O2, in which oxygen is in situ generated from water electrolysis powered by photovoltaic renewable energy and Mg2+ ions is added, is constructed by an ordinary Pt anode and a graphite or carbon felt cathode in a green, safe, low-cost, and high-yield way. The results show that the yields of hydrogen peroxide (YHP) for Mg(NO3)2 and MgSO4 are all higher than that for light MgO and are above 19.8 mg/L. The optimal Mg2+ concentration of 30 mg/L, pH of 1, current density of 30 mA/cm2, and cathodic immersion depth of 50 mm is determined, respectively. For solutions containing Mg2+, their YHPs are consistently higher than that of the Mg2+-free solution and properly adding Mg2+ into solutions can improve YHP. YHP for carbon felt cathodes is much higher than that for graphite plates, and the fluffy spatial structure of the cathode is beneficial to synthesis of H2O2. Additionally, YHP for pure oxygen blown into solution is the highest and 494.2 mg/L. Even if solar illumination intensity is very low, its YHP can reach to the same yield as high solar illumination intensity, too. In the meantime, the in situ synthesizing mechanism of H2O2 is suggested. Finally, their energy consumption and actual energy utilization efficiency are analyzed. The used method is feasible for the novel in situ synthesis of hydrogen peroxide.",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer remains the most lethal gynecological malignancy, largely due to its early dissemination and extensive peritoneal metastasis. The tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly tumor-associated macrophages, promotes this invasive phenotype; however, the precise molecular effectors linking immune-to-tumor signaling remain unclear. We identified FRY, a microtubule-binding protein previously uncharacterized in ovarian pathology, as a critical mediator of macrophage-driven invasion. We observed that conditioned medium from ovarian cancer-stimulated macrophages (OCM) robustly induced FRY expression in ovarian cancer cells. Clinically, elevated FRY levels correlate with advanced tumor stage and poor patient survival. Functionally, FRY knockdown significantly abrogated OCM-induced invasion without affecting cell viability, highlighting its specific role in motility. Mechanistically, FRY facilitates epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and acts as an essential downstream effector of the PI3K/AKT signaling cascade; notably, FRY was required for AKT1-driven invasive behaviors. Furthermore, we identified the transcription factor NFIX as a key regulator of FRY expression. Macrophage-derived signals upregulate NFIX, which directly regulates FRY transcription. Pharmacological inhibition of the CXCR1/2 axis with reparixin effectively blocked OCM-mediated induction of both NFIX and FRY, suggesting that chemokine signaling initiates this pro-invasive loop. Collectively, these findings suggest that FRY is a macrophage-driven mediator of invasion and underscore its potential relevance in ovarian cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Local governments play a critical role in advancing climate change mitigation under national carbon neutrality strategies; however, practical mechanisms for policy learning and collaboration remain limited. This study analyzes the Kyoto Roundtable, a transdisciplinary dialogue platform designed to support municipalities toward decarbonization in Japan. Based on a policy-learning framework co-designed with frontrunner municipalities, we implemented five roundtable sessions involving municipal officers and researchers. Analysis of workshop discussions, action-planning sheets, and participant surveys illustrates how structured dialogue supports policy learning and coordination. The findings indicate that inter-municipal networks and sustained science–policy dialogue play a crucial role in motivating local climate policy development. Mutual learning and knowledge exchange within the roundtable enhanced participants’ engagement and capacity to adapt policies. The interaction between horizontal inter-municipal collaboration and vertical support from supramunicipal and national governments contributed to early-stage policy diffusion. These findings suggest that transdisciplinary dialogue platforms can function as critical infrastructure for scaling local decarbonization by sustaining policy learning and inter-municipal collaboration.",

    "Abstract": "Cities are among the major consumers of environmental resources and contribute significantly to the degradation of many ecosystems. For this reason, the European Union is prioritising the transformation of the role of European cities to become key actors in enabling sustainable and efficient urban systems. Part of this effort is enacted through the Mission “Cities,” that guides cities in developing Climate City Contracts (CCC), which are innovative governance instruments that outline municipalities’ collaborative and systemic plans to reach climate neutrality. This article examines how 102 Mission Cities across Europe plan to reach climate neutrality by 2030, by analysing the selection of typologies of actions included in their CCCs. Results reveal distinct regional patterns in how municipalities design their portfolios of climate actions in key topics: an integrated and diversified combination of sectoral measures and governance innovations in Northern and Western Europe, a focus on upgrading core infrastructures in Central and Eastern Europe, and prioritisation of interventions in mobility and the Built Environment in Southern Europe. These findings provide insights for policy and planning strategies, and highlight countries that progress faster in specific topics and those that still face relevant barriers.",

    "Abstract": "Achieving environmentally friendly, green, and non-toxic marine antifouling has long been a development goal of the modern coatings industry. However, in complex marine environments, non-toxic or low-toxic antifouling coatings often have a significantly reduced service life. Therefore, achieving stable antifouling performance on a low-toxic basis has always been a goal in this industry. By using fluorocarbon resin with low surface energy and spraying a well-mixed blend of alkaline earth metal oil-absorbing nanowires and nano zinc oxide particles that is under high pressure, half-embedded into the resin, and infiltrated with alkanes, the antifouling mechanism of these coatings is achieved by the slow release of oily components, creating a long-lasting liquid–liquid interface to separate biofouling from the coating. Thanks to this antifouling mechanism, the sample maintains a water contact angle of 100–110° for 42 days in static seawater, achieves over 98% resistance to bacterial adhesion, and reaches 99.9% resistance to protein and algae adhesion. This study provides a novel and promising solution for the strict implementation of low-toxic and harmless antifouling.",

    "Abstract": "The increasing need for accurate prediction of geochemical anomalies requires methods capable of capturing complex spatial patterns that traditional approaches often fail to represent adequately. For N datasets of the form (Xi,Yi) representing the geographic coordinates of sampling points and Ci denoting the geochemical measurement, training multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) presents a challenge. The low informativeness of the input features and their weak correlation with the target variable result in excessively simplified predictions. Analysis of a baseline model trained only on geographic coordinates showed that, while the loss function converges rapidly, the resulting values become overly “compressed” and fail to reflect the actual concentration range. To address this, a preprocessing method based on anisotropy was developed to enhance the correlation between input and output variables. This approach constructs, for each prediction point, a structured informational model that incorporates the direction and magnitude of spatial variability through sectoral and radial partitioning of the nearest sampling data. The transformed features are then used in a dual-MLP architecture, where the first network produces sectoral estimates, and the second aggregates them into the final prediction. The results show that anisotropic feature transformation significantly improves neural network prediction capabilities in geochemical analysis.",

Trophoblast cell-surface antigen 2 (Trop2), a calcium signal transducer, is frequently overexpressed in TNBC (approximately 88% of cases) while exhibiting minimal expression in normal tissues. Its overexpression is significantly associated with tumor invasion, metastasis, and unfavorable prognosis. Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) targeting Trop2 have demonstrated significant clinical potential. This article systematically reviews the clinical research progress of Trop2-targeted ADCs, aiming to provide evidence-based insights for improving the prognosis of TNBC patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) increases cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and predisposes individuals to heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), prevalent in T2D, may worsen cardiac remodelling and haemodynamics. This secondary analysis of the DIASTOLIC trial examined the relationship of liver fat to cardiac remodelling in T2D at baseline and after a 12-week intervention or standard care. Methods: Adults with obesity and T2D and matched controls underwent hepatic MRI, cardiac MRI, echocardiography, and adipokine profiling as part of the DIASTOLIC study (NCT02590822). Participants with T2D were randomised to supervised exercise, a low-calorie meal-replacement plan (MRP), or routine care for 12 weeks. A baseline case–control and then pre- and post-analyses in those with T2D were performed. Associations between changes in liver fat and cardiovascular measures were assessed using correlation and adjusted generalised linear models. Results: At baseline, 81 T2D and 35 healthy controls were compared, and 76 subjects with T2D completed the trial. Participants with T2D had ~4× higher hepatic fat and adverse haemodynamics. The MRP arm achieved the greatest reductions in BMI, blood pressure, dysglycaemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic fat (−8.9%), with favourable adipokine changes. Overall, hepatic fat loss was associated with reductions in cardiac index and stroke volume and with additional reductions in end-diastolic volume in the MRP arm, independent of BMI. Conclusions: In T2D, hepatic fat is strongly linked to pathological haemodynamic profiles. Intensive caloric restriction achieves substantial hepatic fat loss and normalisation of hyperdynamic cardiovascular physiology independent of weight loss, identifying hepatic steatosis as a potential therapeutic target for early cardiovascular risk reduction.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms (SPN) and pancreatoblastoma (PB) have a low overall incidence but represent the most common pancreatic tumors in childhood. Currently, there is a lack of systematic descriptions of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) features for these two tumors in pediatric populations. This study aims to retrospectively analyze and compare the CEUS characteristics of SPN and PB to explore key imaging differentiation points. Methods: This retrospective study collected data on 22 patients with solid pseudopapillary neoplasms and pancreatic blastomas of the pancreas who were pathologically diagnosed at a children’s hospital between September 2019 and May 2025. The ultrasound contrast-enhanced imaging findings for both tumor types were summarized and analyzed. Two physicians with different levels of experience performed qualitative analysis of the contrast-enhanced images, while quantitative analysis was conducted using time–intensity curve (TIC) analysis software. Results: This study included a total of 22 pediatric patients (19 with SPN and 3 with PB). Significant differences existed between the two groups in age (13.51 years vs. 2.94 years) and Ki-67 index (5.00% vs. 30.00%). Qualitative analysis revealed high heterogeneity in SPN enhancement patterns, with capsular enhancement with cystic components being the most common (42.11%). All PBs (100%) consistently demonstrated the “disorganized nourishing vessels” sign. Quantitative analysis revealed that PBs exhibited numerically higher IMAX values (179.84% vs. 60.56%) and faster WoR trends (773.88 vs. 275.38). Inter-observer consistency analysis supported measurement reliability (key parameters ICC &gt; 0.80). Conclusions: This preliminary study indicates differences in CEUS characteristics between pediatric SPN and PB; PB tends to exhibit rapid, high enhancement with chaotic feeding vessels and rapid washout, whereas SPN more commonly presents with moderate, slow enhancement patterns, often accompanied by features associated with cystic components. These findings provide new hemodynamic clues for their imaging differentiation. Given the extremely small sample size of PB cases, the above conclusions should be regarded as preliminary hypotheses awaiting validation in future large-scale studies.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The majority of cleft palate patients have been reported to suffer from otitis media with effusion (OME). The improvement of velopharyngeal function (VPF) after palatoplasty might be evidence for the improvement of the function of the Eustachian tube. The improvement of the function of Eustachian tube by palatoplasty has been reported to be effective for the treatment of OME simultaneously with the insertion of a ventilation tube into the tympanic membrane. There are only a few reports that clearly show the association between improvement of VPF and improvement of OME after palatoplasty. In this study, we discussed whether the improvement of VPF after palatoplasty in cleft palate patients with OME improved OME. Methods: Twenty-six patients with cleft palate were included in the study. We retrospectively extracted the information of cleft type, gender, surgical technique, and presence of OME risk factors from electronic medical records. We also investigated the recurrence of OME and the improvement level of VPF at 36 months postoperatively. OME was assessed based on the otolaryngologist’s findings in electronic medical records, with a good prognosis group with no symptom of OME, or a recurrence group with prolonged or recurrent OME. Results: At 36 months after palatoplasty, 19 of 23 patients (82.6%) were in the OME good prognosis group and four (17.4%) were in the OME recurrence group. The rate of patients with recurrent OME did not differ significantly by the degree of improvement of VPF. This study indicated that clear association between other risk factors for OME and OME recurrence could not be shown. Conclusion: We observed that most patients with cleft palate who underwent palatoplasty showed a good prognosis for OME at 36 months after surgery. However, further studies are needed to investigate the impact of different surgical techniques on the improvement of OME and the degree to which VPF improves, as well as the effect of each OME risk factor.",

    "Abstract": "Kolmogorov complexity of a finite binary word reflects both algorithmic structure and the empirical distribution of symbols appearing in the word. Words with symbol frequencies far from one half belong to smaller combinatorial classes and therefore appear less complex under the standard definition. In this paper, an entropy-normalized complexity measure is introduced that divides the Kolmogorov complexity of a word by the empirical entropy of its observed distribution of zeros and ones. This adjustment isolates intrinsic descriptive complexity from the purely combinatorial effect of symbol imbalance. For Martin–Löf random sequences under constructive exchangeable measures, the adjusted complexity grows linearly and converges to one. A pathological construction shows that regularity of the underlying measure is essential. The proposed framework connects Kolmogorov complexity, empirical entropy, and randomness in a natural manner and suggests applications in randomness testing and in the analysis of structured binary data.",

    "Abstract": "Outdoor education (OE) represents an established approach to connecting learning with real-world contexts and supporting sustainability-related competencies. The aim of this study was to examine how Slovenian lower secondary natural science and biology teachers perceive and implement OE, as well as which factors influence its use in school practice. In Slovenia, natural science is taught as an integrated subject in grades 6–7, while biology is taught as a separate subject from grade 8 onwards; this study therefore included teachers from both instructional contexts. Data were collected using an online questionnaire completed by 108 teachers and analysed using descriptive statistics, correlations analyses, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The results indicate that teachers generally perceive OE as highly beneficial for students, particularly regarding engagement, experiential learning, and environmental awareness, but report obstacles such as limited time, curriculum overload, and large class sizes. These findings provide empirical insight into the gap between curricular intension and classroom practice and may inform policy measures and teacher education programmes aimed at strengthening the systematic integration of OE in Slovenian science teaching.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to identify young school students’ language learning strategies (LLSs) within their diverse socio-linguistic reality. The study was conducted in one elementary school in a peripheral city characterized by a heterogeneous population (Arabs and Jews) and immigrants from various countries who speak multiple languages. The principal of this school opted to introduce young children (Grades 1 and 2) to four languages: Hebrew, as a socially dominant language; Russian and Arabic, as the children’s home languages; and English, as a global language. We used photo elicitation and dialogical conversation to obtain reflections of 11 Arab and Jewish students (Grade 2). Each student was asked to describe the strategies they used to learn a novel language in the classroom and at home. Findings support the appropriateness of Oxford’s taxonomy to young language learners: all LLSs’ categories were reported. This study contributes to our understanding of children’s ability to use LLSs in early primary school. It highlights the leading role of language teachers who seem to mediate by modelling LLSs. Furthermore, it enriches the understanding of how 7–8-year-old learners can use diverse metacognitive LLSs and transfer them across languages. We also found one “child-specific” characteristics of the strategy related to parental involvement.",

    "Abstract": "A sense of belonging in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is often conceptualized primarily through social dimensions, overlooking its disciplinary and epistemological contexts. In chemistry, understanding belonging requires examining how disciplinary culture, values, and norms shape who feels included and who is excluded. This perspective article explores belonging in chemistry (a STEM discipline) as a multidimensional construct, emphasizing the intersections of social, cultural, and epistemic dimensions that influence students’ participation and identity development in chemistry. Through a critical synthesis of literature informed by dominant group theory and decolonization frameworks, this work interrogates how Eurocentric definitions of merit and excellence perpetuate exclusionary practices and constrain the belonging of nondominant groups. The analysis identifies key opportunities in chemistry to support the participation of all and offers asset-based considerations for transforming departmental and instructional practices. We conclude that advancing belonging in chemistry requires reexamining disciplinary norms and adopting new approaches that validate multiple ways of knowing and contributing to the chemical sciences.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, we present a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for the classification of oil palm fresh fruit bunch (FFB) ripeness using RGB images. Unlike conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that learn solely from visual patterns, the proposed PINN integrates a physics-based index—derived from the red-to-green pixel intensity ratio—directly into the network architecture and loss function. This hybrid design embeds wavelength-dependent physical knowledge related to chlorophyll degradation during ripening, enabling the model to learn more robust and generalizable features even with limited and imbalanced training data. The PINN model achieves a peak accuracy of 0.73, outperforming the purely data-driven CNN baseline (0.68) by a margin of 5%. Overall, the PINN demonstrates superior performance in minority-class detection and maintains stable convergence under three different lighting conditions (different light spectra). These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating domain-specific physical insights into deep learning models, offering a promising pathway toward reliable, non-destructive, and automated ripeness assessment for agricultural applications.",

    "Abstract": "The emergence of radio frequency machine learning has significantly propelled the application of deep learning (DL) methods in automatic modulation classification (AMC). However, under non-cooperative scenarios, the performance of DL-based AMC suffers severe performance degradation due to scarce labeled samples and noise interference. To enhance noise robustness in few-shot AMC, this paper proposes a complex-domain autoencoder-based method where a complex-valued noise reduction network (CNRN) is embedded into the AMC framework, jointly extracting complex-valued and temporal features from noisy signals to achieve signal–noise separation. Our framework executes four sequential operations: high-signal-to-noise-ratio (high-SNR) samples are first isolated from limited raw data via unsupervised classification; rotation and cyclic time-shifting operations then augment the sample space; the CNRN is subsequently trained on augmented data; and final AMC classification is implemented through DL-based classifiers. Experimental validation on RML 2016.10a dataset demonstrates: (1) for −20 dB signals, denoising achieves 20.18 dB SNR improvement with 87.74% mean squared error reduction; (2) across the −20 dB to 18 dB range, denoised signals exhibit accuracy improvements of 21.57% under DL-based classifiers. Physical validation further confirms that the proposed method exhibits enhanced noise robustness, demonstrating its practical utility in real-world scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the flow and heat transfer mechanisms of high-temperature air flowing across staggered lined fine tubes in a SABRE-type precooler. Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) was employed to model three-dimensional unsteady flow under constant-property and variable-property air models at inlet temperatures of 400–800 K. The results show that increasing temperature substantially enhances vorticity, turbulent kinetic energy, heat flux, and Nusselt number, while flow separation and pressure drop are intensified. However, when temperature-dependent air properties are incorporated, the wake width increases and the separated shear layers become thicker, while the turbulence/unsteadiness intensity decreases. Consequently, the near-wall shear is reduced and the heat transfer coefficients are lower. Compared with variable-property predictions, constant-property models overestimate the average Nusselt number by 20–40% and the local pressure drop by 40–65%, and they underestimate the air-side temperature drop along the tube rows. These findings demonstrate that real-gas effects significantly alter both aerodynamic resistance and thermal performance. Overall, accurate representation of temperature-dependent air properties is essential for the reliable design, evaluation, and optimization of micro-tube precoolers.",

    "Abstract": "The variability of renewable energy sources, coupled with the decentralised configuration of distributed generation (DG), significantly complicates grid management, necessitating sophisticated visual analytics to enhance power system performance and energy distribution. This paper presents a probabilistic visualisation technique based on polar histograms to identify the dynamic influence zones of DG units by analysing line current flows. The proposed framework explicitly accounts for the probabilistic representation of reverse power flows, which provides an overall view of DG impacts on distribution networks. Quasi-dynamic simulations are conducted on a 33-bus distribution system using DIgSILENT PowerFactory 2020, MATLAB R2020, and Python 3.8. The results demonstrate that the polar histogram approach provides intuitive insights into DG influence, revealing zones of grid-dominated, DG-dominated, and shared interactions. These findings act as a potential practical tool for voltage management, demand balancing, and secure integration of renewable DG units into modern power grids.",

    "Abstract": "This study develops an intelligent real-time diagnostic and forecasting model for photovoltaic (PV) stations operating in the rural regions of Kazakhstan. Field measurements show that in Kazakhstan’s rural conditions, daily temperature fluctuations of 18–27 °C reduce PV output by 10–15%, solar irradiance variations of 800–1100 W/m2 cause an additional 8–12% deviation, and mineral-rich dust accumulation of 20–120 μm results in 3–5% power loss per 10 μm layer. Using the Beer–Lambert–Bouguer law, thermal degradation coefficients, and inverter droop models, the physical–mathematical behavior of PV degradation was described. The hybrid AI model (LSTM + XGBoost + Random Forest) achieved 89–91% accuracy in 24 h forecasting and 88–93% accuracy in fault detection. Overall, the proposed system reduces energy losses by 10–15% and shortens maintenance time by 18–24%, improving the reliability of rural PV stations in Kazakhstan.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Breast cancer (BC) incidence has been increasing rapidly in North Africa, including Morocco, yet evidence regarding modifiable lifestyle factors remains limited. This study aimed to assess the associations between physical activity, sedentary behavior, daily work habits, and BC risk among Moroccan women, addressing an important gap in regional data. Methods: We conducted a case–control study between 2019 and 2023, including 1400 histologically confirmed incident BC cases and 1400 matched controls. Physical activity was assessed across the lifespan, considering type, intensity, and duration. Associations with BC risk were estimated using adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Moderate physical activity was inversely associated with BC risk, showing a clear dose–response relationship. Compared with the lowest physical activity level, the highest quartile showed significantly lower odds of BC (aOR = 0.37 (95% CI: 0.29–0.47). Vigorous physical activity during young adulthood and mid-adulthood was similarly linked to reduced risk. Active daily habits, such as walking and regular stair climbing, were associated with lower odds, whereas frequent occupational fatigue and sweating were linked to increased risk. Conclusions: Our findings highlight a significant inverse association between physical activity and BC risk among Moroccan women. Notably, moderate PA and active daily habits like brisk walking are linked to lower odds of the disease. While these findings support the role of physical activity as an important factor associated with breast cancer prevention, the retrospective design of the study limits causal inference.",

    "Abstract": "Engineered wood is increasingly valued for its use of renewable raw materials, low environmental impact, and good performance characteristics. The wide variety of raw materials used to produce engineered wood requires detailed research to select rational technological production parameters. This paper examines engineered wood produced from furniture-recycling waste and different polyurethane compositions. The factors under analysis include mixture pressure level, binder type, and filler preparation. The effect of the mixture’s pressure level on density, structure, strength, and moisture indicators was evaluated. The pressure levels were 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 MPa. Tests have shown that the mixture pressure level significantly affects compressive strength, absorption, swelling, and structure formation. A rational pressure level of 3.0 MPa was determined. When using this level, there are no voids in the samples. Depending on the binder composition, the resulting compressive strength ranges from 20.5 to 25.6 MPa, water absorption from 7.62 to 10.3 kg/m2, and swelling from 8.65 to 12.6%. At a pressure of 3.5 MPa, the properties of engineered wood improve further, but the binder begins to separate from the mixture. A significant influence of the binder on compressive strength, absorption, and swelling was observed. A detailed kinetic analysis was performed to evaluate changes in sample strength following production. The tests showed that the compressive strength increased markedly 14 days after sample preparation.",

    "Abstract": "Offshore aquaculture requires net cages that remain stable under strong currents and during submersion and emergence operations. In this study, we proposed a submersible net cage structure equipped with vertical buoyancy columns as an alternative to the conventional horizontal floating-frame cage and evaluated its stability using a net geometry and load analysis system (NaLA system). Model-scale cages were tested in a recirculating flume tank at two current velocities, and the three-dimensional cage geometry was reconstructed using the multicamera through direct linear transformation method to validate the simulated cage inclination. The NaLA system accurately reproduced the measured geometry and time-varying inclination. After validation, stability was compared over a range of current velocities by tracking the cage inclination during the emergence phase. When mooring lines were attached to the top of the cage, the conventional floating-frame cage exhibited a smaller inclination than the buoyancy-column cage. However, relocating the mooring attachment point on the columns significantly improved the stability; attaching the moorings near the bottom of the columns generated the smallest final inclination and yielded a higher stability than the conventional cage. The buoyancy columns can outperform those of conventional designs when paired with an appropriate mooring configuration, thus offering a promising structure for applications under harsh offshore conditions.",

    "Abstract": "The contents of biochemical components, such as theanine, tea polyphenols, water extract, and soluble sugar in Hakka stir-fried green tea (HSGT), serve as important indicators reflecting the intrinsic quality of tea leaves. In this study, 171 HSGT samples are collected, and their near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), together with the contents of the four indicators, are determined. The aim is to establish prediction models for these four indicators by extracting multiple features from the NIRS data. First, the NIRS data is preprocessed. Then, multiple features are extracted using competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), adaptive Fourier decomposition (AFD), fast Fourier transform (FFT), continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and band combination (BC). Finally, ridge regression (RR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) models are constructed based on the NIRS features to predict the four indicators. Experimental results show that the model combining multiple features, namely CARS + AFD + BC, delivers the best overall performance. Specifically, the RR model based on multiple features provides the most accurate predictions for theanine, tea polyphenols, and soluble sugar, while the PLSR model performs better for water extract. This study provides a rapid and accurate method for detecting the substance content in HSGT.",

    "Abstract": "Fine-grained food image segmentation is essential for accurate dietary assessment and nutritional analysis, yet remains highly challenging due to ambiguous boundaries, inter-class similarity, and dense layouts of meals containing many different ingredients in real-world settings. Existing methods based solely on CNNs, Transformers, or Mamba architectures often fail to simultaneously preserve fine-grained local details and capture contextual dependencies over long distances. To address these limitations, we propose HDF (Hybrid Decoder for Food Image Segmentation), a novel decoding framework built upon the MambaVision backbone. Our approach first employs a convolution-based feature pyramid network (FPN) to extract multi-stage features from the encoder. These features are then thoroughly fused across scales using a Cross-Layer Mamba module that models inter-level dependencies with linear complexity. Subsequently, an Attention Refinement module integrates global semantic context through spatial–channel reweighting. Finally, a Food Co-occurrence Module explicitly enhances food-specific semantics by learning dynamic co-occurrence patterns among categories, improving segmentation of visually similar or frequently co-occurring ingredients. Evaluated on two widely used, high-quality benchmarks, FoodSeg103 and UEC-FoodPIX Complete, which are standard datasets for fine-grained food segmentation, HDF achieves a 52.25% mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on FoodSeg103 and a 76.16% mIoU on UEC-FoodPIX Complete, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin. These results demonstrate that HDF’s hybrid design and explicit co-occurrence awareness effectively address key challenges in food image segmentation, providing a robust foundation for practical applications in dietary logging, nutritional estimation, and food safety inspection.",

    "Abstract": "The Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KS) equation and its fractional generalizations (FKSs) arise as canonical models for a wide class of nonlinear dissipative–dispersive systems, including thin-film flows, combustion fronts, drift–wave turbulence in plasmas, and chemically reacting media, where shock-like and strongly localized structures play a central role in the dynamics. Despite their apparent simplicity, KS-type models become analytically intractable once higher-order dissipation, geometric effects, and memory (fractional) operators are incorporated, and standard perturbative or transform-based schemes often lead to cumbersome recursive structures, slow convergence, or severe restrictions on the initial data. In this work, a novel direct approximation procedure, referred to as the Tantawy Technique (TT), is developed and implemented to solve and analyze planar fractional KS-type equations and their Burgers-type reductions in a systematic manner. The central difficulty is to construct, for a given physically motivated initial profile, a rapidly convergent series in fractional time that remains stable for a broad range of the fractional order and transport coefficients, while still retaining a clear link to the underlying shock-wave physics. To overcome this, the TT combines (i) a Tanh-based exact shock solution of the planar integer-order KS equation, obtained first as a reference via the standard Tanh method, with (ii) a carefully designed fractional-time ansatz in powers of tρ, where the spatial coefficients are determined recursively from the governing equation in the Caputo sense. This construction yields closed-form expressions for the first few terms in the approximation hierarchy and allows one to monitor convergence through residual and absolute error measures.",

This model is developed based on fractional calculus, particularly employing the Riesz–Caputo derivatives, and is capable of accurately accounting for nonlocal and size-dependent effects in structural beams. Unlike classical models that rely on integer-order derivatives, the present model uses fractional-order derivatives, which offer greater precision in analyzing beam behavior at small scales such as micro and nano levels. In this work, various beams with different boundary conditions and loading types are analyzed. To solve the governing fractional equations, a numerical algorithm based on the finite difference method is developed, which also allows for the incorporation of a variable characteristic length function along the beam. The numerical simulation results demonstrate that the order of the fractional derivative and the characteristic length have a direct impact on the amount of beam deflection. These findings indicate that the Euler–Bernoulli model based on Riesz–Caputo derivatives has high potential for realistic simulation of beam bending behavior at small scales, making it an effective tool for accurate analysis of microscale structures.",

    "Abstract": "It is known that rainfall leads to a reduction in driving speed. However, the results of various studies are inconsistent regarding the amount of speed reduction. In this study, we combine high-resolution radar-based rainfall estimates for three days with heavy rainfall with driving speeds derived from floating car data on 1.5 million road sections in Germany. Using linear regression models, we investigate the functional relationship between rainfall and driving speeds depending on road section characteristics like speed limit and number of lanes. We find that the speed reduction due to rainfall is higher at road section with higher speed limits and on multi-lane roads. On highway road section with speed limits of 130 km/h, for example, heavy rainfall of more than 8 L/m2 in five minutes leads to an average speed reduction of more than 30%, although estimates at very high rainfall intensities are subject to increased uncertainty due to data sparsity. Cross-validation shows that including rainfall as a predictor for driving speed reduces mean squared errors by up 14% in general and up to 50% in heavy rainfall conditions. Furthermore, rainfall as a continuous variable should be preferred over categorical variables for a parsimonious model. Our results demonstrate that parsimonious, interpretable models combining radar rainfall data with floating car data can capture systematic rainfall-related speed reductions across a wide range of road types. However, the analysis should be interpreted strictly as a descriptive, event-specific study. It does not support generalizable inference across time, seasons, or broader traffic conditions. To make this approach suitable for operational applications such as real-time speed prediction, route planning, and traffic management, larger multi-event datasets and the consideration of effects like weekday structure and diurnal demand patterns are required to better constrain effects under heavy rainfall conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Illegal dumping poses serious risks to ecosystems and human health, requiring effective and timely monitoring strategies. Advances in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), photogrammetry, and deep learning (DL) have created new opportunities for detecting and characterizing waste objects over large areas. Within the framework of the EMERITUS Project, an EU Horizon Europe initiative supporting the fight against environmental crimes, this study evaluates the performance of pre-trained prompt-based multimodal (PBM) DL models integrated into ArcGIS Pro for object detection and segmentation. To test such models, UAV surveys were specially conducted at a semi-controlled test site in northern Italy, producing very high-resolution orthoimages and video frames populated with simulated waste objects such as tyres, barrels, and sand piles. Three PBM models (CLIPSeg, GroundingDINO, and TextSAM) were tested under varying hyperparameters and input conditions, including orthophotos at multiple resolutions and frames extracted from UAV-acquired videos. Results show that model performance is highly dependent on object type and imagery resolution. In contrast, within the limited ranges tested, hyperparameter tuning rarely produced significant improvements. The evaluation of the models was performed using low IoU to generalize across different types of detection models and to focus on the ability of detecting object. When evaluating the models with orthoimagery, CLIPSeg achieved the highest accuracy with F1 scores up to 0.88 for tyres, whereas barrels and ambiguous classes consistently underperformed. Video-derived (oblique) frames generally outperformed orthophotos, reflecting a closer match to model training perspectives. Despite the current limitations in performances highlighted by the tests, PBM models demonstrate strong potential for democratizing GeoAI (Geospatial Artificial Intelligence). These tools effectively enable non-expert users to employ zero-shot classification in UAV-based monitoring workflows targeting environmental crime.",

    "Abstract": "The efficient extraction of natural gas from water-drive reservoirs is often hindered by premature water breakthrough and the consequent trapping of significant residual gas, which collectively result in suboptimal recovery and economic returns. Traditional production methods have proven inadequate in mitigating water influx and mobilizing this trapped gas, underscoring the need for advanced enhanced gas recovery (EGR) strategies. This research specifically examines the potential of nitrogen injection as a tertiary recovery technique in such reservoirs, with a focus on its mechanistic role and displacement efficiency. Utilizing high-pressure core flooding experiments and complementary numerical simulations, the process of nitrogen injection following water flooding was systematically investigated. Experimental findings at 30 MPa indicate that while water flooding left a substantial residual gas saturation of 28.1%, subsequent nitrogen injection reduced this to 20.8% at breakthrough and ultimately to 7.99%, achieving a final recovery of 88.9%. Simulation results further elucidate that in fractured systems, water preferentially channels through high-permeability fractures, while capillary imbibition leads to gas entrapment within the matrix. Nitrogen injection effectively targets and reduces this trapped gas saturation by 30-50%, demonstrating its efficacy as a viable EGR method. The study thus provides critical theoretical and practical insights for improving recovery in challenging water-drive gas reservoirs.",

    "Abstract": "Factor of Safety (FOS) is a significant index to measure the stability condition of a rock slope in mining or civil engineering. In this paper, we evaluate and compare four different machine learning models, Gaussian Process Regressor (GPR), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Random Forest (RF), and a hybrid genetic algorithm–multi-layer perceptron (GA-MLP), using two separate real-world datasets. The two separate datasets used in this study are from a previously conducted study on highway excavation with rock cutting in China, and another one in a mining site in Peru, with five geotechnical properties used as inputs, including slope height, slope angle, unit weight, cohesion, and friction angle. The two separate datasets were separated into training, validation, and testing datasets. The testing dataset of the models is unseen data used to assess model performance in an unbiased manner. The result shows that the SVR had the highest prediction accuracy, followed by GPR for the mining dataset, and GPR had the highest performance among all the models for the highway excavation dataset. From the boxplot, we can see that SVR, while having the highest predictive accuracy, has a larger variance in prediction compared to GPR for the mining dataset.",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates the swelling potential in clayey soils of the Paleogene Brebi, Mera, and Moigrad formations in the Transylvanian Basin (Romania) by integrating direct free-swelling tests (FS; STAS 1913/12-88) with indirect index-property diagrams and semi-quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD; RIR method). The indirect analysis combines three swelling-susceptibility classification charts—Seed et al. (AI–clay), Van der Merwe (PI–clay), and Dakshanamurthy and Raman (LL–PI)—with mineralogical trends from the Casagrande plasticity chart, complemented by Holtz and Kovacs’s clay-mineral reference fields and Skempton’s activity concept (AI = PI/% &lt; 2 µm). The geotechnical dataset comprises 88 Brebi, 46 Mera, and 263 Moigrad specimens (with parameter counts varying by test), an XRD was performed on a representative subset. The free swell (FS) results indicate that Brebi soils range from low to active behavior (50–135%) without reaching the very active class; most Brebi specimens fall in the medium-activity range. Moigrad spans the full FS spectrum (20–190%) but is predominantly in the medium-to-active range. In contrast, Mera soils exhibit predominantly active behavior, covering the full range of activity classes (30–170%). The empirical classification charts diverge systematically: clay-sensitive schemes tend to assign higher swell susceptibility than the LL–PI approach, especially in carbonate-influenced soils. XRD results corroborate these patterns: Brebi is calcite-rich (mean ≈ 53.5 wt% CaCO3) with minor expandable minerals (mean ≈ 3.1 wt%); Mera is feldspathic (orthoclase mean ≈ 55.3 wt%) with variable expandable phases; and Moigrad has a higher clay-mineral content (mean ≈ 38.8 wt%). Overall, swelling is controlled by the combined effects of clay-fraction reactivity, clay volume continuity, and carbonate-related microstructural constraints.",

    "Abstract": "This article examines some postcolonial dimensions of a global literary movement in the twenty-first century called Neo-Decadence. It begins by highlighting the artistic and political preoccupations of the movement within the context of the century’s turn toward authoritarianism and late capitalism amidst an increasingly hyper-digital landscape. Then, it examines two short stories set in Iran and Peru in order to stress the emergence of what the article calls the Neo-Decadent “Real” (an anti-realism that bears witness to our century’s late capitalist and digital saturations); Fugitive Aestheticism (an aestheticism that, in emphasizing taste, touch, and smell, escapes permanent or totalizing capitalist capture); and Neo-Decadent Sexuality (queer circuits of desire that play with the consumptive impulses of late capitalism). In the process, it demonstrates how Neo-Decadence overlaps with, but also departs from, fin de siècle European decadence. It concludes by examining how Neo-Decadence might expand our on-going understanding of decadence more broadly, as well as the movement’s limitations with respect to its relationship to academia, the environment, and women.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Traumatic experiences may lead to both negative and positive outcomes. Positive psychological changes following trauma are commonly referred to as posttraumatic growth (PTG). The present study aims to examine factors associated with posttraumatic growth among Syrian refugees who have been living in Turkey for an extended period. Methods: This cross-sectional study included a sample of 240 Syrian refugees. Participants completed the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5), the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI), and the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS). Path analysis was conducted to examine the effects of PTSD symptoms and mindfulness levels on posttraumatic growth. In addition, Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spline (MARS) analysis was used to identify threshold values for the contributions of these variables to posttraumatic growth. Results: The mean age of the participants was 36.9 ± 10.4 years, and 47% were female. The direct effect of PTSD symptoms on posttraumatic growth was negative and statistically significant (β = −0.291, p &lt; 0.001). PTSD symptoms also had an indirect effect on posttraumatic growth through mindfulness (β = −0.254), resulting in a total effect of −0.545. According to the MARS model, when MAAS scores exceeded 78, mindfulness demonstrated a positive effect on posttraumatic growth. Conclusions: The findings indicate that PTSD symptoms among refugees are associated with posttraumatic growth through both direct and indirect pathways. Furthermore, mindfulness emerges as a key factor in understanding the development of posttraumatic growth in this population.",

Objective: This study aimed to analyze the association between total and regional body fat and BMC in children and adolescent athletes. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 109 children and adolescents aged 9 to 18 years participating in different sports (indoor volleyball, beach volleyball, swimming, track and field, and basketball). Bone mineral content assessed by DXA and normalized by height (BMC/Height) for the total body less head (TBLH), lumbar spine (L1–L4), and femoral neck was considered the dependent variable. Total and regional (android and gynoid) body fat percentages obtained by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were treated as independent variables. Associations were examined using multivariable linear regression adjusted for biological and training-related covariates. Results: Total body fat (β = −0.014; p &lt; 0.05), android fat (β = −0.011; p &lt; 0.05), and gynoid fat (β = −0.014; p &lt; 0.05) were significantly and inversely associated with lumbar spine BMC/Height. No associations were observed between total, android, or gynoid fat percentage and TBLH or femoral neck BMC/Height (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: The inverse and site-specific association of total, android, and gynoid fat with lumbar spine BMC/Height highlights the greater susceptibility of this skeletal site to adiposity-related detriments, underscoring the importance of site-specific monitoring of bone mineral content, even among physically active youth.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Urinary incontinence (UI) is common among women practicing sports, particularly those involving heavy lifting or high-impact movements that increase intra-abdominal pressure. UI can negatively affect social life, self-confidence, and motivation to remain active. This study aimed to examine the associations of sociodemographic, training-related, obstetric, and surgical factors with UI in female weightlifters. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 84 French women who regularly practiced weightlifting. Participants completed a structured questionnaire collecting sociodemographic and gynecological information, as well as the Urinary Symptom Profile (USP). Data were analyzed using appropriate inferential statistical tests, including the Mann–Whitney U test, Student’s t-test, chi-square test, and Fisher’s exact test, as applicable. A 95% confidence level was adopted for all analyses. Results: Among participants (aged 15–49 years), 51 (60.7%) reported involuntary urine leakage, and 31 (36.9%) scored 1–3 on the USP stress incontinence subscale. Most participants were non-smokers (73.8%), with a median of 3.5 years of weightlifting experience, four weekly training sessions, and six–seven competitions per year. No significant associations were found between UI and sociodemographic factors, obstetric history, previous surgeries, or training characteristics. Maximal lifts in Clean &amp; Jerk and Snatch exercises were also similar between participants with and without UI. Slight trends suggested a higher UI prevalence among women with vaginal deliveries, episiotomies, or vaginal lacerations. Regarding athletes with and without UI, no differences were found (p &gt; 0.05) with respect to weightlifting belt use or the breathing phase during load lifting. Conclusions: UI is common among female weightlifters, but in this study, was not associated with sociodemographic factors or weightlifting practices. These findings indicate that UI prevalence cannot be explained by the variables studied and highlight the need for further research into other potential contributing factors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have experienced sustained occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. While infection prevention and control (IPC) practices have been widely implemented, limited prospective data exist on how occupational exposure risk and adherence to protective practices evolve over time, particularly beyond the acute phases of the pandemic. This study aimed to prospectively assess occupational and community exposure risk to COVID-19 among HCWs and to evaluate temporal changes in adherence to IPC practices during routine care and aerosol-generating procedures. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted among HCWs from four public hospitals in the region of Thessaly, Greece. Eligible participants were HCWs who reported contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases. The data were collected at baseline (January–March 2022) and at a six-month follow-up using the World Health Organization’s “Risk Assessment and Management of Exposure of Health Care Workers in the Context of COVID-19” questionnaire. The instrument captured demographic characteristics, professional roles, occupational and community exposure, and adherence to IPC practices. Results: A total of 203 HCWs participated in the study. The overall proportion of HCWs reporting occupational exposure was 72.9% in both assessments. Among HCWs with occupational exposure (n = 148), the proportion classified as high-risk showed a statistically significant increase from 76% (95% CI: 0.6951–0.8320) at baseline to 88% (95% CI: 0.8258–0.9310) at follow-up (p = 0.010). This shift reflects a substantial effect size, with the odds of high-risk classification being more than double at follow-up (OR = 2.24). Nurses consistently demonstrated higher risk compared with physicians. The overall use of personal protective equipment remained high. However, adherence to several IPC practices declined over time, including removal and replacement of PPE according to protocol and frequent decontamination of high-touch surfaces. Conclusions: Occupational exposure risk among HCWs remained substantial and increased over time despite stable occupational exposure estimates. The observed decline in adherence to key IPC measures highlights the need for continuous monitoring and reinforcement of protective practices in healthcare settings.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Safe disposal of unused medicines represents an increasing public health and environmental concern. Until 2024, Romanian community pharmacies collected expired medicines from the public, though implementation was inconsistent. Using a knowledge–attitude–practice (KAP) framework, this study assessed community pharmacists’ self-reported involvement in pharmaceutical waste prevention in Bihor County, Romania, one year after new legislation transferred collection responsibilities to hospital-based centers. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in May 2025 using a self-administered questionnaire comprising 22 items covering socio-demographics, professional practices, knowledge, and attitudes. Eligible participants were community pharmacists (N = 285). Results: Respondents reported high awareness and favourable attitudes toward pharmaceutical waste management: 98.2% indicated awareness of current legislation, 94.4% reported receiving training on the new regulations, 99.6% acknowledged health and environmental risks, and 98.9% expressed agreement that patient education is important. However, 55.4% reported providing disposal information only when patients requested it, while 89.8% indicated that patients rarely asked about medicine disposal. Self-reported proactive counseling increased with patient request frequency (χ2(3) = 7.914, p = 0.048), with pharmacists in the high-request group reporting substantially higher proactive counseling than those in the low-request group (83.3% vs. 42.9%). In an adjusted logistic regression, low request frequency was associated with lower odds of proactive counseling (aOR = 0.21, 95% CI: 0.05–0.98, p = 0.047). Most respondents (94.6%) perceived waste-related responsibilities, though these perceptions were only weakly related to reported counseling behaviors. Conclusions: Pharmacists reported high awareness and positive attitudes toward pharmaceutical waste management, but counseling remained reactive. Patient demand was a key correlate of counseling proactivity, underscoring the need for structured education within Romania’s hospital-based take-back system.",

    "Abstract": "Drug-induced agranulocytosis is a rare but life-threatening adverse reaction associated with numerous non-chemotherapy drugs. Management relies on immediate drug withdrawal, infection control, and, in selected patients, administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). This review summarizes current knowledge on the determinants of epidemiology, clinical presentation, hematologic and biologic features, comorbidities, and outcomes influencing the decision to introduce G-CSF in drug-induced agranulocytosis. Evidence from observational studies and meta-analyses suggests that G-CSF shortens neutropenia duration and hospitalization, although its impact on mortality remains uncertain. The decision to use G-CSF should consider initial neutrophil count, presence of severe infection or sepsis, age, and comorbidities. Despite the accumulated experience, randomized controlled trials are still lacking, and treatment algorithms remain empirical.",

Its core bioactive component, albiflorin, exhibits significant pharmacological activity, but its biosynthetic pathway remains unclear, severely limiting the targeted regulation and sustainable utilization of this compound. In this study, integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that tissue specificity is a key factor driving metabolite accumulation. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified a gene module significantly positively correlated with albiflorin content. From this module, key candidate genes were screened, including MYB and bHLH transcription factor genes as well as CYP450. The expression patterns of these candidate genes were subsequently validated by qRT-PCR, confirming a strong correlation between the transcriptomic and experimental data. These findings not only clarify the molecular basis for the tissue-specific accumulation of albiflorin and provide critical targets for elucidating its complete biosynthetic pathway but also lay a solid foundation for molecular breeding and quality improvement of Paeonia lactiflora.",

    "Abstract": "As sessile organisms, plants adapt to their environments through shoot branching, a key determinant of plant architecture. However, the regulatory mechanisms governing this trait in cucumber remain incompletely understood. Although certain WRKY transcription factors have been implicated in branching regulation in other species, whether they are involved in cucumber branching has not yet been reported. In this study, we identified a transcription factor, CsWRKY50, whose expression positively correlates with branching in cucumber. The transcript level of CsWRKY50 was markedly elevated in the multi-branching mutant nwd and in high-branching cucumber varieties. Notably, CsWRKY50 showed the highest expression in axillary meristems compared to other tissues. Heterologous overexpression of CsWRKY50 in Arabidopsis significantly increased branch number and altered the transcriptional levels of several branching-related genes. Yeast two-hybrid assays confirmed that CsWRKY50 interacts with CsRAX5 and a truncated form of CsMYB84. The additive branching phenotype observed in the CsWRKY50-overexpressing Atbrc1 mutant indicates that CsWRKY50 may function independently of BRC1. Notably, RAX genes were up-regulated under these conditions. This work provides novel genetic resources and a theoretical foundation for improving plant architecture in cucumber cultivation.",

    "Abstract": "Selenium contamination in arid agricultural basins remains a key ecological concern, yet the Wister Unit of the Imperial Wildlife Area has received comparatively little hydrochemical study. This investigation provides the most integrated assessment to date of selenium, salinity, nitrate, stable water isotopes (δ2H and δ18O), and selected redox-sensitive trace elements within the Wister Unit and its contributing open agricultural drains, with the goal of identifying controls on selenium concentrations and mobility. Water samples from open agricultural drains, shallow groundwater tile drains, canal project water, and tailwater return flow were analyzed for Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), major ions, nutrients, selenium, and stable water isotopes. A subset of samples was anlayzed for iron, manganese, and vanadium. Overall, 71% of open drain and tile drain samples collected in this study exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency aquatic-life criterion of 5 µg/L, indicating persistent ecological risk. All waters plotted along an evaporation trajectory originating from imported Colorado River irrigation water; however, isotopic enrichment did not scale directly with salinity. Pure evaporation models predicted much lower TDS values than observed, and the most evaporated samples were not the most saline or selenium-rich. These results demonstrate that simple soil water evaporation alone cannot explain the data. Instead, the broad isotopic range at similar salinities reflects a secondary process in which salts that accumulated in soils during dry or average years are later mobilized and flushed during periods of surplus water and heavy irrigation. Low dissolved iron, manganese, and vanadium concentrations in a subset of water samples indicate predominantly oxidizing conditions, under which selenium behaves conservatively during salt leaching, producing a strong correlation with TDS. Selenium levels measured in Wister Unit are generally lower than those reported in nearby areas during the 1990s–2000s, implying changes in salt accumulation, hydrologic routing, or agricultural practices. These results refine the conceptual model for the Wister Unit and motivate future work on selenium speciation, nitrate isotope tracing, time series monitoring, and soil-salt interactions.",

    "Abstract": "Maintaining sustainable mental health is an increasing societal challenge in Japan, where psychological distress and sleep problems have become major public health concerns. This study examined how three culturally grounded dimensions of self-construal—Subjective Self (SS), Objective Self (OS), and Autonomous Self (AS)—relate to both positive and negative indicators of psychological adjustment among Japanese adults. This study aimed to examine whether internally guided forms of self-regulation (SS and AS) function as psychological resources, whereas externally guided self-regulation (OS) operates as a potential vulnerability factor in a culturally tight social context. By simultaneously examining multiple indicators of adjustment, this research clarifies how culturally shared self-regulatory patterns are linked to distress and sleep difficulties that affect large segments of the population. From a public health perspective, the findings highlight socially reinforced risk and protective patterns that can inform population-level prevention and mental health promotion in settings such as schools, workplaces, and communities, rather than relying solely on individual clinical intervention. These results underscore the importance of integrating cultural psychology into public health frameworks aimed at promoting sustainable mental health in contemporary and increasingly diverse social environments.",

    "Abstract": "The unique geographical isolation and climate sensitivity of island ecosystems make them valuable for ecological research. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an important indicator when monitoring and evaluating these systems, and its prediction has become a key research focus. However, island NDVI prediction remains uncertain due to a limited understanding of vegetation growth and insufficient high-quality data. Deterministic models fail to capture or quantify such uncertainty, often leading to overfitting. To address this issue, this study proposes an uncertainty prediction model for the island NDVI within a coding–prediction–decoding framework, referred to as a Convolutional Autoencoder–Regularized Bayesian Neural Network (CAE-RBNN). The model integrates a convolutional autoencoder with feature regularization to extract latent NDVI features, aiming to reconcile spatial scale disparities with environmental data, while a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) quantifies uncertainty arising from limited samples and an incomplete understanding of the process. Finally, Monte Carlo sampling and SHAP analysis evaluate model performance, quantify predictive uncertainty, and enhance interpretability. Experiments on six islands in the Xisha archipelago demonstrate that CAE-RBNN outperforms the Convolutional Neural Network–Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN), the Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (ConvRNN), Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), and Random Forest (RF). Among them, CAE-RBNN reduces the MAE and MSE of the single-time-step prediction task by 8.40% and 10.69%, respectively, compared with the suboptimal model and decreases them by 16.31% and 22.57%, respectively, in the continuous prediction task. More importantly, it effectively quantifies the uncertainty of different driving forces, thereby improving the reliability of island NDVI predictions influenced by the environment.",

    "Abstract": "All-sky cameras provide continuous hemispherical observations essential for atmospheric monitoring and observatory operations; however, automated classification of sky conditions in tropical environments remains challenging due to strong illumination variability, atmospheric scattering, and overlapping thin-cloud structures. This study proposes EfficientNet-Attention-SPP Multi-scale Network (EASMNet), a physics-aware deep learning framework for robust all-sky scene classification using hemispherical imagery acquired at the Thai National Observatory. The proposed architecture integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks for radiometric channel stabilization, the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) for spatial–semantic refinement, and Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) for hemispherical multi-scale context aggregation within a fully fine-tuned EfficientNetB7 backbone, forming a domain-aware atmospheric representation framework. A large-scale dataset comprising 122,660 RGB images across 13 day–night sky-scene categories was curated, capturing diverse tropical atmospheric conditions including humidity, haze, illumination transitions, and sensor noise. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the EASMNet achieves 93% overall accuracy, outperforming representative convolutional (VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121) and transformer-based architectures (Swin Transformer, Vision Transformer). Ablation analyses confirm the complementary contributions of hierarchical attention and multi-scale aggregation, while class-wise evaluation yields F1-scores exceeding 0.95 for visually distinctive categories such as Day Humid, Night Clear Sky, and Night Noise. Residual errors are primarily confined to physically transitional and low-contrast atmospheric regimes. These results validate the EASMNet as a reliable, interpretable, and computationally feasible framework for real-time observatory dome automation, astronomical scheduling, and continuous atmospheric monitoring, and provide a scalable foundation for autonomous sky-observation systems deployable across diverse climatic regions.",

    "Abstract": "The increasing prevalence of obesity and metabolic disorders poses a major global health challenge. In the present study, purple sweet potato Tainung No. 73 was fermented using Lactobacillus amylovorus OFMLa-73 and Levilactobacillus brevis OFMLb-143 to enrich the specific bioactive metabolite indolelactic acid. Furthermore, supplementation with fermented sweet potato (FSPE) ethanol extract resulted in a significant reduction in body weight gain, adipocyte hypertrophy, and hepatic lipid accumulation, while also improving serum lipid profiles in high-fat diet-induced obesity mice. These physiological improvements were associated with the downregulated expression of adipogenic and inflammatory genes in both liver and adipose tissues. Furthermore, lipidomic analysis revealed that FSPE modulated key lipid species, including ceramides and acylcarnitines, which are implicated in metabolic dysfunction. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that lactic acid fermentation enhanced purple sweet potato’s functional potential, positioning FSPE as a promising candidate for dietary intervention in obesity management.",

    "Abstract": "In genetic disease assessment centers, DNA sequencing can produce results irrelevant to the genetic examination’s purpose. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) recommends evaluating and reporting 81 genes discovered using clinical genomic sequencing. While population studies on large cohorts can provide statistics on the prevalence of secondary findings (SFs), no studies have been published yet on large cohorts in Turkiye. We investigated ACMG SF by evaluating clinical exome sequencing data in 1600 individuals from different regions in Turkiye. We detected SF variants reported in ClinVar in 86 individuals (5.375%). Of the SFs, 30% were cardiovascular, 26% were cancer, 16% were neonatal metabolic disorders, and 28% were variants associated with various genetic diseases. In addition, we identified 212 different variants in 226 individuals and 45 different genes, which were not reported in ClinVar. When our results are compared with the Turkish National Genome and Bioinformatics Project database and studies in the literature, the studies vary in terms of participant characteristics, sequencing techniques, and versions of the ACMG SF list. Our findings highlight the importance of expanding and tailoring SF reporting guidelines in populations with high consanguinity and limited cohort-based data.",

    "Abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most frequent B-cell type of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Recent genomic studies have highlighted the importance of genetic alterations in apoptotic pathways that help malignant DLBCL cells to evade apoptosis. Apoptosis evasion by DLBCL cells is known to mediate resistance to chemotherapy. Advances in the field of regulated cell death (RCD) research have identified novel therapeutic avenues in cancer. In particular, non-apoptotic RCDs can be targeted to overcome resistance to apoptosis in cancer and ensure cell death. In this review, we have highlighted the contribution of multiple RCDs, including apoptosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, PANoptosis, NETotic cell death, autophagy-dependent cell death, cuproptosis, methuosis, or mitotic death, to normal development of B lymphocytes and DLBCL pathogenesis. We have summarized molecular mechanisms governing distinct RCDs in DLBCL, differences in cell death pathways in activated B-cell (ABC) and germinal center B-cell (GCB) DLBCL subtypes, prognostic values of RCD-related genes, and discussed the implication of RCD pathways for DLBCL treatment. Notably, the impact of RCDs goes far beyond just killing tumor cells. RCD modalities are important for orchestrating the immune response and modulating the tumor microenvironment. The current review also aims to reveal the effect of different RCDs on the tumor microenvironment in DLBCL. Most RCDs play a dual role in DLBCL, demonstrating both tumor-inducing and tumor-suppressing effects, which suggests that their targeting should be exploited with caution. Our analysis suggests that pharmacological ferroptosis induction may be the most promising RCD-targeting strategy in DLBCL.",

    "Abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are membrane-bound nanoparticles released by almost all cell types into the extracellular space, acting as important mediators of intercellular communication by transferring proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids horizontally. EVs are generally classified into small EVs (&lt;200 nm), medium/large EVs (&gt;200 nm), microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, with current classification methods focusing on physical properties, molecular composition, and cellular origin, as detailed in the MISEV2023 guidelines. EVs are highly promising for diagnostic and therapeutic applications due to their intrinsic biocompatibility, stability in biological fluids, capacity to carry diverse molecular cargo, and potential for drug delivery and functionalization to enable targeted delivery and tissue repair. This narrative review discusses the emerging roles of EVs across various medical fields, including obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology, urology, oncology, orthopedics, neurology, immunology, wound healing, chronic pain management, dermatology, and cardiology. In each discipline, EVs show potential as biomarkers for diagnosing physiological or pathological conditions and as carriers for targeted drug delivery and regenerative treatments. Exosomes, a major type of small EVs, have especially attracted attention as versatile nanocarriers for precision medicine. However, translation into clinical practice requires addressing key pitfalls, including the standardization of isolation and characterization protocols, dose definition, GMP-compliant large-scale production, and regulatory approval. Ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration across disciplines and thorough clinical testing will be essential to unlock the full biomedical potential of EVs and establish them as transformative tools in personalized healthcare.",

    "Abstract": "Biofilms are microbial communities embedded in an extracellular matrix that facilitates their attachment to surfaces. This lifestyle provides advantages to pathogenic bacteria, including increased survival in the presence of antibiotics and an enhanced capacity to develop resistance. Once a biofilm is established, infections get difficult to eradicate and frequently become chronic. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop novel strategies to counteract biofilm-associated antibiotic resistance. Here, we developed a method to monitor the evolution of antimicrobial resistance, aiming to evaluate novel drugs against bacterial resistance to antibiotics. We validated this methodology using an RNase chimera with antibiofilm activity and a reported ability to hinder colistin resistance in planktonic cultures of Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii). We assessed the emergence of resistance in A. baumannii biofilms by repeated cycles of colistin exposure. This method not only preserves biofilm structure throughout treatment but also enables controlled induction of resistance acquisition while monitoring antimicrobial efficacy. Although the RNase enhanced the antibiotic’s activity against biofilms by reducing by 50% the effective dose, it did not prevent the emergence of colistin resistance, indicating that the protein may use distinct mechanisms against planktonic and biofilm communities. Nonetheless, our findings highlight the potential of this methodology for evaluating antibiotic-adjuvant candidates to combat antibiotic resistance in biofilms.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores the virtualizability of team processes and their implications for team performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main research question was: What is the effect of the ease of virtualizing team processes on the outcomes of teams that have shifted from in-person to virtual work? A survey method was employed, and the data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Building on the frameworks based on literature review, the study defined sensory, relational, and synchronization requirements, along with the mechanisms of reach and representation. Results show that sensory requirements negatively influence the virtualizability of team processes, while relational and synchronization requirements do not have a statistically significant impact. Although the mechanisms of reach and representation do not moderate the relationships between constructs, they do have a direct positive effect on susceptibility to virtualization. Contrary to initial expectations, virtualizability positively affects both tangible and emotional outcomes, indicating that cohesion and satisfaction can be maintained—or even improved—in virtual teams. These findings enhance the theoretical understanding of team processes and virtualizability and offer practical insights for managing distributed teams.",

While advancements in surgical techniques and perioperative management have enhanced survival rates, these procedures remain associated with significant morbidity, extended hospitalizations, and complex recovery trajectories. Background/Objectives: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols, originally developed for colorectal surgery, have shown promise in optimizing perioperative care across various surgical disciplines. However, their application in cardiac and thoracic transplantation is still emerging. This article evaluates recent advancements in ERAS protocols tailored to cardiac and thoracic transplant patients, focusing on preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative interventions. Results: Evidence highlights the potential of ERAS to reduce complications, shorten hospital stays, and improve long-term outcomes. Key strategies include preoperative optimization through nutritional and psychosocial prehabilitation, intraoperative adoption of minimally invasive techniques and refined anesthesia practices, and postoperative protocols emphasizing opioid-sparing pain management, early mobilization, and nutritional recovery. Conclusions: This review identifies gaps in current research and offers recommendations for the broader implementation and standardization of ERAS protocols in cardiothoracic surgery, with emphasis on cardiothoracic transplantation, aiming to improve outcomes for this high-risk population.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare but important complication linked to poor outcomes. Diagnosing it is difficult because neurological symptoms are often subtle or nonspecific, and conventional cytology and imaging have limitations. This review summarizes current evidence on the neuroradiologic features of CNS infiltration in AML and explores the growing role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing detection and characterization. Methods: A thorough narrative review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Embase, employing key terms related to AML, CNS involvement, MRI, CT, PET, AI, machine learning, deep learning, and radiomics. Of several thousand records, 138 relevant studies were selected and analyzed across four main areas: neuroradiologic patterns, imaging biomarkers, AI and radiomics applications, and emerging computational trends. Results: Imaging findings in AML mainly include myeloid sarcomas (isointense on T1, hyperintense on T2/FLAIR, restricted diffusion) and leptomeningeal enhancement. Secondary ischemic or hemorrhagic lesions may indicate brain leukocytosis. MRI proved more sensitive than CT, while PET/CT helped detect extramedullary disease. Recent AI and radiomics models showed high tumor classification and prognosis accuracy in similar CNS conditions, indicating significant potential for application in AML-CNS. Conclusions: Combining AI-based image analysis with multimodal neuroimaging could significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment for CNS involvement in AML. Progress is still challenged by the rarity of the condition and the lack of large, annotated datasets.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The Lung Immune Prognostic Index (LIPI) has recently emerged as a novel prognostic biomarker in several malignancies, particularly in patients receiving immunotherapy. However, its role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), especially in non-metastatic and tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-treated patients, remains unclear. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, 153 patients diagnosed with RCC between 2012 and 2024 were analyzed. Prognostic scores including LIPI, International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC), and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) scores were calculated. The patients were stratified into risk groups (good, intermediate, and poor) based on these scores. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression methods. Correlations between scoring systems were assessed using Pearson’s correlation. Results: The median follow-up was 29.1 months. A total of 55 (35.9%) patients had metastases at diagnosis. LIPI was significantly associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and disease-free survival (DFS) (p &lt; 0.05). In the multivariate Cox analysis, LIPI remained an independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS. Strong positive correlations were found between LIPI and both IMDC and MSKCC scores (r &gt; 0.6, p &lt; 0.001). Notably, LIPI demonstrated prognostic relevance even in patients treated with TKIs. Conclusions: LIPI is a simple and accessible prognostic tool that provides significant survival stratification in RCC patients. Its predictive utility extends beyond immunotherapy cohorts, indicating potential value in broader RCC management. Integration of LIPI into current prognostic models may improve individualized treatment approaches.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Unfractionated heparin (UFH) is routinely administered during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to prevent thromboembolic complications. However, there are no clear evidence-based guidelines defining optimal heparin dosing or target activated clotting time (ACT) values. This study aimed to evaluate the association between intraprocedural UFH dosing, ACT values, and peri-procedural stroke risk in the overall population of patients undergoing TAVR, with a prespecified stratified analysis according to body mass index (BMI ≥ 30 vs. &lt;30 kg/m2). Methods: This analysis enrolled consecutive individuals with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who were treated with TAVR using either balloon-expandable or self-expanding valves. The primary outcome was the occurrence of stroke during the periprocedural period in the overall population and according to BMI (&lt;30 vs. ≥30 kg/m2). Secondary endpoints included periprocedural parameters, clinical outcomes (in-hospital and 1-year mortality), and safety outcomes. Subgroup analysis was performed to assess stroke risk according to ACT values. Patients with atrial fibrillation or receiving chronic oral anticoagulation were excluded. Results: A total of 1045 patients underwent TAVR between 2022 and 2024, including 827 with BMI &lt; 30 and 218 with BMI ≥ 30. The study population had a mean age of 82 ± 6 years, and 56% of patients were male. In the overall study population, the mean heparin dose was 47 U/kg and the mean ACT value was 218 s. Patients with lower BMI received higher heparin doses (50 vs. 40 U/kg, p &lt; 0.01) and had higher ACT values (221 vs. 208 s, p &lt; 0.01). Protamine use was low and similar between groups. Periprocedural stroke rates were low overall (1.1%) and comparable between study groups (1.2% vs. 0.9%, p = 0.71). One-year mortality was also similar (3% vs. 4%, p = 0.53), with no significant differences in other safety outcomes. Subgroup analysis by ACT (≤250 vs. &gt;250 s) showed no difference in stroke rates (1% vs. 1.5%, p = 0.60). Conclusions: In this single-center cohort, differences in heparin dosing and ACT values were not associated with differences in peri-procedural stroke or overall procedural outcomes. However, given the low number of stroke events, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. Prospective randomized studies are needed to define optimal anticoagulation strategies during TAVR.",

    "Abstract": "Backgrounds/Objectives: Adolescent soccer players are exposed to elevated injury risk due to rapid musculoskeletal development and high physical demands. Neuromuscular training (NMT) and speed–agility–quickness (SAQ) training are widely used to enhance performance and reduce injury risk in youth athletes. While both approaches are effective, comparative evidence regarding their modality-specific performance adaptations remains limited. Furthermore, few studies have discussed how such performance data may inform evidence-based or data-driven training selection in youth sports contexts. Methods: Thirty-six male youth soccer players with at least three years of playing experience, affiliated with Team A in Gyeonggi-do and Team B in Chungcheongbuk-do, participated in the study (NMTG, n = 21; SAQG, n = 15). Participants completed either an NMT or SAQ training program for eight weeks. To objectively assess exercise performance, pre- and post-tests were conducted measuring dynamic balance, vertical jump, zigzag run, and carioca. Results: Findings revealed a significant main effect of time for lower limb power (p &lt; 0.05), but no significant group × time interaction, indicating that both NMTG and SAQG improved significantly over the 8-week period. Conversely, significant interaction effects were found for agility (p &lt; 0.001), with SAQG demonstrating superior enhancements compared to NMTG. Dynamic balance showed no significant time effect or interaction. Conclusions: While NMTG and SAQG are equally effective for enhancing lower limb power, SAQG provides modality-specific advantages for agility in youth soccer players. These results emphasize time-dependent adaptations for power and the distinct benefits of SAQG for multi-directional speed. These adaptation profiles offer a data-driven framework for optimizing training selection in youth athletes.",

    "Abstract": "The ATHENA (Advanced Tool for Holistic Evaluation and Nurturing of Abilities) competency framework proposes a multidimensional approach to human performance structured around five interdependent dimensions (cognition, conation, knowledge, emotion, and sensori-motion), operationalized through 60 fine-grained facets. Although ATHENA is grounded in contemporary psychological theory and supported conceptually by multivariate research in intelligence, creativity, and skill acquisition, empirical evidence regarding the clarity and practical comprehensibility of its facets remains limited. This study investigates the extent to which instructional designers and human resource development (HRD) professionals—two groups who routinely operationalize competencies for learning, assessment, and workforce development—understand and evaluate the semantic clarity and usability of the 60 facets. Seventy-five practitioners completed a structured evaluation of the ATHENA framework facets, which are designed to be used in a hybrid intelligence system for competency management. This article presents the theoretical background, methodological design, and results concerning users’ comprehension of the framework’s components. The findings support, in general, the compatibility of ATHENA’s facets and practitioners’ conceptions.",

    "Abstract": "Training the public health workforce is a critical component of health system strengthening. In Mexico, postgraduate education operates under a national accreditation framework intended to ensure academic quality and social relevance, yet comprehensive information about the scope and distribution of training programs is limited. This study characterizes public health and related academic programs available in 2024, examining the institutional sector, delivery modality, geographic distribution, and accreditation status. A systematic institutional mapping was conducted through structured searches of the official websites of public and private higher education institutions. Eligible programs included bachelor’s degrees, specializations, master’s degrees, and PhDs that were active between March and November 2024. Searches used predefined keyword combinations, repeated at multiple timepoints, and were restricted to official institutional domains. Data were extracted on academic level, institutional sector, delivery format, duration, geographic region, and inclusion in the National Postgraduate System. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to analyze accreditation patterns; geospatial analysis assessed regional distribution. A total of 175 programs were identified across 30 of Mexico’s 32 states. Professional master’s degrees represented the largest category, followed by research-oriented master’s and PhD programs. Public institutions offered nearly two-thirds of all programs. Among postgraduate programs, fewer than half were accredited, with accreditation concentrated in master’s degrees in science (84.6%) and PhDs (55.6%). Only 23.0% of professional master’s degree were accredited. Most programs were delivered fully in person; online offerings were limited and more common in private institutions. Research-oriented programs were geographically concentrated in a small number of states, whereas professional programs exhibited broader but uneven national distribution. Public health education in Mexico shows growth in professionally oriented training but also reveals persistent gaps in accreditation, geographic equity, and flexible delivery modalities. The disproportionate expansion of professional programs without corresponding integration into accreditation frameworks raises concerns for workforce planning and educational equity. Strengthening national information systems, improving institutional reporting standards, and aligning accreditation criteria with workforce needs are essential to ensure that public health training supports progress towards universal health coverage and the Sustainable Development Goals.",

    "Abstract": "The maritime industry is undergoing significant transformation, necessitating a reassessment of operational strategies, particularly for bulk carriers. Unlike container ships or ferries, which benefit from speed optimisation and real-time operational adjustments, bulk carriers face distinct challenges arising from rigid scheduling practices and the inherent complexities of cargo handling. Variability in loading and unloading processes, fluctuating discharge rates, and port congestion further constrain the practical implementation of Just-In-Time (JIT) arrival strategies in this segment. Through an exploratory analysis of major shipping segments, this study examines the structural challenges and operational limitations associated with the application of JIT port-arrival concepts in dry bulk shipping.",

    "Abstract": "Rapid depressurization and warming during recovery can trigger stress in deep-sea microbes and accelerate RNA degradation. We developed a remotely operated vehicle (ROV)-oriented multi-sequence microbial sampler for 2000 m sampling (20 MPa, 2 °C) that integrates in situ filtration with immediate RNAlater injection (an RNA stabilization reagent), collecting up to 12 samples per dive. A Dirichlet sampling–B-spline–SVM framework was used to optimize the cam profile of the sequence trigger for robust actuation under geometric constraints and realistic tolerances in both manufacturing and assembly. Relative to the baseline 3-4-5 motion law, the optimized design reduces nominal peak driving torque by ~18–20% and lowers the maximum torque under tolerance perturbations; tests show a further ~10–25% reduction using a SiC ball–ZrO2 block pair versus a MoS2-lubricated titanium pushrod–ZrO2 block pair. A Darcy–Forchheimer porous-media computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model predicts earlier clogging on the lower membrane and a fast-to-slow RNAlater displacement process; greater membrane resistance mismatch delays 95% displacement and increases RNAlater loss. Simulations and Rhodamine B tests suggest an RNAlater consumption of 0.9 L per parallel filter (one membrane per side), and 20 MPa chamber tests confirm stable operation and membrane retrieval.",

    "Abstract": "Vulvovaginal candidosis is an affliction caused by yeasts. Symptoms in the vulva are generally associated with the spreading of infected vaginal fluid. To better understand the role of the vulva in these dynamics, in this study we aim to fully identify and characterize non-Candida albicans vulvar yeast isolates. Fifty-four vulvar swabs were obtained from 31 women attending a gynecological consultation. After species identification, fluconazole susceptibility was assessed by the microdilution broth method. Biofilm biomass was quantified using crystal violet staining, and phospholipase and hemolysin production were assessed by plating a calibrated suspension in suitable culture media. Finally, adherence to cervical cells was assessed by infecting a monolayer of HeLa cells. Among the 54 vulvar isolates obtained, 12 different species were identified. About 54% (29/54) of vulvar isolates were resistant to fluconazole. All isolates were able to produce a high amount of biofilm biomass. Pichia kudriavzevii and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa were the only species that produced phospholipase; hemolysin production was detected in isolates belonging to almost all species. Almost all species had the ability to adhere to HeLa cells. These results indicate that the vulva act as a reservoir for fluconazole-resistant yeasts, which are also potentially virulent.",

    "Abstract": "Digital services companies help in the digitalization and transformation of the industry in driving Malaysia by advancing the economy of the country. However, digital services companies often face financial risks in terms of liquidity, solvency, efficiency, profitability, and operational risks. These risks increase the chances of failure and financial volatility, which put the companies at a serious disadvantage. This paper proposes an integrated Entropy-Weight TOPSIS model to analyze the financial risks of the listed digital services companies within Malaysia. The entropy method helps to prevent subjective weights by reflecting on information obtained from the financial reports of the companies. This study also provides an analysis to show possible improvements for the companies. The interest coverage ratio (ICR), which measures the capability to settle interest on debt, shows the highest weight followed by the basic indicator approach (BIA) and return on asset (ROA) based on the entropy weighting method. In addition, CLOUDPT, ITMAX, and MSNIAGA are ranked as the top three digital services companies that give the highest relative closeness to the ideal solution. The results help the risk managers to identify the criteria that caused the greatest financial risk in digital services companies to formulate targeted strategies to improve the companies’ financial health.",

    "Abstract": "This paper examines the regressive nature of the value-added tax and proposes an integrated framework combining a uniform value-added tax rate with progressive, digitally administered rebates. The model was performed using household- and firm-level microsimulations with Monte Carlo methods. It demonstrates that equity can be reached without revenue neutrality being undermined. Simulation results for a calibrated 2024–2025 economy show the proposed rebate structure reduces the effective tax burden on the lowest income quintile from 13.5% to 5.4% of income, delivering a net cash benefit of USD 786.88 and a welfare gain of 6.10%. The policy is projected to generate a robust average VAT revenue of USD 17.44 million, with a 97.8% probability of a positive fiscal impact, while reducing the poverty rate by 2.6% and lowering inequality (Gini coefficient of utility to 0.199). The outcomes present a welfare gain for the poor, a small firm-level effect, and a decrease in poverty and inequality. The results suggest a feasible policy route towards a more equitable tax system, thus promoting indirectly to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth) and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities).",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the evolving role of board heterogeneity, including gender diversity, board attributes, and governance practices, in shaping corporate risk outcomes. In mature governance settings, corporate risk management emerges from the interaction between board structure, independence, leadership arrangements, and boardroom composition, such that gender diversity in isolation may no longer fully capture board effectiveness. We argue that while gender diversity remains relevant, its explanatory power operates in conjunction with other board characteristics that condition the quality of decision-making in already well-functioning boards. Using multiple regression estimations on a sample of STOXX600 firms, our main outcomes show that in mature European boards gender diversity (1) improves the operational efficiency, conditional by model specification, (2) increase debts level to finance growth, thereby enabling more rapid expansion than would otherwise be possible, without pushing to extensive borrowing, while reduce leverage starting 33% (3) prevents corporate failure starting 40% women on board (4) gender-diverse boards increase liquidity when critical mass is met (33%). Overall, the findings suggest that gender-diverse boards contribute to a reconfiguration of firms’ risk exposure across operational, financial, liquidity, and failure dimensions, rather than a uniform reduction in risk.",

    "Abstract": "Many retailers start to implement the practice of buy online and pick up in store (BOPS) by integrating their online and offline channels. In this paper, we study the effects of BOPS cooperation (i.e., channel cooperation) in the presence of advertising competition. We first investigate how BOPS cooperation affects online and offline retailers’ advertising levels, prices, demands and profits under fixed and optimized pricing strategies and further explore the conditions under which retailers decide to implement BOPS cooperation for greater benefits. Next, we conduct a comparative study of the two pricing strategies before and after BOPS cooperation, examine the impact of different pricing strategies on advertising levels, and assess retailers’ preferences for the two pricing strategies. We also perform numerical examinations to derive insights into when BOPS cooperation is most appropriate and what advertising and pricing strategies are optimal for retailers. The numerical results show that implementing BOPS cooperation is not necessarily optimal for online and offline retailers and that the offline hassle cost, commission level and convenience coefficient in BOPS are the major determinants of retailers’ profitability. We also find that the BOPS convenience coefficient can be a partial compensation for the competitive effect of advertising in the optimized pricing strategy. In addition, we identify conditions under which retailers are better off in different cases. In particular, we find that when BOPS commission is high and offline hassle cost is low, online and offline retailers can benefit more from the optimized pricing strategy.",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates activity patterns and determines optimal observation periods for assessing the welfare of lowland tapirs (Tapirus terrestris L.) housed in the following two Danish zoological institutions: Aalborg Zoo and Randers Regnskov. The objectives were to identify the most efficient time window for welfare assessments, determine whether machine learning (ML) could support behavioral evaluations by providing automated estimates of activity, and examine whether automated pose-based tracking could serve as a proxy for manual ethogram observations. Behavioral data were collected using standardized ethograms from wildlife camera footage recorded over 72 h. Lowland tapirs were generally more active during daytime, with individuals at Aalborg Zoo showing peak activity between 07:00 and 14:00, while those at Randers Regnskov were most active between 12:00 and 18:00. Activity patterns differed between institutions, with Aalborg individuals displaying concentrated activity peaks and Randers individuals showing more evenly distributed activity. A preliminary ML analysis using the pose-estimation tool SLEAP demonstrated that movement-based activity estimates closely matched manually coded data, suggesting that automated tracking may offer an efficient and non-invasive tool for welfare monitoring. The findings highlight the potential for integrating automated analysis into routine welfare assessments of zoo-housed animals.",

    "Abstract": "Coastal wetlands are among the most ecologically valuable yet vulnerable ecosystems, particularly in regions experiencing rapid urban expansion. This study provides a four-decade assessment of land use and land cover (LULC) dynamics and their implications for ecosystem service value (ESV) in the Beidagang Wetland Nature Reserve (BWNR), located adjacent to the fast-developing Tianjin region in China. Using an integrated geospatial framework, combining multi-temporal remote sensing, supervised classification, and a modified benefit-transfer valuation approach, we analyzed LULC transitions and the associated variations in ecosystem service values (ESVs) across three critical phases: (i) a period of minimal anthropogenic pressure and climate influence (1984–1999); (ii) a phase of increased human activities (2000–2013); and (iii) an active ecological restoration period (2014–2023). Findings across the three phases show that the LULC changes are not in equilibrium, as indicated by the decrease in vegetation (−46.43%) and bare ground (−31.34%), while the water areas (+547.50%) and built-up areas (+14.40%) increased remarkably. This indicates an intensive human-induced environmental transformation; although some ecosystem service functions degraded, the total ecosystem service value (ESV) of BWNR continued to increase due to water area expansion. The variations in ecosystem service value (ESV) in response to LULC changes resulting from anthropogenic activities and climate change were estimated, and the results show that the total ESV of BWNR was approximately CNY 10,631.1 million in 1984, CNY 15,078.7 million in 2000, CNY 17,768.3 million in 2013, and CNY 19,365.4 million in 2023. Findings from this study will contribute to the theoretical understanding of coastal wetland vulnerability and provide empirical evidence for the coordinated management of wetland ecological conservation and economic development in the context of rapid urbanization in Tianjin’s coastal areas.",

Subsequently, utilizing land-use remote sensing monitoring data from five periods (1980 to 2020), this study systematically analyzed the spatiotemporal competition characteristics of UAES in Henan Province and its impact on ESV using GIS spatial analysis method, the Geo-informatic Tupu method, and improved ESV evaluation model. The results indicate that from 1980 to 2020, Henan Province experienced a gradual shrinkage of agricultural space, rapid urban expansion, and a slight decline in ecological space. Urban encroachment on agricultural land is the primary spatial competition manifestation, which is most pronounced in the core area of the Central Plains Urban Agglomeration. This urban expansion and subsequent agricultural encroachment on ecological land are key ESV loss drivers, causing losses of USD 812.41 million and USD 1663.24 million, respectively. The indirect ESV loss from cropland displacement substantially exceeded direct losses from urban expansion. This study provides critical insights into the trade-offs between urban expansion, agricultural development, and ecological protection in agricultural regions undergoing urbanization. The findings inform spatial planning and ecological conservation strategies in Henan Province and other similar agricultural regions.",

    "Abstract": "Understanding interactions among sympatric mesocarnivore populations is essential for making sound management decisions. The golden jackal has rapidly expanded in Europe, raising questions about its potential intraguild effects. Using long-term hunting bag data (1997–2024) from Hungary, we investigated spatiotemporal population trends of the European badger, red fox, and golden jackal. We examined pairwise associations in their annual growth rates. Generalised additive models and Pearson correlation analyses revealed strong species-specific temporal and spatial trends and weak to moderate positive relationships among the species’ population growth rates at the national scale and within regions of high jackal population density. We found no evidence of jackal suppression of foxes or badgers. Additionally, badgers showed the strongest positive association with fox populations. Our large-scale analyses suggest that these mesocarnivores coexist without substantial competitive interference, likely due to local spatial heterogeneity and fine-scale temporal partitioning that are not detectable in annual, broad-scale (national) data. These findings highlight the importance of integrating broad-scale population data with finer-scale behavioural studies to better understand coexistence mechanisms in expanding mesocarnivore assemblages.",

    "Abstract": "Lower-extremity peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs) are used in critically ill adults when upper-extremity access is limited, yet real-world data on indications, dwell time, and device-related outcomes remain scarce. We retrospectively reviewed consecutive ultrasound-guided mid-thigh lower-extremity PICC placements performed under a standardized protocol (15 cm below the inguinal ligament; fixed 55-cm insertion depth) in an adult ICU and extracted indication patterns, catheter dwell time, removal reasons, and microbiological findings. Among 38 placements in 37 patients, difficult peripheral access was present in all cases; prolonged intravenous antibiotics were the predominant indication (34/38, 89.5%), followed by total parenteral nutrition (13/38, 34.2%) and vasopressor therapy (2/38, 5.3%). Median dwell time was 19.5 days (IQR 12–25; range 3–48). Catheters were most commonly removed due to death (15/38, 39.5%), discharge (13/38, 34.2%), or no longer being clinically indicated (8/38, 21.1%), while removal for suspected catheter infection/fever occurred in 2/38 (5.3%). A catheter-drawn culture was positive in 1/38 (2.6%; Candida albicans), whereas peripheral blood cultures were positive in 4/38 (10.5%). In this single-center retrospective descriptive cohort, standardized mid-thigh lower-extremity PICCs were used for prolonged venous access. Removals for suspected infection/fever evaluation were uncommon; however, CRBSI was not adjudicated and thrombosis surveillance was not performed. These findings describe local utilization patterns and support future comparative studies and stewardship-focused quality improvement.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Precise staging and tumor delineation are essential for optimizing treatment and enhancing outcomes of radiotherapy (RT). While computed tomography (CT)-based RT remains standard, fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) offers improved detection of primary and nodal disease. This study investigates the role of PET/CT in RT planning of HNSCC. Methods: Fifty-one HNSCC patients underwent radical volumetric modulated arc RT with concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy in a prospective study. Two RT plans per patient were sequentially created by a single oncologist using CT-only and PET/CT data, respectively. Planning target volumes (PTVs) for primary and nodal regions were independently defined, and dose–volume histograms were analyzed and compared. Results: PET/CT significantly affected TNM staging, increasing the T-stage in 11.8% of patients and the N-stage in 33.3%. Distant metastases were found in 9.8% of patients, leading to a redefinition of the overall treatment policy. PET/CT-based planning improved primary tumor PTV coverage (PTV4) in 37.2% (19/51) of cases. The tumor areas excluded from the CT-based planning received an average of 85.6% of the prescribed PTV4 dose (range 18–93%), while in PET/CT planning, they received 95.4% (range 93–99%) (p &lt; 0.0001). Nodal PTV areas requiring a booster dose (PTV2) were adjusted in 33.3% (17/51) of patients during PET-CT planning. These nodal areas received an average of 85.6% of the prescribed dose for PTV2 (range 18–93%) during CT planning, compared to 95.4% (range 93–99%) during PET/CT planning. There was no statistically significant difference in the dose received by organs at risk between CT- and PET/CT-RT planning. Conclusions: PET/CT improves target delineation for primary tumors and lymph nodes, also allowing for dose escalation in metabolically highly active lesions in patients with HNSCC. The method also reveals occult distant metastases in a subset of patients, enabling personalized treatment strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Aiming at the key problems of the material removal rate and surface integrity of existing tools in the lapping of sapphire hard and brittle crystals, an efficient lapping tool has been developed to explore a new process for HFVCD (hot filament chemical vapor deposition) diamond tools to efficiently lap sapphire wafers. With the premise of ensuring the surface roughness of the wafer is Ra ≤ 0.5 μm, the material removal rate is increased to more than 1 μm/h. To explore a high-efficiency lapping process for sapphire wafers using HFCVD diamond tools. The influence of key preparation parameters on the surface characteristics of CVD (chemical vapor deposition) diamond films was systematically investigated. Three types of CVD diamond coating tools with distinct surface morphologies were fabricated. These tools were subsequently employed to conduct lapping experiments on sapphire wafers in order to evaluate their processing performance. The experimental results demonstrate that the gas pressure, methane concentration, and substrate temperature collectively influenced the surface morphology of the diamond coatings. The fabricated coatings exhibited well-defined grain boundaries and displayed pyramidal, prismatic and spherical features, corresponding to high-quality microcrystalline and nanocrystalline diamond layers. In the lapping experiments, the prismatic CVD diamond coating tool exhibited the highest material removal rate, reaching approximately 1.7 μm/min once stabilized. The spherical diamond coating tool produced the lowest surface roughness on the lapped sapphire wafers, with a value of about 0.35 μm. Surface morphology-controllable diamond tools were used for the lapping processing of the sapphire wafers. This achieved a good surface quality and high removal rate and provided new ideas for the precision machining of brittle hard materials in the plane or even in the curved surface.",

    "Abstract": "The coexistence of Cu in copper sulfate electrolyte significantly affects the microstructure and performance of the copper foil. So far, there has been little quantitative analysis of Cu+ in the electrolyte during the copper foil production process. This paper fabricated a 2,2′-Biquinoline (BIQ) modified expanded graphite (EG) electrode electrochemical sensor for the selective determination of Cu+. EG, with its large specific surface area and excellent adsorption and electrochemical properties, significantly enhances analytical sensitivity. Additionally, BIQ’s specific coordination with Cu+ improves the sensor’s rapid and effective quantification of Cu+ in the electrolytic copper foil electrolyte. The linear equation of this sensor is I = 0.03769 + 0.29997 × c (R2 = 0.9989), with a detection limit of 8 μg/L (S/N = 3). The BIQ-modified EG electrode has good selectivity for Cu+, with a recovery rate for cuprous ions of 101.00% to 105.00% under the coexistence of 10,000 times Cu2+, and an RSD of less than 2%. This sensor’s efficient, sensitive, and selective detection of Cu+ can be an effective method to improve the quality of electrolytic copper foil products.",

    "Abstract": "The micro-geometry of the cutting edge plays a crucial role in material flow ahead of the cutting edge and chip formation, primarily influencing chip formation mechanisms and the minimum cutting thickness. In the context of turning 304 stainless steel, however, existing research still lacks a unified quantitative framework linking “cutting edge micro-geometry—material separation behavior (separation point/minimum uncut chip thickness)—microstructural evolution of the machined surface.” This gap hampers mechanistic optimization design aimed at enhancing machining quality. This study examines the turning of 304 stainless steel by integrating analytical modeling, finite element simulation, and experimental validation to develop a predictive model for minimum cutting thickness. It analyzes the effects of tool nose radius and asymmetric edge morphology, and a microstructure evolution prediction subroutine is developed based on dislocation density theory. The results indicate that the minimum cutting thickness exhibits a positive correlation with the tool nose radius, and their ratio remains stable within the range of 0.25 to 0.30. Under asymmetric edge conditions, the minimum cutting thickness initially increases and then decreases as the K-factor varies. The developed subroutine, based on the dislocation density model, enables accurate prediction of dislocation density, grain size, and microhardness in the machined surface layer. Among the factors considered, the tool nose radius demonstrates the most pronounced influence on microstructure evolution. This research provides theoretical support and a technical reference for optimizing cutting-edge design and enhancing the machining quality of 304 stainless steel.",

    "Abstract": "Wheelchair-mounted robotic arms (WMRAs) are assistive manipulators designed to increase the functional independence of individuals with limitations in the upper and lower extremities. While previous research has identified several visual, cognitive, and physical abilities that facilitate optimal operation of such a device, these have yet to be accounted for when designing the human–robot interface. This study investigates whether interface-level compensations can improve usability and support more personalized control across users with different abilities. Five interface compensations were implemented and evaluated: object highlighting, move suggestions, slowing near objects, a one-click approach, and a level indicator. A user study was conducted among individuals with spinal cord injury as well as able-bodied younger and older adults serving as comparison groups. Evaluations of task performance metrics, perceived WMRA usability, and user experience were conducted. The results indicate that younger adults achieved the highest task efficiency, followed closely by participants with spinal cord injury, with both groups reporting good-to-excellent usability, whereas older adults showed lower efficiency and rated the system as having fair usability. The one-click automated object approach feature was identified as the most useful compensation among all participant groups. Overall, participant feedback indicated that spatial visualization and spatial orientation were the most important individual differences affecting the operation of the arm.",

    "Abstract": "Photovoltaic (PV) systems play a significant role in renewable energy production. Due to the nonlinear and multi-modal nature of PV models, using accurate model parameters is crucial. In recent years, metaheuristic algorithms have been utilized to estimate these parameter values. While established metaheuristics like Genetic Algorithms (GAs) incorporate mechanisms such as mutation and selection to maintain diversity, they may still encounter challenges related to premature convergence when navigating the complex, multi-modal landscapes of PV parameter estimation. In this study, the performance of the previously proposed Bipolar Improved Roosters Algorithm (BIRA), which enhances search efficiency through a bipolar movement strategy to balance exploration and exploitation phases, is evaluated. BIRA is compared with the Simple GA (SGA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) in estimating the electrical parameters of a single-diode PV model using experimental current-voltage data. The experimental results demonstrate that BIRA outperforms its competitors, achieving the lowest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 1.0504 × 10−3 for the Siemens SM55 and 4.8698 × 10−4 for the Kyocera KC200GT modules. Furthermore, statistical analysis using the Friedman test confirms BIRA’s superiority, ranking it first among all tested algorithms across both datasets. These findings indicate that BIRA is a effective and reliable tool for accurate PV parameter estimation.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Patients with a prior history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who present with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) represent a complex, high-risk subgroup due to advanced comorbidity burden and challenging coronary anatomy. Whether an invasive strategy offers meaningful benefit over conservative management in this population remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to compare long-term outcomes of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) versus medical therapy in NSTEMI patients with previous CABG and to identify independent predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality. Materials and Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 286 NSTEMI patients with prior CABG (PCI: 112; medical therapy: 174). Baseline demographic, clinical, laboratory, and angiographic characteristics were assessed. The primary endpoint was MACE, while the secondary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Kaplan–Meier analysis evaluated survival differences, and multivariable Cox regression identified independent predictors. Results: During follow-up, MACE rates were comparable between PCI and medical therapy (14.3% vs. 18.9%; p = 0.305). All-cause mortality was likewise similar (9.8% vs. 10.3%; p = 0.541). Kaplan–Meier analysis showed no survival benefit with PCI (log-rank p = 0.334). Hypoalbuminemia independently predicted both MACE and mortality, while CKD and HF were major determinants of long-term mortality. Conclusions: In NSTEMI patients with prior CABG, no long-term superiority of PCI over medical therapy was observed with respect to MACE or mortality. Prognosis appears more closely linked to hypoalbuminemia, CKD, and HF than to the chosen management strategy. These findings underscore the importance of individualized and risk-adapted clinical decision-making in this complex population.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological disorder causing physical, cognitive, and psychological impairments that affect daily functioning and quality of life (QoL). Psychological distress, cognitive deficits, and reduced physical activity often co-occur, yet their associations with QoL across disability levels are unclear. This study examined these relationships in people with relapsing–remitting MS, stratified by disability severity. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study included 149 adults with RRMS. Disability severity was classified as mild, moderate, or severe using the Patient-Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) scale. Psychological distress was assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale–21 (DASS-21), cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and physical activity using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). QoL was evaluated using the Multiple Sclerosis International Quality of Life (MusiQoL) questionnaire. Stratified comparative analyses were conducted to examine differences in overall and domain-specific QoL according to levels of psychological distress, cognitive function, and physical activity within disability categories. Results: In participants with mild and moderate disability, higher levels of depression, anxiety, and stress were associated with lower QoL scores, particularly in domains related to activities of daily living, psychological well-being, and symptoms. Higher cognitive function and greater physical activity were associated with more favorable QoL across several domains. In those with severe disability, associations between psychological distress and QoL were less consistent, although stress remained associated with selected QoL domains. Conclusions: Psychological distress, cognitive function, and physical activity show distinct patterns of association with daily functioning and QoL across disability levels in RRMS. Although causal inferences cannot be drawn from this cross-sectional design, disability-stratified analyses provide clinically relevant insights into how these factors co-vary with QoL at different stages of disease severity.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Controlled breathing can influence autonomic regulation and haemodynamics; however, the role of its timing relative to exercise remains unclear. Materials and Methods: Fourteen healthy, physically active men (mean age 21.8 ± 0.7 years; body mass index within the normal range) participated in this randomised crossover study. Each session consisted of five 5 min cycling bouts at 50% of heart-rate reserve, interspersed with 3 min passive recovery periods. The three conditions were: control (no structured breathing), 30 s hyperventilation (approximately 30 breaths·min−1) performed before each bout, and the same hyperventilation performed after each bout. Resting heart rate variability spectra (low-frequency [LF], high-frequency [HF]) were assessed pre- and post-session; arterial blood pressure was measured stage-wise; quadriceps muscle oxygen saturation (StO2) was monitored using near-infrared spectroscopy; and a discriminant co-integration index (Dsk) was calculated to integrate multisystem responses. Results: Compared with baseline, LF power increased and HF power decreased after exercise in the control and post-exercise hyperventilation conditions (p &lt; 0.05), whereas pre-exercise hyperventilation attenuated these shifts. Post-exercise hyperventilation blunted the rise in systolic blood pressure and reduced diastolic blood pressure compared with control (p &lt; 0.05). Both breathing interventions accelerated StO2 recovery, with higher early recovery StO2 following pre-exercise hyperventilation and sustained advantages after post-exercise hyperventilation (moderate-to-extensive effects). Dsk values were consistently highest after exercise, indicating stronger and more coherent multisystem coupling. Conclusions: In this acute crossover study of healthy young men, hyperventilation performed before or after exercise induced distinct short-term cardiovascular and muscular responses, reflecting respiratory-driven modulation of haemodynamic and autonomic processes. The timing of hyperventilation influenced these responses, suggesting that deliberate hyperventilation may acutely modify exercise-related regulatory mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "Malignancy-related gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) remains a significant clinical challenge, contributing substantially to morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization in patients with cancer. Up to 10% of individuals with advanced malignancies develop GIB during their disease, and these episodes are frequently characterized by a high risk of rebleeding and poor long-term hemostatic control. Tumor-associated bleeding typically arises from friable, infiltrative, and highly vascular lesions that respond suboptimally to conventional endoscopic techniques such as thermal coagulation or mechanical clipping. These limitations underscore the need for improved diagnostic accuracy and more reliable therapeutic options. Recent advances in imaging modalities, including contrast-enhanced CT studies, have enhanced the ability to localize and characterize bleeding sources in complex oncologic cases. Parallel developments in endoscopic hemostasis—such as over-the-scope clips and contact-free coagulation devices—have expanded the therapeutic armamentarium for managing malignant bleeding. Clinically, topical hemostatic powders—particularly TC-325—represent a highly effective option for achieving rapid endoscopic hemostasis, supported by the strongest comparative evidence and the highest rates of immediate bleeding control among currently available technologies. In this review, we synthesize contemporary diagnostic approaches to GIB and place particular emphasis on the evolving and emerging therapeutic strategies for malignancy-related bleeding. We also highlight innovative technologies that are reshaping clinical practice and improving management options in this challenging clinical domain.",

    "Abstract": "Ni–Fe alloys were prepared via electrodeposition from a citrate electrolyte under different magnetic field (MF) strengths (0.1 T, 0.3 T, and 0.5 T) and configurations parallel (B‖) and perpendicular (B⊥) to the electrode surface. The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) induced by the magnetic field influences their structural, compositional, and electrocatalytic properties. The application of an external homogeneous magnetic field significantly altered the alloy morphology, composition, and crystallinity, which we investigated. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) studies reflected that moderate MF intensity (0.3 T) led to modest variation in Fe incorporation and produced smoother, denser, and more homogeneous Ni–Fe films, particularly under (B⊥), while high field strength (0.5 T) resulted in surface roughening and compositional nonuniformity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed that the perpendicular MF enhanced crystallinity and favored (111) and (200) texture growth, while parallel orientation led to weaker and broader diffraction peaks, providing less-ordered growth. Furthermore, slight variations in Fe content were observed with changes in magnetic field strength and direction. Electrochemical measurements demonstrated that the deposited Ni-Fe under various magnetic field conditions modulated both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in 1 M NaOH. For HER, the lowest overpotential (η10 = −227 mV at 10 mA cm−2) and Tafel slope (120 mV·dec−1) were obtained for the deposited Ni-Fe under (B‖) at 0.1 T, while for OER, the best catalytic performance occurred for fabricated Ni-Fe alloy under (B⊥) at 0.3 T with an overpotential value of (η10 = 320 mV, Tafel = 202 mV·dec−1). The deposited Ni-Fe alloys under both orientations exhibited reasonable stability and durability during a prolonged operation process. Overall, the findings demonstrate that controlling magnetic field orientation and intensity during electrodeposition provides a versatile route to tailor the microstructure and optimize the bifunctional electrocatalytic performance of Ni–Fe alloys for the water-splitting reaction in an alkaline medium.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are chronic metabolic disorders associated with cognitive impairment and neuronal damage. The hippocampus, a region sensitive to nutrient excess, is critical for integrating sensory and metabolic signals. This study aimed to determine the early onset of cognitive and motor deficits induced by obesity and/or hyperglycemia and to characterize associated hippocampal alterations in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats. Methods: Male ZDF rats (13 weeks old) were categorized into three groups: lean control, obese normoglycemic (ZDF-NG), and obese hyperglycemic (ZDF-HG). Assessments included zoometric parameters (weight and adiposity), biochemical assays (glucose tolerance, insulin response, and lipid profile), and behavioral tests (Open Field and Novel Object Recognition). Hippocampal health was evaluated through stereological neuronal density analysis and redox balance markers. Results: Both obese groups exhibited significant visceral adiposity and hyperlipidemia. The ZDF-HG group was further characterized by glucose intolerance, hepatic insulin resistance, and reduced β-cell function. Behavioral results showed that while obesity decreased motor activity, hyperglycemia significantly exacerbated the loss of both short- and long-term recognition memory. Histologically, obesity was associated with decreased neuronal density in the hippocampal DG and CA1 regions. Furthermore, hippocampal ROS was significantly elevated in the ZDF-HG group, and glutathione reductase activity was reduced in both obese phenotypes. Conclusions: The findings demonstrate that obesity initiates hippocampal neurodegeneration and motor decline, and that hyperglycemia severely impairs recognition memory. These results emphasize the critical interplay between metabolic dysfunction and cognitive decline, highlighting the necessity of managing both obesity and T2D to prevent early neurodegenerative changes.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Systemic low-grade inflammation is associated with steatohepatitis in adults. We aim to explore if systemic low-grade inflammation, measured by plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), is also linked to steatotic liver disease in adolescents. Methods: In the cross-sectional Early Vascular Ageing in the YOUth study, systemic low-grade inflammation was measured by hs-CRP and liver fat content was quantified by the controlled attenuation parameters (CAP) derived from FibroScan® (Echosense, Paris, France) measurements in 14- to 19-year-old Austrian adolescents. Cardiovascular risk factors and anthropometric data were collected through face-to-face interviews, physical examinations, and comprehensive fasting blood analyses. Linear regression models were performed to analyze the association between hs-CRP and CAP values. Results: A total of 1300 adolescents (64.6% female) with a mean age of 17.2 ± 1.3 years were included in this analysis. hs-CRP was significantly associated with CAP values in the simple linear regression model (b = 1.35, p = 0.044) and after adjustment for sex and age (b = 1.84, p = 0.006), suggesting an increase in systemic low-grade inflammation with increasing liver fat content. However, further adjustment for major factors of the metabolic syndrome (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index z-score, systolic blood pressure z-score) led to a loss of significance of the mentioned association (b = −0.55, p = 0.419). Conclusions: Systemic low-grade inflammation measured by hs-CRP is linked to higher liver fat content in our adolescent cohort. However, this association is largely driven by components of the metabolic syndrome and the overall metabolic milieu, rather than reflecting liver-specific inflammation.",

    "Abstract": "Calcareous soils are typically deficient in essential nutrients such as iron, phosphorus, and potassium, which frequently results in nutrient deficiency in fruit trees. Bacillus licheniformis LCDD6 markedly enhanced Malus hupehensis seedling growth and plant iron nutrition in calcareous soil. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism underlying these beneficial effects of strain LCDD6 under iron deficiency. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that iron deficiency induced metabolic reprogramming in strain LCDD6, characterized by a significant upregulation of genes involved in the biosynthesis of the siderophore bacillibactin and plant growth hormone indoleacetic acid (IAA). Consistently, metabolomic profiling identified bacillibactin and IAA as the dominant metabolites produced under iron-deficient conditions. A 60-day pot experiment further demonstrated that the cell-free fermentation broth of strain LCDD6 significantly enhanced plant growth and rhizosphere soil enzyme activities. The crude bacillibactin extract derived from the fermentation exerted the strongest effects on plant growth and iron accumulation, whereas IAA preferentially stimulated root development and promoted plant phosphorus accumulation. Additionally, different metabolites exerted distinct and selective effects on the rhizosphere microbial community, with fungi showing stronger and more metabolite-specific responses than bacteria. The crude bacillibactin extract enriched fungal taxa, particularly Coprinellus, which showed strong positive correlations with plant growth traits and iron accumulation, while Stachybotrys, enriched under IAA treatment, was positively correlated with plant phosphorus content. Overall, strain LCDD6 promotes plant growth under iron-deficient conditions through the coordinated action of multiple metabolites, with bacillibactin as the primary contributor and IAA providing complementary effects. These findings offer mechanistic insight and a scientific basis for developing Bacillus-based biofertilizers to improve nutrient acquisition in calcareous soils.",

    "Abstract": "Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used in food systems; among them, bacteriocin-producing strains have attracted attention for their potential in the biopreservation of dairy products. This study started from the detection of bacteriocin-encoding genes in eight probiotic Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides strains, previously isolated, identified, and characterized for antimicrobial activity. Results confirmed the presence of bacteriocin genes across the strains, with Ln.F5 harboring both mesB and lcnA genes, and three other strains, including the Ln.M14 strain, exclusively carrying the lcnA gene. The two strains, Ln.F5 and Ln.M14, were used, in single and mixed cultures, for the first time, as adjunct cultures in a model cheese. Their impact against Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, and Brochothrix thermosphacta, and on volatile organic compounds (VOCs), during ripening and storage, was evaluated. Results showed high viability (9.2 Log CFU/g) of Leuconostoc spp. in model cheese, up to 60 days of storage, and Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles of the re-isolated bacteria confirmed the survival of the added strains. Furthermore, results indicated the inhibition of E. coli and Listeria spp. started from the 15th day of ripening in samples differently inoculated with the two Leuconostoc strains. Listeria spp. was completely inhibited starting from 15 days by Ln.M14, in single culture. The complete inhibition of S. aureus, M. luteus, and B. thermosphacta was detected after 30 days of ripening in samples differently inoculated with Ln.F5 and Ln.M14. The VOC analyses revealed more complex aromatic profiles in samples inoculated with Leuconostoc strains, which, along with the development of cheese eyes, confirmed the effect of the Leuconostoc strains in enhancing quality traits of cheeses.",

    "Abstract": "Plant Growth-Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR), represent a promising tool for the development of sustainable agriculture practices. Although numerous strains have been described in the literature, their characterisation often overlooks the ability to sustain functional activity under common abiotic stress conditions, such as water deficit and high salinity. The present study aimed to isolate putative PGPR strains from different environmental and biological matrices, characterise their key plant growth-promoting traits, and evaluate their effectiveness in improving plant growth under water and salt stress conditions. The isolated strains were initially tested in vitro for phytohormone production, phosphate solubilisation, and siderophore production. Selected Bacillus and Pseudomonas strains exhibiting the most promising traits were tested in a preliminary greenhouse pot test using lettuce (Lactuca sativa), followed by assays under drought stress (50% water reduction) and salt stress (100 mM NaCl). The results demonstrated that the two Bacillus velezensis strains (PB_8 and CSS_12) significantly enhanced plant growth by increasing foliar biomass and root development improving pigment content, and mitigating stress-induced damage. Overall, these findings support the potential of PGPR-based strategies for low-impact agricultural practices and enhancing plant resilience under stress conditions.",

    "Abstract": "A Group A Streptococcus (GAS, Streptococcus pyogenes) is an exclusively human pathogen whose virulence is driven by a diverse array of surface structures, secreted toxins, and immune evasion mechanisms. Central to its pathogenicity is the M protein, a surface-anchored molecule that inhibits phagocytosis by interfering with complement deposition and binding host factors such as fibrinogen. GAS also secretes a wide range of toxins and enzymes that damage tissues and disrupt host defences. Streptolysin O and streptolysin S are potent cytolysins that lyse immune cells and contribute to tissue necrosis. Pyrogenic exotoxins (such as SpeA and SpeC) act as superantigens, triggering massive, dysregulated T cell activation and cytokine release, an underlying mechanism in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Additional factors like DNases and streptokinase facilitate bacterial spread by breaking down host tissue and counteracting neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Immune evasion is further supported by the production of enzymes that interfere with complement functions, like the cleavage of chemokines and the targeting of antibodies. Together, these virulence determinants allow GAS to cause a wide spectrum of diseases, ranging from uncomplicated pharyngitis and impetigo to invasive conditions like necrotising fasciitis and sepsis. This review provides a timely overview of the important GAS virulence factors and an update on the current vaccine landscape.",

    "Abstract": "Chlamydia suis, a close relative of the human pathogen C. trachomatis, can be detected in the porcine gut, yet its prevalence and viability across intestinal segments remain poorly defined. This study aimed to assess the segment-specific prevalence, isolation success, and tetracycline susceptibility of C. suis in grower-finisher pigs. Jejunal, ileal, and colonic samples (n = 200 per intestinal segment) were collected from 600 pigs at slaughter and analyzed using C. suis-specific real-time PCR and culture. PCR revealed significantly higher detection rates in the colon (40%) than in the jejunum or ileum (both 4.5%), accompanied by significantly higher calculated bacterial loads in colonic samples. In contrast, viable C. suis was most frequently isolated from ileal material, indicating that the ileum may provide a more favorable condition for active bacterial replication. Among 24 culture-confirmed isolates, 75% were susceptible to tetracycline (MIC/MBC &lt; 2 µg/mL), 12.5% exhibited an intermediate phenotype (2 µg/mL &lt; MIC/MBC &lt; 4 µg/mL) and another 12.5% were resistant (MIC/MBC &gt; 4 µg/mL). Intermediate phenotypes were recovered from the jejunum and ileum, whereas resistant isolates were found in the ileum and colon. These findings suggest that the porcine colon may serve as an intestinal reservoir for C. suis, while the ileum supports more robust bacterial replication. Overall, these data contribute to our understanding of the intestinal ecology of C. suis under field conditions and its tetracycline susceptible patterns.",

    "Abstract": "This study presents the first documented case of a disease syndrome in cultured largefin longbarbel catfish (Hemibagrus macropterus). The condition is characterized by massive abdominal pseudotumor formation, severe cachexia, and functional gonadal arrest. Comprehensive pathological investigation revealed that the pseudotumor was encapsulated by fibroblasts and primarily composed of host-derived, poorly differentiated hyperplastic cells, interspersed with invasive, basophilic Type III cells. These cells and associated inflammatory–fibrotic lesions were also disseminated in the gill, kidney and spleen. Systematic diagnostic approaches, including microbiology and transmission electron microscopy, found no evidence of conventional bacterial or viral pathogens. Metagenomic analysis further supported these findings and suggested a link to infection by an as-yet-unidentified eukaryotic parasite, with Microsporidia or Ichthyosporea being the primary candidates. Functional (KEGG) profiling of the pseudotumor tissue further revealed a molecular signature consistent with active cellular proliferation and metabolism. We propose that the pseudotumor acts as a metabolically active “nutrient sink,” driving the systemic catabolism that underlies the severe cachexia and reproductive arrest. This work provides the first case of a eukaryotic parasite-induced pseudotumorous syndrome in fish, which represents an emerging threat to conservation aquaculture and offering novel insights into parasite-mediated host metabolic hijacking and tumor-mimicry.",

    "Abstract": "Sulfide-bearing iron oxide deposits consisting of magnetite and silicates are common within the greenstones of north-west Finland and northern Sweden. These iron oxide deposits have variable copper, gold, and uranium content and occur in association with tuffite, black schist, and dolomitic marble. The deposits have a resource size of up to 145 Mt and an iron content of 35%–50% (e.g., Stora Sahavaara). The total sulfur content of these deposits is typically in the range of 1%–5% but can have exceptional values up to 20.8%, and disseminated pyrite, pyrrhotite, and chalcopyrite are commonly present. The prediction of acid rock drainage and metal leaching potential requires a detailed understanding of the site-specific rates and mechanisms of weathering. This has been obtained through geochemical (multi-element analysis and acid–base accounting) and mineralogical characterization testing undertaken on representative materials, including multi-element analysis, acid–base accounting, net acid generation testing, and humidity cell testing. Despite the high sulfide content and low neutralizing potential of most rock types found in these deposits, the humidity cell tests showed a delayed onset to acid generation, which is primarily attributed to sulfide crystallinity and mafic silicate dissolution leading to slow oxidation and reaction rates. The need for long-term kinetic testing is evident from the Hannukainen amphibole and schist rock types. This study provides an overview of the environmental geochemistry of the skarn-hosted sulfide-bearing iron oxide deposits in Scandinavia. These deposits show potential for acid generation but due to the buffering reactivity of mafic silicates and the high crystallinity of the sulfides, the rate of acid generation is slow and the onset of these conditions delayed by mineral buffering.",

In this paper, the quercetin-loaded hybrid hydrogels (SSA-QRs) were fabricated using silk fibroin (SF), alginate, and silver-doped reduced graphene oxide (Ag@rGO) nanosheets, incorporating quercetin-encapsulated PF-127 (PF127-QR) micelles. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirmed that the fabricated hybrid hydrogels possessed an interconnected porous microstructure. The mechanical properties of hydrogels could be regulated by adjusting the content of incorporated Ag@rGO nanosheets and PF127-QR micelles. Furthermore, the obtained SSA-QR hydrogels displayed the expected swelling properties, and the swelling rates could reach 1200–1700% in 120 min, in the equilibrium state. The fabricated SSA-QR hydrogels possessed apparent conductivity and self-healing ability. In addition, SSA-QR hydrogels exhibited strong adhesive performance on the surface of different materials, including skin, metal, wood, plastic, and glass. The typical antibacterial testing using Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) confirmed the excellent antibacterial activities of SSA-QR hydrogels. Moreover, SSA-QR hydrogels displayed good antioxidant ability and intracellular ROS scavenging ability. However, the increased content of Ag@rGO nanosheets could cause a great increase in the hemolysis ratio for SSA-QR hydrogels. Fluorescent images, cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, and cell scratch testing confirmed their excellent cytocompatibility and cell pro-migration ability. The available results demonstrated a facile strategy to prepare the quercetin-loaded hydrogel for applications of wound hydrogel dressing and bio-adhesives.",

    "Abstract": "The tardigrade Ramazzottius varieornatus exhibits extraordinary resilience to extreme environmental stresses, yet the functional diversity of its proteome remains largely unexplored. In this study, the structural and biochemical characterization of RvCA5, an atypical α-carbonic anhydrase (CA) identified in R. varieornatus, is presented. Expression analysis in E. coli revealed the spontaneous formation of a truncated RvCA5 species, which was confirmed to be unrelated to signal peptide cleavage. RvCA5 exhibited distinct structural features, including extended intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at both termini. Unlike canonical α-CAs, RvCA5 exhibited negligible CO2 hydration activity, which was partially enhanced by the removal of the N-terminal IDR, suggesting that this region acts as a dynamic entropic barrier hindering substrate diffusion. RvCA5 possesses multiple surface-exposed reactive cysteine residues, resembling the redox-sensing human CA 3. Notably, consistent with a predicted nuclear localization signal, in silico modeling predicted that RvCA5 can bind DNA via a positively charged patch near the C-terminal IDR. The DNA-binding capability of RvCA5 was experimentally demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Collectively, these findings suggest that RvCA5 potentially functions as a redox-responsive transcriptional regulator.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Caloric restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention based on limiting calories relative to the basic energy needs of the organism, which changes the intensity of metabolism, causes changes in the functioning of the endocrine and sympathetic systems, and influences the expression of genes in muscle, heart, and brain cells. During the use of CR, there is a transition from carbohydrate supply to increased fat metabolism. Fatty acids are more or less susceptible to free radicals, depending on their molecular structure. Oxidation (peroxidation) contributes to the production of metabolites (including hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid), some of which are involved in inflammation. Methods: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term caloric restriction on the tissue levels of selected fatty acids and fatty acid-derived lipid mediators with pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory properties in skeletal muscle and intestinal tissues. The study was carried out on C57BL/6 mice. During the 8-month experiment, the mice in the study group were fed a 30% calorie restricted diet—according to the Every-Other-Day Diet concept. Analyses were performed on intestinal and muscle tissues collected from animals. Fatty acid derivatives were isolated using solid-phase extraction (C-18 columns) columns, and isolation of fatty acids was performed using a modified Folch method. The compounds were analyzed by liquid and gas chromatography. Results: CR induced detectable alterations in both fatty acid profiles and lipid mediator concentrations in a tissue-specific manner. However, most of these changes did not remain statistically significant after multiple testing correction. Conclusions: These findings suggest potential effects of long-term CR on lipid signaling pathways, although the current dataset lacks the statistical power required to draw definitive conclusions. This study highlights the need for further research using larger sample sizes and integrated multiomic approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying lipidomic adaptations to prolonged caloric restriction.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Challenging behaviour post-stroke can complicate care and disrupt rehabilitation, yet its presentation and management are underreported. This study explored how such behaviours were documented in clinical records and managed in stroke settings, and how care delivery and discharge outcomes were documented in this context. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted across two NHS stroke units, covering all admissions between March and April 2022. Patient records were reviewed to capture demographic, clinical, and behavioural information, together with details relating to management and discharge. Challenging behaviour was identified retrospectively from clinical documentation during routine care. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data. Results: Forty-eight stroke admissions were examined, with challenging behaviour documented in thirteen patients (27%). Eleven had ischaemic stroke, with moderate severity common (n = 6), while inattention/neglect (n = 5) and infection (n = 4) were also documented. Behaviours were commonly recorded as confusion or agitation, and predominantly by nursing staff. Challenges to care delivery were documented in six of these patients, and additional professional input was provided for seven. Discharge delays were documented in patients with challenging behaviour, and the median length of stay was notably longer for this group (19 days compared with 7). Documentation of cognitive or delirium screening was uncommon. Conclusions: Challenging behaviour was documented in over a quarter of acute stroke admissions and was documented alongside greater care complexity and longer hospital stays. These preliminary descriptive findings from a small sample indicate a need for further exploration to better characterise challenging behaviour following stroke and its implications for care.",

    "Abstract": "Nutritional deficiencies and metabolic alterations are common complications following bariatric surgery, requiring often lifelong monitoring and supplementation. The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate whether a structured follow-up can mitigate micronutrient deficiencies and metabolic changes. This study was conducted at Cannizaro Hospital (Catania, Italy), a national referral center accredited by SICOB (Italian Society for Bariatric and Metabolic Surgery). The cohort included patients who underwent bariatric surgery who completed one year follow-up between October 2022 and May 2024. Medical records such as anthropometric, clinical and laboratory data were collected for each patient at five different timepoints: baseline, 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months post-surgery. Serum levels of iron, hemoglobin, vitamin D, folate, vitamin B12 and uric acid were analyzed to assess nutritional and metabolic status over time. One-year follow-up adherence of the patient cohort was equal to 97.5%. A significant increase in serum iron, vitamin D and folate levels was observed one year after surgery. Hemoglobin and vitamin B12 levels remained stable over time. Uric acid showed a significant rise at 1 month after surgery, followed by a progressive reduction by 12 months. This study highlights the importance of a structured follow-up program after bariatric surgery, contributing to the prevention of common postoperative complications.",

    "Abstract": "We investigate primordial black hole (PBH) production via the collapse of supercritical domain walls in a quadratic f(R)-gravity model with tensor extensions. The effective field theory for an extra space’s scalar curvature provides a foundation for the formation of these dense walls. In our work, domain walls are found to be supercritical. Their properties were extensively studied in the literature, where it was demonstrated that they create wormholes and escape into baby universes through them. Closure of the wormhole leads to black hole creation, providing a mechanism for the production of primordial black holes in our model. We calculate the mass spectrum of such black holes and mass distribution within clusters of them. When accretion is accounted for, the black holes produced under this mechanism present viable dark matter candidates.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Zika virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is associated with congenital malformations and neuroinflammatory disorders, highlighting the need to identify host factors that shape infection outcomes. Macrophages, key targets and reservoirs of ZIKV, orchestrate both antiviral and inflammatory responses. Methods: Vitamin D (VitD) has emerged as a potent immunomodulator that enhances macrophage antimicrobial activity and regulates inflammation. To investigate how VitD shapes macrophage responses to ZIKV, we reanalyzed publicly available RNA-seq and miRNA-seq datasets from monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) of four donors, differentiated with or without VitD and subsequently infected with ZIKV. Results: Differential expression analysis identified long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and mRNAs integrated into competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks. In VitD-conditioned and ZIKV-infected MDMs, 65 lncRNAs and 23 miRNAs were significantly modulated. Notably, lncRNAs such as HSD11B1-AS1, Lnc-FOSL2, SPIRE-AS1, and PCAT7 were predicted to regulate immune and metabolic genes, including G0S2, FOSL2, PRELID3A, and FBP1. Among the miRNAs, let-7a and miR-494 were downregulated, while miR-146a, miR-708, and miR-378 were upregulated, all of which have been previously implicated in antiviral immunity. Functional enrichment analysis revealed pathways linked to metabolism, stress responses, and cell migration. ceRNA network analysis suggested that SOX2-OT and SLC9A3-AS1 may act as molecular sponges, modulating regulatory axes relevant to immune control and viral response. Conclusions: Despite limitations in sample size and experimental validation, this study provides an exploratory map of ncRNA–mRNA networks shaped by VitD during ZIKV infection, highlighting candidate molecules and pathways for further studies on host–virus interactions and VitD-mediated immune regulation.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: The industrial production of lanolin alcohol currently employs batch saponification, which suffers from high energy consumption, prolonged processing time, and excessive solid waste generation, rendering it incompatible with green chemistry principles. This study aimed to develop an efficient, sustainable saponification process by addressing these limitations through integrating large language models (LLMs) with microfluidic technology. Methods: An LLM-based intelligent agent called SapoMind (version 1.0) was constructed. SapoMind employs LLMs as its software core and a continuous-flow microreactor as the experimental platform. Its performance was enhanced through supervised fine-tuning. The system enables automated recommendation of saponification process parameters, autonomous experimental design, and automatic execution of experiments. Saponification conditions were automatically optimized considering product quality, energy consumption, material consumption, and time consumption. Results: The optimal continuous-flow saponification conditions were determined as 70 °C reaction temperature and 9 min residence time, producing lanolin alcohol complying with European Pharmacopoeia standards. Compared to batch processing, the optimized process reduced carbon emissions by 53% and solid waste by 37%, with the greenness score increasing from 82 to 93. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of LLM-driven intelligent agents in optimizing green chemical processes. SapoMind offers significant environmental and operational benefits for lanolin alcohol production.",

    "Abstract": "This review highlights the rapidly evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in transforming lung cancer care, with a specific focus on its integrated applications across diagnosis, biomarker discovery, and drug development. The novelty of this work lies in its holistic examination of how AI bridges these traditionally separate domains, from radiology and pathology to genomics and clinical trials, to create a more cohesive and personalized oncology pipeline. We detail how AI algorithms significantly enhance early detection by improving the accuracy and efficiency of pulmonary nodule characterization on computed tomography scans and enable precise cancer subtyping via computational pathology. In biomarker discovery, AI-driven analysis of radiomic features and genomic data facilitates the non-invasive prediction of tumor genotype, PD-L1 expression, and immunotherapy response, moving beyond invasive tissue biopsies. Furthermore, AI is accelerating the drug development lifecycle by identifying novel therapeutic targets and optimizing patient selection for clinical trials. The review also explores AI’s critical role in personalizing treatment regimens, including predicting outcomes for radiotherapy and immunotherapy, thereby tailoring therapy to individual patient profiles. We critically address the challenges of clinical translation, including model interpretability, data standardization, and ethical considerations, which are pivotal for real-world implementation. Finally, we contend that the future of lung cancer management hinges on robust, multi-institutional validation of AI tools and the development of trustworthy, explainable systems.",

    "Abstract": "(1) Background: Regulations governing food supplements vary considerably across countries, allowing products that are prohibited in one jurisdiction to be legally sold in another. Furthermore, online sales enable and facilitate this practice. Regarding pharmaceutical malpractice, the absence of a standardized European framework complicates the evaluation of pharmacist liability. As a result, the specific elements of the liability framework are defined by the national legislation of each Member State. The aim of our review is to map the global regulatory landscape of food supplements and to examine the pharmacist’s professional responsibilities, including instances of malpractice related to this area. (2) Methods: A literature review covering publications from January 2020 to December 2024 was performed using four databases: Scopus, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. The search retrieved 8243 records, of which 77 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria. The extracted data were organized into five main themes: pharmacist responsibility and malpractice, food supplement regulation, consumer safety, health claims, and pharmacist knowledge. (3) Results: The literature reviewed indicated a relatively low number of malpractice cases within the pharmacy profession compared to other professions. A higher incidence of cases is observed among male pharmacists and those practicing in the private sector. Notably, no cases have been identified addressing pharmacists’ responsibilities in the dispensing of food supplements. In the context of food supplement regulation, the reviewed literature highlights a lack of standardized terminology and harmonized legislation across different jurisdictions. Therefore, products may be classified differently across jurisdictions. Another observed barrier is the considerable variation in market access requirements across countries. Regarding consumer safety, several irregularities have been observed. Substantial non-compliance in both product composition and labeling has been observed, reflecting insufficient quality control measures. Concerning health claims, significant regulatory non-compliance with European Union regulations has been documented. In addition, widespread misleading advertising practices have been observed. With respect to pharmacists’ knowledge, the reviewed literature identifies several professional challenges within pharmacy practice, particularly those concerning the dispensing of food supplements. (4) Conclusions: This research offers a comprehensive analysis of the literature published over the past five years concerning pharmaceutical malpractice cases, as well as an examination of food supplement regulation and the professional responsibilities of pharmacists. A recurring barrier identified is the absence of unified regulatory frameworks worldwide. This results in uncertainty concerning the pharmacist’s professional role and responsibilities.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Pharmacology plays a central role in linking biomedical science concepts with their application in clinical practice across medical and healthcare education. Globally, the pharmacological curriculum has evolved, just like other disciplines, through the integration of case-based, problem-based, and hybrid teaching models that led to firm clinical reasoning and long-term learning. Thus, this study aims to evaluate and compare the learning outcomes of pharmacology curricula across the globe by adopting a systematic review and meta-analysis research approach. Methods: This comprehensive review was conducted with transparency and integrity in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD420251207753). Five electronic databases, including MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2000 to October 2025. The Cochrane Library tool was used for the risk of bias assessment of randomised controlled trials, while the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist was used for mixed-design, quasi-experimental, and cross-sectional cohorts. Review Manager 5.4 was used for statistical analysis. Results: Out of 3300 identified studies, 11 met the inclusion criteria, spanning 11 countries (published between 2007 and 2025). Integrated and case-based curricula significantly improved pharmacology knowledge compared to traditional lecture-based methods (SMD = 0.35; 95% CI: 0.07–0.64; I2 = 75%). Student satisfaction also favours integrated learning (OR = 1.53; 95% CI: 1.16–2.02; I2 = 46%). Most included studies were of moderate-to-high methodological quality. Conclusion: Globally, active and integrated pharmacology curricula foster greater cognitive understanding and learner satisfaction than conventional models. However, significant variability persists in resource-limited settings, leading to unequal competency in prescribing and therapeutic reasoning. Australian pharmacology programmes align broadly with international standards but require greater standardisation in assessment and experiential learning.",

    "Abstract": "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based optical fibre sensors have transformed label-free biosensing; however, single-interface evanescent field interactions continue to limit their sensitivity. This study presents a novel π-configuration optical fibre-based surface plasmon resonance sensor that greatly increases sensitivity by enabling dual plasmonic excitation on two symmetrically polished surfaces coated with optimized metallic thin films (Ag, Au, or Cu). We show, using finite element method simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics v6.3, that the π-configuration increases the interaction volume between the analyte and guided light, resulting in an enhanced sensitivity of 3300 nm/RIU for silver at refractive index (RI) 1.37–1.38, which is a 120% improvement over traditional D-shaped sensors (1500 nm/RIU). The maximum field norm for the π-configuration sensor is approximately 1.4 times greater than the maximum observed for the D-shaped SPR sensor at an analyte RI of 1.38. The sensor’s performance is evaluated using full-width half-maximum, wavelength sensitivity, and wavelength interrogation metrics. For the π-configuration sensor at an analyte RI of 1.38, the values of the FWHM, figure of merit, detection accuracy, and confinement loss were 36 nm, 94.29 RIU−1, 0.94, and 38.5 dB/cm, respectively. The results obtained are purely simulated using COMSOL. With the support of electric field confinement analysis, a thorough theoretical framework describes the crucial coupling regime that causes ultra-high sensitivity at low RI. This design provides new opportunities for environmental monitoring, low-abundance biomarker screening, and early-stage virus detection, where it is necessary to resolve minute RI changes with high precision.",

    "Abstract": "Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is a highly promising material for infrared laser protection due to the pronounced optical switching effect during its metal–insulator transition (MIT). However, due to the relatively high MIT temperature of VO2 and the low transmittance contrast before and after the MIT, practical applications face challenges in modulation depth and response time. In this study, we address these issues using a wafer-scale VO2/GaN/Al2O3 heterostructure fabricated by oxide molecular beam epitaxy. The conductive GaN interlayer enables local Joule heating of the VO2 film, permitting direct control of the MIT via an external bias with a threshold of 4.7 V. This structure exhibits a substantial resistance change of four orders of magnitude and enables adaptive limiting of a 3.7 μm laser, reducing transmittance from 60% to 10%. Our work demonstrates a practical, wafer-scale laser-protection device and introduces a pre-excitation strategy via external biasing to enhance response performance.",

We report the implementation of thermo-optic (TO) and electro-optic (EO) spectral tuning in silicon nitride Mach–Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) and micro-ring resonators (MRRs) by functionalizing the devices with a PMMA:JRD1 polymer cladding and integrating titanium tracks as heaters and electrodes. The fabricated MZIs and MRRs exhibit narrow linewidths of 25–30 pm and achieved TO tuning efficiencies of 1.7 and 13 pm/mW and EO tuning efficiencies of 0.33 and 1.6 pm/V, respectively. Closed-loop regulation using TO and EO effects enables stable half-fringe locking under environmental perturbations.

The highest yield of OPCs (up to 14% of DB) was achieved using the ethanol–acetone–water solvent mixture. Using LC-MS/MS, the OPC composition was analyzed and found to consist of dimers (m/z 577), trimers (m/z 865), and tetramers (m/z 1153). The maximum OPC content was observed in autumn samples. Mechanical pretreatment enhanced OPC accessibility by disrupting cell walls and increasing particle surface, facilitating release from the matrix and yielding up to 1.2-fold more OPCs than from untreated biomass. Quantification of 22 elements in the biomass by ICP-MS revealed low levels of toxic metals along with the presence of nutritionally relevant elements. Therefore, from a chemical safety perspective, biomass can be considered suitable for use as a source of OPCs.",

    "Abstract": "Cannabis sativa, a species within the Cannabaceae family, produces a diverse range of phytochemicals, notably cannabinoids and terpenoids, with significant physiological and pharmacological relevance. Among its phytochemicals, Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the most studied for their psychoactive and medicinal properties. However, emerging evidence indicates that chronic or excessive exposure to these phytocannabinoids may adversely affect male fertility. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the influence of C. sativa and its constituents on the male reproductive system, with emphasis on spermatogenesis, sperm function, hormonal regulation, and the role of the endocannabinoid system (ECS). Experimental and clinical studies demonstrate that cannabinoids interact with CB1 and CB2 receptors expressed in the testes, epididymis, and spermatozoa, thereby modulating testosterone synthesis, sperm motility, morphology, and capacitation. THC, in particular, disrupts the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis, leading to reduced luteinizing hormone and testosterone levels, impaired mitochondrial activity, and abnormal sperm morphology. Although CBD exhibits anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, its long-term impact on reproductive function remains uncertain. The review further highlights the complex interplay between exogenous cannabinoids and the endogenous ECS in maintaining reproductive homeostasis. Understanding these molecular mechanisms is critical for balancing the therapeutic potential of Cannabis-derived products with their reproductive risks. This knowledge could inform safe medicinal applications and contribute to the development of targeted cannabinoid-based therapies for male infertility.",

Here, root sample extracts from different geographical areas were compared based on their phytochemical profiles and biological activities. Both raw and hydrolysate extracts, as well as 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid, glycyrrhizin, and isoliquiritigenin, considered as the main licorice secondary metabolites, were screened for antiproliferative and anti-migration properties in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, A2780, HeLa, SiHa, and C33A breast and gynecological cancer cell lines. Hydrolysate extracts showed higher cytotoxicity than the raw extracts at the same final concentrations, 30 and 60 µg/mL, respectively. Among the standards, isoliquiritigenin showed the most pronounced cytotoxic activity, with inhibitory percentages exceeding 70% in each of the investigated cell lines at the lowest tested dose of 30 µg/mL. Then, the most effective extracts in the MTT assay, LIT2-H and LMO-H, were screened in a wound-healing test, demonstrating efficacy against ovarian (A2780) and cervical (C33A) cancer cell lines after 24 and 48 h of exposure.",

    "Abstract": "Microstegium vimineum (Japanese stiltgrass) is one of the most invasive plant species in the eastern United States, posing a consistent problem to practitioners working in stream restoration and often necessitating treatment using non-selective herbicides to reduce invasion. Herbicide use frequently results in collateral damage to desirable native species and can lead to reinvasion after treatment. This study evaluated alternatives to herbicide referred to collectively as cultural controls, the use of which draws conceptually from the interaction of stress and disturbance in plant communities that predicts reduced invasion and increased competitive success of native species with higher levels of environmental stress. We tested several preventative cultural approaches, including (intended stressor in parentheses): (1) canopy shade (light limitation), (2) sawdust soil amendments (short-term nitrogen limitation), (3) wood mulch soil amendments (longer-term nitrogen limitation), and (4) double seeding rates (native species competition), as well as a combination of these treatments. Over a two-year field study within a restored stream corridor, we found that high carbon: nitrogen ratio soil amendments such as sawdust were the most effective at attenuating M. vimineum invasion and that shade promoted native species competition with this invader. Our results suggest a set of best practices that stream restoration practitioners could consider during the design and construction phases of a stream restoration project, particularly on sites with increased risk of M. vimineum incursion.",

    "Abstract": "Reduced mud in the Yoro tidal flat (inner part of Tokyo Bay, Japan) consists of black and highly viscous sediment containing high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The mud is formed through the decomposition of terrestrial plants washed up on the tidal flat; however, the origin of PAHs within the mud has remained unclear. To investigate the origin of PAHs in the mud, we analyzed PAHs in the mud and fragments of terrestrial plants using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The total PAH concentrations except for perylene were comparable between the mud (336 ± 58 μg kg-dry−1) and the fragments of plants (247 ± 77–435 ± 235 μg kg-dry−1), and their compositional patterns were also similar. These results indicate that the high levels of PAHs in the mud primarily originated from the fragments of plants that composed the mud. Furthermore, the perylene (Pery) concentrations in the fragments of plants were the same as or higher than those in the mud, suggesting that the formation of Pery begins in the plant tissues even before the mud was formed. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized pathway by which terrestrial plants introduce PAHs into tidal flat environments.",

    "Abstract": "Chitinases catalyze the hydrolysis of β-1,4-glycosidic bonds in chitin, a structural biopolymer synthesized by numerous organisms. Although these enzymes have been widely investigated, studies focusing on insect-derived chitinases remain limited. In this study, three recombinant chitinases from the leaf-cutter ant Atta sexdens were cloned, expressed in Pichia pastoris, and biochemically characterized. The enzymes-AsChtII-C2B3 (one catalytic and three chitin-binding domains), AsChtII-C3C4 (two catalytic domains), and AsChtII-C5B1 (one catalytic and one binding domain), exhibited optimal activity at pH 4–5 and 50 °C using colloidal chitin as substrate. Chitinase activity on colloidal α-chitin was confirmed by 1H NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy, revealing GlcNAc concentrations of 0.41, 0.48, and 0.56 mmol L−1 for AsChtII-C3C4, AsChtII-C2B3, and AsChtII-C5B1, respectively. Their antifungal activities were evaluated against the human pathogens Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, as well as the phytopathogen Lasiodiplodia theobromae. Distinct inhibition profiles were observed: AsChtII-C5B1 (150 µg/mL) showed the highest activity against C. albicans (87.6% inhibition), while AsChtII-C3C4 (25 µg/mL) was most effective against A. fumigatus (60% inhibition). Notably, only AsChtII-C2B3 inhibited L. theobromae growth, inducing severe hyphal deformations observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These findings demonstrate that recombinant A. sexdens chitinases exhibit species-specific antifungal properties, underscoring their potential as biotechnological tools for medical and agricultural applications.",

    "Abstract": "Sequential ultrasonic spot welding is an interesting joining method for overlapping thermoplastic composite structures. In the framework of the EU Clean Aviation Multi-functional Fuselage Demonstrator (MFFD) and the lower shell SmarT multifunctional and INteGrated TP fuselage (STUNNING) projects, SAM XL and TU Delft Aerospace Engineering collaboratively developed and demonstrated a robot-based sequential ultrasonic spot welding process for the sub-assembly of structural frames and clips in a fuselage section demonstrator. This full-scale thermoplastic composite fuselage section demonstrator, which was recently awarded the 2025 JEC Innovation award, measures 8.0 m in length and 4.0 m in diameter. Our robot-based sequential ultrasonic spot welding technology played an important role in ensuring the joining of structural clips and frames in the stiffened fuselage skin of the demonstrator, through the use of more than 1600 spot welded joints with an average welding time of approximately 10 s per spot, thereby significantly reducing cycle times as compared to traditional joining methods such as fastening or riveting. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the technology development process and highlights the results achieved during the sub-assembly of the demonstrator, as well as the challenges encountered.",

    "Abstract": "Shearers and roadheaders are critical equipment in coal mining and roadway excavation, where the rock-breaking performance of cutting picks directly influences operational efficiency and economic outcomes. Complex geological conditions, such as hard coal seams and embedded inclusions like gangue or pyrite nodules, pose significant challenges to cutting efficiency and tool wear. This study presents a numerical investigation into the rotational cutting process of a single pick in heterogeneous coal seams using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method integrated with a mixed failure model. The model combines the Drucker–Prager criterion for shear failure and the Grady–Kipp damage model for tensile failure, enabling accurate simulation of crack initiation, propagation, and coalescence without requiring explicit fracture treatments. Simulations reveal that cutting depth significantly influences the failure mode: shallow depths promote tensile crack-induced spallation of hard nodules under compressive stress, while deeper cuts lead to shear-dominated failure. The cutting pick exhibits periodic force fluctuations corresponding to stages of compressive-shear crack initiation, propagation, and spallation. The results provide deep insights into pick–rock interaction mechanisms and offer a reliable computational tool for optimizing cutting parameters and improving mining equipment design under complex geological conditions. A key finding is the identification of a critical transition in failure mechanism from tensile-dominated spallation to shear-driven fragmentation with increasing cutting depth, which provides a theoretical basis for practitioners to select optimal cutting parameters that minimize tool wear and energy consumption in field operations.",

The essential oil, obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC-MS, contained eucalyptol (24.11%), spathulenol (16.90%), α-pinene (11.76%), and caryophyllene oxide (10.07%) as main constituents. Antibacterial activity was determined by Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), with inhibition observed only for Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 10 mg/mL; MBC 5 mg/mL). OCp reduced biofilm biomass and CFUs in most strains, particularly in S. aureus and Escherichia coli. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) showed membrane damage in treated cells. Overall, OCp displayed promising antibacterial and antibiofilm potential, representing the first report of such activity for this essential oil.",

    "Abstract": "Background: One method for the radiation therapy of rectal cancer is to set patients supine and treat them with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). The posterior skin dose is of concern due to undesirable bolusing from mounting surfaces the patient lays upon, namely the carbon fiber couch (CFC). The posterior skin dose may be mitigated by positioning the patient on top of a low-density material that separates the patient from the CFC. Purpose: Our objective was to determine the reduction in the posterior surface dose when a mattress or foam board is used to prop the patient away from the CFC. Materials and Methods: Three clinical rectal cancer patient VMAT plans were selected. A solid water phantom with optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) placed at the posterior surface was mounted using three setups: directly on the CFC, with a mattress on the CFC, and with a 10 cm thick foam board on the CFC. The three VMAT plans were delivered to this phantom, with OSLDs measuring the posterior surface dose with each setup. In the treatment planning system (TPS), the CFC only, mattress, and foam board setups were simulated on the patient’s anatomy with posterior surface doses reported. Results: The OSLD measurements in the phantom showed that the mattress reduced the posterior surface dose on average by 1.3%, and the foam board reduced the dose by 8.3%. The TPS estimates demonstrated that, on average, the mattress reduced the surface dose by 15.8%, and the foam board reduced the dose by 33.0%. It is likely that the TPS had limitations accurately modeling the surface dose, so OSLD measurements were closer to clinical reality. Conclusions: The mattress does not reduce the posterior skin dose enough to warrant its use as a skin sparing device. The CFC produces a bolusing effect that can be reduced by separating the patient from the CFC with a 10 cm thick foam board.",

    "Abstract": "The pursuit of alternatives to nonrenewable materials has stimulated the development of sustainable materials with improved performance, particularly polymer composites reinforced with plant-based fibers. In this study, eucalyptus fibers were thermally treated and evaluated as eco-friendly reinforcements for polyester composites, aiming to enhance their physical and mechanical properties. The fibers were subjected to heat treatments between 140 and 230 °C in a Macro-ATG oven, followed by analyses of anatomical characteristics and chemical composition. Composites containing 25% fiber reinforcement were produced using an orthophthalic unsaturated polyester matrix catalyzed with methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, with untreated fibers used as references. Thermal treatment induced significant modifications in fiber morphology and composition, including increases in cell wall fraction at 170 and 200 °C and higher cellulose contents at 140 and 170 °C. Mechanical performance was assessed through tensile, flexural (modulus of rupture—MOR), modulus of elasticity (EB), and impact tests. Composites reinforced with heat-treated fibers exhibited lower apparent density and, notably, those treated at 230 °C showed markedly reduced water absorption and enhanced tensile strength compared with the control. Overall, treatment at 230 °C proved most effective, highlighting the potential of thermally modified eucalyptus fibers as viable reinforcements for high-performance, bio-based polymer composites.",

    "Abstract": "This article examines the concepts of war and peace through the lens of Christian philosophy, integrating anthropological, ethical, and socio-political perspectives. It argues that while conflict is rooted in human biology and social organization, war is not a biological necessity but a culturally constructed phenomenon shaped by ideology, power structures, and moral judgment. Drawing on insights from ethology, political theory, and Christian moral theology, the study analyzes the causes of war in modern mass societies, including nationalism, global capitalism, media influence, and environmental degradation. Central attention is given to the Christian tradition’s balanced approach to war and peace, particularly its articulation of just war theory as a middle path between pacifism and militarism. The article contends that war is inherently irrational, though occasionally morally permissible as a penultimate resort aimed at restoring just peace. Ultimately, it presents Christian ethical messianism as a coherent normative framework for evaluating armed conflict, assigning responsibility, and fostering a durable peace grounded in human dignity, justice, and the moral order.",

While often associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), optic neuritis has been reported in the context of various infectious and inflammatory conditions, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Case Presentation: We describe a case of bilateral optic neuritis that led to the diagnosis of acute HIV infection in a young man actively engaged in bodybuilding, anabolic steroid use, and high-risk sexual behavior. The patient initially presented with an acute onset of vision loss, headache, and photophobia. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings confirmed demyelination of the optic nerves, and laboratory workup revealed acute HIV-1 infection. The patient improved following high-dose corticosteroids and initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Conclusions: This case highlights the need to consider systemic infections such as HIV in atypical presentations of optic neuritis.",

    "Abstract": "Many companies in the mining industry include decarbonization of production among their key strategic goals as part of their internal sustainability strategy. This need is driven by a number of factors: stricter regulation in the area of carbon footprint (introduction of carbon taxes, emissions quotas, reporting requirements); sustained growth in demand for electricity and rising market prices; economic feasibility—the need to optimize operating costs and improve energy efficiency. This study provides a comprehensive technical and economic justification for implementing a hybrid power supply system—combining a solar power plant (SPP) and a gas engine power plant (GPP)—at Solidcore Resources’ Varvarinsky hub in Kazakhstan. The methodology includes modeling the energy balance of the real asset (156.9 GWh of annual energy consumption), calculating the output of a 22.6 MW SPP based on local GHI/PR/η parameters, forming and determining the adaptability coefficient Kₐ (proportion of PV in total monthly electricity generation), conducting an economic assessment (NPV, payback period, sensitivity), and inventorying CO2 emissions under Scope 1–2. The SPP provides approximately 41.3 GWh of electricity generation per year, with an average annual Ka = 0.263; the 40 MW installed capacity of the gas piston power plant covers the residual demand, forming a stable daily and seasonal balance. The project demonstrates a positive NPV (After Tax) = USD 23.65 million with an estimated payback period of 10 years, while the cost of energy in extraction and processing is reduced by almost three times, and the total reduction in CO2 emissions will be 51%. Thus, hybridization of energy supply systems is a practical compromise between reliability and decarbonization. Determining the adaptability coefficient Ka allows the flexibility of the system to be taken into account, shows how effectively the new energy system uses renewable energy sources, and can be used to optimize the operation of the energy system to achieve the company’s internal sustainable development goals.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate characterization of river channel geometry is essential for hydrological and hydraulic analyses, yet the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry introduces challenges related to uneven point density, shadow-induced data gaps, and spurious outliers. This study proposed a novel approach for reconstructing 3D river channels from UAV-derived point clouds, emphasizing K-nearest neighbor local regression (KLR), and compared it with the LOWESS model. Method performance was examined through controlled simulations of trapezoidal, triangular, and U-shaped synthetic channels, where KLR consistently preserved morphological fidelity and produced lower RMSE than LOWESS, particularly at channel bends and bed undulations, while a neighborhood selection heuristic approach demonstrated robust results across varying data densities. Synthetic channel experiments show that the proposed K-nearest-neighbor local linear regression (KLR) method achieves RMSE values below 0.06 all tested geometries. In contrast, LOWESS produces substantially larger errors, with RMSE values exceeding 0.9 across all channel shapes. Subsequent application to two South Korean field sites reinforced these findings. In the data-scarce Migok-cheon stream, KLR effectively interpolated missing surfaces while maintaining geomorphic realism, whereas LOWESS generated over-smoothed representations. Within the dense Ogsan Bridge dataset, KLR retained small-scale bed features critical for hydraulic simulations and cross-sectional delineation, while LOWESS obscured local variability. Conclusively, the results demonstrate that KLR provides a more reliable and computationally efficient framework for UAV-based 3D river channel reconstruction, with clear implications for hydraulic modeling, flood risk management, and the advancement of digital-twin systems in operational hydrology.",

    "Abstract": "Quality of life, as an essential component of sustainable development, is particularly relevant in transnational contexts characterized by deep inequalities in human development, equity, and social well-being. The objective of this paper is to analyze the temporal and spatial changes in transnational patterns of quality of life observed between 2018 and 2025, taking into account levels of human development. To this end, multivariate statistical techniques were applied: partial triadic analysis, which allows the identification of both the common structure of the data and the temporal evolution of the indicators, together with the HJ-Biplot and cluster analysis, which provide a multidimensional and interpretable visualization of country profiles. The results reveal consistent configurations of quality of life, largely aligned with levels of human development, and highlight persistent inequalities in environmental quality, economic accessibility, and objective well-being. These findings are relevant for the formulation of policies aimed at enhancing population well-being, particularly in countries facing structural constraints despite their high levels of development. The contribution of this research lies in its three-dimensional, dynamic, and reproducible approach, which makes it possible to identify regional contrasts that are not visible through traditional methods based on unidimensional indicators or cross-sectional analyses.",

    "Abstract": "In the development of multi-vehicle cooperative hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation platforms based on machine vision, accurate vehicle pose estimation is crucial for achieving efficient cooperative control. However, monocular vision systems inevitably suffer from limited fields of view and insufficient image resolution during target detection, making it difficult to meet the requirements of large-scale, multi-target real-time perception. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an engineering-oriented multi-camera cooperative vision detection method, designed to maximize processing efficiency and real-time performance while maintaining detection accuracy. The proposed approach first projects the imaging results from multiple cameras onto a unified physical plane. By precomputing and caching the image stitching parameters, the method enables fast and parallelized image mosaicking. Experimental results demonstrate that, under typical vehicle speeds and driving angles, the stitched images achieve a 93.41% identification code recognition rate and a 99.08% recognition accuracy. Moreover, with high-resolution image (1440 × 960) inputs, the system can stably output 30 frames per second of stitched image streams, fully satisfying the dual requirements of detection precision and real-time processing for engineering applications.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the link between changes in physical activity (PA) measured by wearable accelerometers and the worsening of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) symptoms over two years. Using data from 782 participants in the Osteoarthritis Initiative accelerometer sub-study, PA was tracked with hip-worn ActiGraphs. Participants were classified as “worsening” if their Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) total score increased by &gt;10 points and as “stable” otherwise. PA was categorized into daily counts and minutes spent in various intensity levels, and analyzed in 3 h intervals across the day. Of the participants, 123 (15.7%) experienced worsening symptoms. At baseline, both groups had similar characteristics aside from slower sit-to-stand times in the worsening group. Over two years, the worsening group had a greater decline in total daily activity counts (−18% vs. −10%) and more significant reductions during late afternoon and evening (15:00–21:00; −21% vs. −6%). This group also showed a notable decrease in gait speed, longer sit-to-stand times, and a trend towards greater medial joint space narrowing. These findings suggest that larger declines in PA, especially in activities in the late afternoon and evening, are associated with worsening KOA symptoms, although causality cannot be established.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a high-accuracy and robust multi-object tracking method for maritime vessel detection and tracking in complex marine environments, characterized by dense targets, large-scale variations, and frequent occlusions. The proposed approach adopts an enhanced YOLOv8-based detector with lightweight feature enhancement and attention mechanisms to improve its capability in detecting small-scale vessels and complex scenes. Furthermore, a tracking framework combining BOTSORT with an OSNet-based re-identification (ReID) model is employed to achieve stable and reliable vessel association. Experimental results on the Near-Infrared On-Shore (NIR) dataset demonstrate that the proposed method improves Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5, and mAP@0.5:0.95 by approximately 4.0%, 5.0%, 5.1%, and 5.4%, respectively, compared with the baseline YOLOv8, while reducing parameter count and model size by 11.6% and 6.5%. On the Visible On-Shore (VIS) dataset, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in detection accuracy and robustness, further validating its effectiveness and cross-modal generalization capability. In multi-object tracking tasks, the proposed CPM-YOLO and BOTSORT framework demonstrates clear advantages in trajectory continuity, occlusion handling, and identity preservation compared with mainstream tracking algorithms. On the NIR dataset, the proposed method achieves a competitive inference speed of 188 FPS, while running at 187 FPS on the VIS dataset, demonstrating that the accuracy improvements are achieved without sacrificing real-time performance. Overall, the proposed method achieves a favorable balance between detection accuracy, tracking robustness, and model efficiency, making it well-suited for practical maritime applications.",

    "Abstract": "Precise foot contact detection (FCD) is essential for accurate biomechanical analysis in sport performance, injury prevention, and rehabilitation. This study developed and validated an inertial measurement units (IMUs)-based algorithm for FCD during sports movements. Thirty-four healthy athletes (22.8 ± 4.1 years old) performed 90° changes of direction and sprints with deceleration. Data were collected via a force platform (AMTI, 1000 Hz) and a full-body IMU suit (MTw Awinda, Movella, 60 Hz). Two IMU-based algorithms relying on pelvis vertical velocity (PVV) and resultant foot acceleration (RFA), respectively, were tested to detect initial contact (IC) and toe-off (TO). Force platform data served as the gold standard for comparison. Agreement was quantified through median offset and interquartile range (IQR); the influence of task, sex, leg, speed, and acceleration was investigated. The PVV algorithm showed higher offset than RFA for IC detection (16.7 ms vs. 10.2 ms) with comparable IQR and a substantially higher offset for TO (102.8 ms vs. 20.4 ms). Minimal influence of co-factors emerged (variance &lt; 10%). Results were sensibly improved by combining PVV and RFA, for both IC (5.6 [70.4] ms) and TO (20.4 [78.7] ms). This algorithm offers a robust, portable alternative to force platforms, enabling accurate footstep detection and analysis of complex, sports movements in real-world environments, enhancing the ecological validity of sport assessments.",

    "Abstract": "Individualization of buildings is one of the key issues in the establishment of three-dimensional (3D) building models. Most existing individualization methods rely on inefficient manual separation, while deep learning approaches require extensive pre-training and are highly influenced by the spatial structure of the models. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method for 3D building individualization that integrates SAMPolyBuild with multiple spatial-geometric features. Leveraging the zero-shot learning capability of SAMPolyBuild, the method first performs coarse extraction of individual buildings, then refines the extraction accuracy using multiple spatial-geometric features. Innovatively, two statistical parameters—Jensen-Shannon Divergence and Earth Mover’s Distance—are introduced into the building identification process. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, experiments were conducted on the Semantic Urban Meshes (SUM) dataset. The results demonstrate that the method can effectively extract individual building models from urban oblique photogrammetric 3D models, achieving an F1-score of approximately 0.83 for buildings with typical spatial structures.",

    "Abstract": "This study aims to systematically evaluate the dynamic effects of rural–urban migration experiences during compulsory education on human capital accumulation in China from a life-course perspective, with a focus on both the short-term and long-term outcomes for migrant children and the spillover effects on left-behind children. From a life-course perspective, this study examines the nonlinear temporal effects of rural–urban migration experiences during compulsory education on the human capital accumulation of migrant children in China. Using a cohort of rural children recorded in the 2012 wave of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) and their follow-up information in the 2020 wave, an endogenous switching model is constructed for empirical analysis. The results show that: (1) Rural–urban migration during compulsory schooling has a negative short-term impact on the human capital accumulation of migrant children, while its long-term effects remain positive. (2) Social integration difficulties, reflected in declines in self-efficacy and social trust, constitute the negative mechanism, although this influence weakens as migration duration increases. In contrast, improvements in public education quality, enhanced family educational processes such as increased parental time investment, and gains in non-cognitive abilities including higher self-educational expectations and better mental health serve as the positive mechanisms. (3) Rural migrant children cause negative spillover effects concerning the human capital accumulation of left-behind children because the outflow of students reduces the educational accessibility of left-behind children through distance effects and lowers the quality of rural primary and secondary schools through scale effects.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the influence of toxic language in hate speech targeting immigrants, particularly through narrative formats like first-person X (Twitter) threads. Hate speech, defined as promotion of hatred based on personal or group characteristics, increasingly escalates on social media, impacting public attitudes and behaviors. While previous research has primarily focused on measuring the scope of hate speech through content analysis and computational methods, there has been limited attention to its effects on audiences. This study presents the results of an online experiment (N = 339) with a 2 × 2 between-subjects design that manipulates the presence of toxic language and message popularity. Results indicate that hate messages lacking toxic language promote greater identity fusion with the author of the message, which in turn increases the intention to share the message, reinforces negative attitudes toward immigrants, and increases support for harsh policies against irregular immigration. Moreover, non-toxic hate messages significantly enhance narrative transportation exclusively for individuals with conservative political views, thereby further increasing their intention to share the message. These findings highlight that subtler forms of hate speech can create strong audience connections with hostile perspectives, emphasizing the need for anti-hate campaigns to address both overt and subtle hate content.",

    "Abstract": "FTIR spectroscopy, attenuated total reflection (ATR), and diffuse reflectance (DRIFT) modalities, along with ICP–AES spectroscopy and correlation analysis, including two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS), were used for the detailed analysis of Kastanozem (chestnut) soils. Microaggregates (20–200 μm) and macroaggregates (200–1000 μm) of characteristic horizons of uncultivated (fallow) and cultivated (arable land) chestnut soils of the same origin were physically fractionated by wet sieving. The combination of these molecular and atomic spectroscopy techniques in combination with correlation analysis was able to find direct correlations between matrix-forming anions and soil organic matter (SOM) of Kastanozems. Humic substances were separated from the corresponding soil samples to reveal SOM contributions more explicitly. Microaggregates of the size fractions of 20–40 μm and 40–60 μm bore the most comprehensive information for both techniques used. Most significant differences between land-use Kastanozem samples were observed in topsoil horizons (arable P versus light-colored humic AJ horizon), and for the next pair of horizons along the profile xerometamorphic BMK horizon to structural metamorphic BM horizon. These differences included carbonate matrix and SOM amounts and composition. Topsoil arable land showed significantly smaller amounts of total organic carbon and a decrease in the share of long-chain hydrocarbons compared to fallow, which has a more distinctive character compared to similar land-use samples of Chernozem. An increase in carbonate contents with soil depth was found for both land-use samples, while the amounts and composition of the silicate matrix remained largely unchanged within the depth profile. The heterospectral 2DCOS comparison of FTIR (between horizons and land-use samples), ICP–AES (between land-use samples), and FTIR–AES (for the same sample) showed the possibility of a more reliable attribution of FTIR absorption bands and revealed the differences in the macro- and micro-aggregate elemental and SOM composition of Kastanozems.",

    "Abstract": "CPVG (Utility-scale photovoltaic generation) is expanding rapidly worldwide, yet its cumulative ecological effects remain insufficiently quantified. This review synthesizes current evidence to clarify how CPVG influences ecosystems through linked mechanisms of energy redistribution, biogeochemical cycling disturbance, and ecological responses. CPVG alters surface radiation balance, modifies microclimate, and disrupts carbon–nitrogen–water fluxes, thereby driving vegetation shifts, soil degradation, and biodiversity decline. These impacts accumulate across temporal scales—from short-term construction disturbances to long-term operational feedbacks—and propagate spatially from local to regional and watershed levels. Ecological outcomes differ substantially among deserts, grasslands, and agroecosystems due to contrasting resilience and limiting factors. Based on these mechanisms, we propose a multi-scale cumulative impact assessment framework integrating indicator development, multi-source monitoring, coupled modelling, and ecological risk tiering. A full-chain mitigation pathway is further outlined, emphasizing optimized siting, disturbance reduction, adaptive management, and targeted restoration. This study provides a systematic foundation for evaluating and regulating CPVG’s cumulative ecological impacts, supporting more sustainable solar deployment.",

Physically active college students (20 males, 20 females) completed side-hop and pelvic stability tests after a warm-up (T-1) and mobilization exercises (T0) and then following each with five 8 min runs at 70% of individualized peak velocity as the fatiguing protocol (T1–T5). No significant within-group performance differences were observed across tests (T0–T5). However, males completed more hops (p &lt; 0.001) and had shorter ground contacts (p &lt; 0.05) than females in the side-hop test with no significant sex-based stability differences. Electromyography data revealed reduced activation (p &lt; 0.05) in various muscles (gastrocnemius, vastus medialis, biceps femoris, gluteus medius, gluteus maximus, erector spinae, obliquus abdominis) under fatigue (various timepoints between T1–T5) compared to baseline (T-1) across tests. Males displayed greater relative reductions in activation (p &lt; 0.01) from pre-activation to ground contact in the gastrocnemius and biceps femoris during the side-hop test. Females exhibited reduced vastus medialis (p = 0.02) activation during the side-hop test and reduced biceps femoris (p = 0.04) activation during the pelvic stability test than males.

    "Abstract": "In Louisiana’s marsh creation projects designed to mitigate wetland loss, riverine sediments are hydraulically dredged and transported through pipelines. These dredged materials are extremely soft, with moisture contents well above 100%, resulting in significant consolidation settlements even under minimal self-weight loads. Conventional one-dimensional (1-D) oedometer consolidation tests are commonly used to assess consolidation behavior; however, they are limited to soils with much lower moisture contents. At higher moisture levels, the soft slurry tends to overflow due to the weight of the standard stainless-steel dial cap and porous stone, which together apply a seating pressure of 1.07 kPa (0.01 TSF). This study presents a modified oedometer setup utilizing 3D-printed dial caps made from lightweight materials such as polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), reducing the seating pressure to 0.21 kPa (0.002 TSF). This modification enables the testing of dredged soils with moisture contents up to 100% without overflow. Settling column tests were also integrated with the modified oedometer tests, allowing for the development of void ratio–effective stress relationships spanning from 0.02 kPa (0.0002 TSF) to 107.25 kPa (1 TSF). The results demonstrate that combining settling column and modified oedometer tests provides an effective approach for evaluating the consolidation behavior of high-moisture slurry soils.",

    "Abstract": "The combined effects of urbanization and climate warming subject cold coastal cities to summer heatwaves and winter extreme cold, yet most studies emphasize built-environment modifications for summer overheating and lack evaluation methods and planning-oriented strategies to balance seasonal trade-offs. Using Dalian as a case study, we develop a seasonal net-benefit model that quantitatively characterizes and reconciles seasonally differentiated built-environment effects on land surface temperature (LST) and interprets urban heterogeneity within the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) framework. Summer LST is mainly governed by static factors such as greenspace configuration and topography, whereas winter LST is more sensitive to development intensity and locational factors, including building density and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). Coastal areas and mountainous green corridors are net-benefit zones performing well in both seasons, while dense industrial and compact low-rise areas account for ~80% of pronounced net-penalty zones. Compact mid- and high-rise neighborhoods show more favorable structural climatic conditions but with substantial retrofit potential (Retrofit Seasonal Net-Benefit Index (R-SNBI) markedly lower than Structural Seasonal Net-Benefit Index (S-SNBI) by ~3). Large low-rise problems mainly stem from an unfavorable structure rather than insufficient greenness, whereas industrial land has greater improvement potential via blue–green spaces. The framework supports refined climate adaptation, sustainability-oriented planning, and identifying urban renewal priority areas in cold-climate cities.",

    "Abstract": "In this scientific article, a quantitative assessment is carried out of the influence of the ERTMS modernisation factor on the practical efficiency of operation and resilience of the Belgian railway lines 50A/51A with the application of methodological triangulation in the MATLAB R2025a Update 1 (25.1.0.2973910) software environment (discrete-event modelling, Petri nets, Markov reliability modelling, and correlation analysis). The modelling reveals that the scenario with an expanded level of automation increases the capacity from 18.3 to 26.0 trains over 2 h (+42.1%) and reduces the average waiting time from 1.53 min (baseline level) to 0.21 min—virtually the theoretical lower bound of zero under favourable conditions. The results of the block-occupancy analysis by means of Petri nets show that a more dynamic distribution of blocks provides higher capacity, and Markov chains reflect the reduction of the impact of control centre unavailability in developing communications and virtualisations. Spearman correlation analysis additionally shows coordinated improvement of the metrics of safety, digital protection, resilience, and performance. Relying on the modelling results, a phased roadmap is proposed, combining technical improvements (development of communication systems, readiness for automation, comparable management of rolling stock movement) with compliance with regulatory requirements and the goals of sustainable development, related to SDGs 9, 11, and 13.",

    "Abstract": "Participatory decision-making (PDM) is increasingly recognized as a critical governance mechanism for enhancing institutional sustainability in higher education. However, the internal pathways through which participation contributes to organizational learning and adaptive governance remain insufficiently understood and empirically tested. Drawing on collaborative governance and organizational learning theories, this study develops a feedback-based governance framework that links PDM, learning feedback (LF), and adaptive governance capacity within universities. This study adopts a quantitative research design and employs covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) to examine the proposed framework. The analytical strategy integrates confirmatory factor analysis, mediation analysis, moderation analysis, and multi-group comparisons to capture both internal transmission mechanisms and contextual heterogeneity. As an empirical illustration, questionnaire data were collected from 512 respondents across 32 universities in China, encompassing both research-oriented and practice-oriented institutions. The survey instruments measured respondents’ perceptions of PDM, LF, adaptive governance capacity (AGC), managerial support, and digital collaboration tools using established multi-item scales. The results show that PDM enhances adaptive governance primarily through LF, indicating that participation contributes to sustainability by operating as a perceived learning mechanism rather than a one-off procedural input. Overall, the findings suggest interpreting participatory governance as a perception-based, feedback-oriented decision–learning–adaptation process, highlighting the role of learning in adaptive university governance.",

    "Abstract": "Against the backdrop of the global sustainable development agenda and China’s “dual carbon” strategy, vocational education confronts an urgent mandate to nurture talents with professional proficiency and sustainable literacy. Thus, this study innovatively employed the sand table simulation teaching method in the secondary vocational course “Engineering Bidding and Contract Management”, integrating sustainability principles such as green procurement and life cycle cost analysis within a structured “learning–thinking–acting–reflecting” framework. The study aims to empirically explore the impact of this approach on the sustainable practice capabilities of secondary vocational students. Using a single-group pretest–posttest design, a 16-week intervention was conducted with 40 students. Data were collected via questionnaires, interviews, observations, and professional assessments, analyzed via paired t-tests. The results show that the method significantly enhanced students’ sustainable practical competencies: all posttest dimension scores exceeded pretest scores (p &lt; 0.05, Cohen’s d = 2.201). This study verifies the effectiveness of sand table simulation teaching method in sustainable education and expands its application to engineering secondary vocational courses. It also provides a situational and operational teaching paradigm and empirical support for the integration of vocational education with SDGs.",

    "Abstract": "The transition toward sustainable and resilient new-type power systems requires robust diagnostic frameworks for terminal power supply units to ensure continuous grid stability. To ensure the resilience of modern power systems, this paper proposes a multi-source domain deep Transfer Learning method for the abnormal condition diagnosis of low-voltage distribution nodes within a cloud-edge collaborative framework. This approach integrates feature selection based on the Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) algorithm with a hybrid architecture combining a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Residual Network (ResNet). Additionally, it utilizes a multi-loss adaptation strategy consisting of Multi-Kernel Maximum Mean Difference (MK-MMD), Local Maximum Mean Difference (LMMD), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to effectively bridge domain gaps and ensure diagnostic consistency. By balancing global commonality with local adaptation, the framework optimizes resource efficiency, reducing collaborative training time by 19.3%. Experimental results confirm that the method effectively prevents equipment failure, achieving diagnostic accuracies of 98.29% for low-voltage anomalies and 88.96% for three-phase imbalance conditions.",

    "Abstract": "As global climate change intensifies and the Paris Agreement advances low-carbon transformation, frequent local policy adjustments under China’s dual carbon goals have made climate-policy uncertainty a core challenge for corporate sustainability. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance has grown exponentially in international capital markets, evolving from a peripheral concept to a key investment decision-making dimension. This study uses China’s carbon peaking and neutrality policies as a quasinatural experiment, applying the difference-in-differences (DID) method to the panel data of Chinese A-share listed companies (2014–2023). Taking high-energy-consuming enterprises as the treatment group, this study identifies net policy effects via the interaction of policy and time dummy variables. The results show that carbon peaking and neutrality policies significantly suppress the ESG performance of energy-intensive firms; mediating effect tests confirm that the policy harms ESG performance by increasing uncertainty. Implications include enhancing policy transparency and predictability and optimizing resource allocation to strengthen ESG resilience. Future research should focus on micro-level policy indicators and long-term effect tracking to provide theoretical and practical support for synergizing dual carbon goals with high-quality economic development.",

    "Abstract": "A commercially available attapulgite sample (Red Attapulgite) was acid-pretreated to enhance its catalytic activity. It turned out to efficiently facilitate the dehydration of a range of substituted alcohols. The dehydration of the primary alcohol was conducted at 150–180 °C, which represents energy-saving conditions when taking into account the typical dehydration conditions of primary alcohols with temperatures of &gt;300 °C. The alkene yields obtained in this study were found to be comparable to those when utilizing commercially available montmorillonite as catalysts, thereby underscoring the potential of the acid-pretreated attapulgite as a catalyst for a variety of reactions. In a parallel study, dehydration catalyzed by a range of Brønsted acids was investigated. However, only two of these acids were found to be suitable for the dehydration of primary alcohols. Nevertheless, these acids lacked both dehydration activity and recyclability. Therefore, a recyclability study was conducted in the presence of the acid-pretreated attapulgite sample. It is remarkable that no loss of activity was found over five cycles. We hypothesize that after acid-pretreatment, a synergistic effect of the Brønsted and Lewis acid sites is the cause for the high catalytic activity of the sample.",

    "Abstract": "Newton–Raphson-Based Optimizer (NRBO) is a recently proposed metaheuristic that combines mathematical search rules with population-based optimization; however, it still suffers from an insufficient balance between global exploration and local exploitation, limited local refinement accuracy, and weak adaptability in complex optimization scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an Improved Newton–Raphson-Based Optimizer (INRBO), which enhances the original framework through a multi-strategy augmentation mechanism. Specifically, INRBO integrates three complementary strategies: (1) an adaptive differential operator with a linearly decaying scaling factor to dynamically regulate exploration and exploitation throughout the search process; (2) a quadratic interpolation strategy that exploits high-quality individuals to improve local search directionality and precision; and (3) an elitist population genetic strategy that preserves superior solution characteristics while maintaining population diversity and preventing premature convergence. The performance of INRBO is systematically evaluated on the CEC2017 benchmark suite under multiple dimensions and compared with several state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that INRBO achieves superior optimization accuracy, convergence efficiency, and robustness across unimodal, multimodal, hybrid, and composite functions, which is further confirmed by statistical significance tests. In addition, INRBO is applied to mobile robot path planning in grid-based environments of different scales, where it consistently generates shorter, smoother, and safer paths than competing algorithms. Overall, the proposed INRBO provides an effective and robust optimization framework for global continuous optimization problems and real-world engineering applications, demonstrating both strong theoretical value and practical applicability.",

At the mesoscale, the author’s discrete element method is applied to calculate the effective elastic properties of the composite material. The method was tested on problems with regular fiber placement with symmetry, which have an analytical solution.

Drawing on survey data from 299 Chinese enterprises, we employ hierarchical regression analysis with interaction terms to test the proposed hypotheses. The results reveal that all three capability dimensions significantly enhance innovation performance, with innovative capacity exerting the strongest effect. Both exploratory and exploitative learning positively moderate the capability–performance relationships, though their effects vary across capability dimensions: exploitative learning more strongly reinforces the effect of absorptive capacity, while exploratory learning more effectively amplifies the influence of innovative capacity. These findings contribute to the dynamic capabilities literature by revealing the heterogeneous performance implications of distinct capability dimensions and demonstrating how different learning modes serve as boundary conditions that shape capability effectiveness.",

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is overexpressed in aggressive PCa and may contribute to resistance mechanisms. This study evaluated the role of Gal-3 in radioresistance and assessed the effect of its pharmacological inhibition using GB1107. Methods: Parental (22RV1-P) and radioresistant (22RV1-RR) PCa cell lines were treated with GB1107. Western blotting assessed Gal-3 and Protein Phosphatase 1 alpha (PP1α) expression. Cell viability (PrestoBlue™), migration (wound assay), and clonogenic survival post-irradiation were evaluated. Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Results: Gal-3 was significantly upregulated in 22RV1-RR cells (p = 0.0237). GB1107 reduced viability and impaired migration in both cell lines. Radiosensitisation was observed in 22RV1-P cells (p &lt; 0.0001) but was not significant in 22RV1-RR cells (p = 0.1258). A non-significant increase in PP1α expression was detected in RR cells.

Collective scientific efforts are increasingly focused on elucidating PFAS toxicity mechanisms and identifying potential low-impact PFAS structures that retain the exceptional properties of this chemical class. To advance the use of in silico methods in PFAS toxicity assessment, we developed a robust modelling framework for predicting PFAS acute oral toxicity class (high or low) in rats, leveraging the enhanced capabilities of the in-house Isalos Analytics Platform. The automated machine learning (autoML) functionality was employed to optimise four ML models—k-nearest neighbours (kNN), Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and fully connected neural network (NN)—using Mold2 molecular descriptors, and to identify the top-performing model through five-fold cross-validation. The selected kNN model (k = 3) was used for predictions on the held-out testing set, achieving an accuracy of 81.5%, while a Shapley values analysis provided valuable insights into the factors influencing toxicity predictions. Furthermore, the nearest-neighbour-based methodology enabled a read-across structural analysis of PFAS similarity groups consisting of each testing set instance and its three closest neighbours in the training set. This analysis revealed a consistent association between polyaromatic and heterocyclic structural features and high acute oral toxicity. The developed, thoroughly validated read-across model is freely accessible through the INSIGHT RatTox web application as well as the INSIGHT Cheminformatics Platform in Enalos Cloud, supporting high-throughput screening of PFAS compounds and investigation of structural similarities with their nearest neighbours for enriched structural interpretation.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Alemtuzumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the 21–28 kd cell surface glycoprotein, CD52. Alemtuzumab is used as an organ anti-rejection therapy in transplant recipients. Neuro-ophthalmic adverse effects are rarely described, and, to our knowledge, accommodative spasm has not previously been reported in a transplant recipient. Case Description: A thirty-nine-year-old woman with genetically confirmed NPHP1-associated nephronophthisis, with stage F3 fibrosis, developed persistent bilateral blurred vision 72 h following alemtuzumab administration for a biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection, approximately six to seven weeks post-transplant. Initial attribution to hyperglycaemia and tacrolimus toxicity delayed recognition. Cycloplegic refraction confirmed a marked hyperopic shift (+2.75 D right eye, +2.50 D left eye) with significant improvement in visual acuity, consistent with accommodative spasm. Systemic evaluations excluded hyperglycaemia-related lens changes, calcineurin inhibitor neurotoxicity, and cytomegalovirus retinitis. MRI was not pursued in the absence of red flag neurological features, and because a definitive ophthalmic diagnosis had been made. Management and Outcome: The patient was managed expectantly, as cycloplegic refraction had already confirmed the diagnosis, and symptoms were improving. Therapeutic cycloplegia (e.g., atropine) was withheld to avoid impairing near vision and driving ability. Full resolution occurred within 4 to 6 weeks without intervention. Drug exposure to onset of symptoms was 72 h; onset of symptoms to diagnostic confirmation was 22 days; total symptom duration was 5.5 weeks, and recovery was 2 weeks after diagnosis. Conclusions: This case represents the first reported transplant case of alemtuzumab-associated accommodative spasm. Causality assessment supports a WHO-UMC classification of “Probable”, aligning with five Bradford–Hill considerations (temporality, biological plausibility, consistency, specificity, and analogy), but without statistical “strength of association” given that this is a single case report. Early cycloplegic refraction should be incorporated into the evaluation of post-alemtuzumab visual complaints, and clinicians should contribute to pharmacovigilance through structured reporting to capture these rare but important events.",

A longitudinal survey with repeated measurements was conducted in Nouakchott between May 2023 and April 2024, in order to examine the factors influencing the distribution and productivity of Anopheles larval habitats. The larvae were collected by immersion in 60 water points, once a month during the dry season and twice a month during the rainy season, for a total of 294 observations. The physical and chemical characteristics of the sites were also measured. Logistic regression analyses with random effects showed that the presence of Culex and Aedes larvae, pH, and temperature were statistically significantly associated with positive water collection for Anopheles larvae (aOR = 3.03, 95%CI [1.14–8.07], p-value = 0.026; aOR = 0.18, 95%CI [0.05–0.60], p-value = 0.006; aOR = 3.17, 95%CI [1.32–7.61], p-value = 0.010 and aOR = 5.95, 95%CI [2.09–16.92], p-value &lt; 0.001, respectively).

    "Abstract": "Changes in land use patterns due to urbanisation impact local weather patterns by influencing Land Surface Temperatures (LSTs). Despite rapid urbanisation in the Delhi-NCR (National Capital Region), the peri-urban fringes of Haryana, such as the Central Circle Forest (CCF) region, in the past three decades, a comprehensive 30-year analysis that integrates LST, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalised Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) is lacking. The current study on the decadal analysis covering the 1993 to 2023 time period shows an increase in built-up areas (14.6–38.4%), a decline in NDVI (−0.01 to −0.08), a 6 °C rise in summer LST, and weak correlations between LST and NDVI. A significant increase in summer mean LSTs was observed, with some regions reaching temperatures beyond 35 °C in the selected districts. The LST and LULC zonal statistics revealed that the open fields/agricultural land and floodplains of the Yamuna River have adversely affected the weather pattern with rising LST. The average NDVI declined from −0.01 in 1993 to −0.08 in 2023, indicating a loss of vegetative buffers. Meanwhile, NDBI trends from 2003 to 2023 showed that built-up areas have steadily grown, and LULC data highlighted 38.43% of the built-up area in 2023. Correlation analysis showed a weak negative relationship between LST and NDVI (r = −0.47), suggesting diminishing cooling effects of vegetation, while a weak positive correlation between LST and NDBI indicates that urban expansion is significantly contributing to the urban heat island effect. This study emphasises the need for green infrastructure, afforestation, and water conservation in urban planning frameworks to enhance climate resilience and ecological sustainability.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: HPV vaccination rates among U.S. young adults remain unchanged at 47% since 2019. Barriers including misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, and stigma surrounding HPV’s long-standing association with sexually transmitted infections have limited widespread acceptance among the male population. This experimental study explores how prevention messages incorporating an emotional flow element may influence vaccination intention. It also examines whether vaccination status may differentiate pre-exposure risk-taking tendencies and vaccine perceptions—as well as post-exposure HPV susceptibility, HPV severity, vaccine effectiveness, and emotional response—among young adults. Methods: A one-factor between-subjects experiment (including facts-only vs. facts→threat vs. facts→threat→hope conditions) was conducted online with a group of Gen Z college students at a U.S. university (N = 440). Results: ANCOVA results indicated that emotional flow embedded in the three message conditions did not result in significantly different emotional responses (across all participants) or vaccination intention among the unvaccinated participants. Whereas vaccinated participants reported greater perceived vaccine benefits, HPV susceptibility, HPV severity, and vaccine effectiveness, unvaccinated participants exhibited stronger emotional responses toward the facts→threat→hope message instead. Regression results revealed that vaccine perceptions, risk-taking tendencies, HPV susceptibility, and emotional response significantly predicted vaccination intention, in that order. TV advertising was identified as the leading HPV information source, followed by social media advertisements and recommendations from health professionals. Conclusions: These findings highlight that incorporating emotional flow may enhance message engagement among unvaccinated individuals. HPV campaigns should consider increasing positive vaccine perceptions, alleviating perceived threat of HPV, and eliciting positive emotional response toward vaccination acceptance and adoption.",

    "Abstract": "Immune-mediated non-neoplastic bone marrow disorders (NNBMD), including precursor-targeted immune-mediated anemia (PIMA) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), can cause non-regenerative anemia in dogs and often fail to respond to immunosuppressive treatment. Human intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) has been proposed as an immunomodulatory therapy for refractory hematologic disease in humans, but evidence in veterinary patients remains limited. This case report describes the adjunctive use of hIVIG and the associated clinical responses observed in two dogs with refractory NNBMD. A 10-year-old (3.2 kg) spayed female Maltese (case 1) showed persistent non-regenerative anemia, with hematocrit (HCT) 15.6–20.2% and reticulocyte production index (RPI) 0.12–0.69, requiring four transfusions over 10 months, and was diagnosed with PIMA based on bone marrow cytology demonstrating destruction of erythroid precursors. A 7-year-old (9.3 kg) intact female Dachshund (case 2) had sustained non-regenerative anemia (HCT 10.8–20.9%, RPI 0.12–0.40) necessitating eight transfusions over 20 months and was diagnosed with MDS characterized by dyserythropoiesis. Human intravenous immunoglobulin (0.5 g/kg over 6 h) was administered six times in case 1 and seven times in case 2 over a four-month period. After initiating hIVIG therapy, RPI increased (0→1.80 and 0.25→2.10 in cases 1 and 2), and HCT remained above 20% without further transfusions. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical report demonstrating the adjunctive use of hIVIG and associated hematologic improvement in canine NNBMD.",

    "Abstract": "Existing research in extended reality for education emphasizes learning outcomes rather than the process for developing their materials. Design thinking, a method in Research through Design, which often generates artefacts and systems, can help address this limitation. As such, this paper presents a process for developing 360° videos based on the six steps of the design thinking process with a new step for planning. The authors also propose a novel approach emphasizing co-creation and Indigenous Research Values throughout the process, showing respect, and minimizing misinterpretations, appropriations, and weak translations that often result from recording stories. Presented through an example titled ‘Tipi Teachings’, a digital story rooted in Indigenous Knowledge of Engineering, the authors demonstrate how design thinking and co-creation can be applied to digital storytelling, proposing a procedure which aims to provide guidance to future researchers utilizing digital storytelling, minimizing trial and error, and providing an opportunity for researchers to share and document lessons learned. While the proposed process was created within a Canadian Indigenous research context, and centers Indigenous storybasket values, these values require researchers to listen to and build relationships with the community, incorporating their core values, regardless of whether they directly align with the storybasket values, adjusting the process to their specific context. The decolonial design process aligned with design thinking also considers decolonization globally, rather than locally.",

    "Abstract": "With the increasing application of box culvert-type two-way channel pumping systems in low-head pumping stations along rivers in China, a comprehensive investigation of their hydraulic performance is of significant importance. In this study, a physical model test was conducted on a box culvert-type two-way channel pumping station located along the Yangtze River. The energy performance, cavitation characteristics, runaway characteristics, and pressure pulsation behavior of the pumping system were systematically examined. The experimental results indicate that the pumping system achieves optimal energy performance when the blade installation angle is −2°, under which the maximum system efficiency reaches 68.0% while satisfying the operational requirements across different head conditions. For a given blade angle, the critical cavitation margin of the pumping system initially decreases and subsequently increases as the head decreases. At the same head, the critical cavitation margin increases with increasing blade installation angle. Furthermore, the unit runaway speed of the pumping system increases as the blade angle decreases. The blade installation angle significantly influences the amplitude of pressure pulsations at the impeller, whereas its effect on the dominant frequency is relatively minor. The overall pressure pulsation amplitudes measured at the impeller are less than 0.20 m. These findings provide valuable experimental insights for the hydraulic optimization design and operational regulation of similar pumping stations, contributing to improved operational efficiency and reliability while reducing operating costs.",

    "Abstract": "Green roofs in Southern Europe are interest-growing nature-based solutions, capable of improving urban sustainability by positively impacting the water cycle, biodiversity, pollution, and, in some cases, energy consumption and carbon sequestration. Native plants adapted to Mediterranean climates exhibit drought-resistant traits, making them highly suitable for the challenging microclimate of green roofs. This microclimate features intense solar radiation, strong winds, and higher temperatures, in comparison to ground level, leading to increased atmospheric evaporative demand, driven by the interplay of radiation, wind, temperature, and humidity. Consequently, native plants from ecosystems resembling this microclimate are likely better suited for green roofs than local ground-level species. The current review synthesizes current knowledge on the use of native plants in Southern European green roofs, focusing on water management challenges given the region’s climate and scarce water resources. Out of roughly 12,500 native plant species in the Mediterranean basin, only about 124 have been examined in the past 20 years for green roof applications, with just 16% appearing in multiple scientific studies, highlighting a significant knowledge gap. The data indicate that ca. 85% of these species are perennials, valued for their low maintenance needs, a key consideration for green roof sustainability. Some of the studied species retain adequate aesthetic value when cultivated on green roofs with limited water availability. These species are mainly associated with four habitat types—rocky, coastal, dry, or well-drained environments—with a few linked to humid or adaptable conditions. This study aims to document the selection of drought-adapted native plant species best suited for green roof implementation in Southern Europe, contributing to enhancing sustainable urban design in the region, considering water management best practices and water use efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Background In the Danish healthcare system, primary care for the growing population of older adults is provided by around 1600 independently owned general practices with a high degree of autonomy in service delivery. Aim to investigate practice-level variation in consultation frequencies for older adults in Denmark and its association with practice-level factors, after adjustment for patient characteristics. Design &amp; setting Register-based nationwide cohort study of all Danish residents aged≥75 years listed with a general practice in 2017-2021. Method The practices’ consultation frequencies were analysed using zero-inflated Poisson regression adjusted for patient population factors. Funnel plots assessed variation in consultations. Multinomial logistic regression was used for analysing associations between practice factors and exhibiting systematic variation in consultation frequency. Results In 2017, the study included 468 679 older adults, rising to 569 457 in 2021. In 2021, the average consultation frequency was 10, comprising 3.7 face-to-face, 3.3 telephone, 2.2 e-mail, 0.61 home visit, and 0.38 chronic care review consultations. After adjusting for the practices’ patient population, 4% to 9% of general practices showed greater variation in consultation frequency than could be explained by chance. No practice-level factors: number of general practitioners, their age, sex, or years since specialist qualification, were associated with providing more consultations than expected. Conclusion The systematic variation in consultation frequencies between practices is notable. Further studies should explore the potential consequences for patients registered with a general practice exhibiting consultation frequencies that differ significantly from other practices beyond what could be explained by chance.",

    "Abstract": "Desde a experiencia vivida no movemento cooperativista catalán, o autor presenta as avantaxes da intercooperación, tanto da orientada a acadar obxectivos de tipo social, ideolóxico ou político como da orientada á mellora empresarial e económica das cooperativas. A intercooperación con obxectivos de mellora empresarial permite resolver a contradicción entre a necesidade de medranza empresarial imposta pola globalización e o aumento da competitividade no mercado, e a eficiencia dos pequenos grupos organizativos onde se acada unha maior participación e implicación dos traballadores e traballadoras. Se a estratexia de subcontratación é a propia das empresas capitalistas convencionais para superar esta contradicción, as cooperativas deberán intercooperaren pararesolver este mesmo problema situándose en puntos de alto valor engadido. No mesmo nivel empresarial, a intercooperación dá acceso a unha maior información e anticipación ante as situacións de mercado, e por conseguinte a unha maior capacidade de adaptación. O autor sinala tamén as principais dificultades nos procesos de intercooperación: problemas inherentes ó liderato, disciplina do grupo e “medo a velocidade”. A intercooperación con obxectivos sociais e políticos estímase como estratexia fundamental para a defensa dos dereitos das cooperativas e a proxección da fórmula e os valores cooperativos cara ó exterior.",

    "Abstract": "This article proposes polyphonic bricolage, a concept introduced by Schmidt (2006), that embraces the dynamic blending of diverse cultural influences as a tool for addressing the psychosocial needs of Afro-Caribbean clients in art therapy. Eurocentric art therapy models often fail to account for the cultural complexities of these communities, resulting in marginalisation and inequitable practices. Polyphonic bricolage offers a lens for understanding the shifting cultural identities of Afro-Caribbean clients, emphasising their fluidity, agency, and identity formation. When integrated with cultural humility, it highlights the art therapist’s role in fostering therapeutic alliances and ensuring equitable practice. By cultivating self-reflexivity and flexibility, art therapists can recognise biases and create spaces that honour clients’ lived experiences. This integrated framework encourages culturally responsive interventions that build trust, empower clients, and lead to meaningful therapeutic outcomes. A brief supervision vignette demonstrates how a lack of cultural understanding can cause harm and illustrates the importance of culturally attuned practice. Ultimately, combining polyphonic bricolage with cultural humility provides a pathway for art therapists to engage Afro-Caribbean communities in a more responsive, fair, and empowering way.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer is a leading global health concern, affecting not only physical health but also psychological, social, emotional and spiritual well-being. Music listening has been explored as a supportive, non-pharmacological intervention within oncology care. The objective of this systematic literature review was to examine the role of music listening in cancer care, focusing on (1) the types of music listening interventions used and (2) the roles and outcomes of such interventions for individuals with cancer. The methods used were a systematic literature review. Literature was systematically searched across Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale (RILM), ScienceDirect, Music Periodicals Database, PsycINFO, Sage Journals, Google Scholar, and PubMed (2000–2024). Inclusion criteria: published literature, peer-reviewed studies involving individuals with cancer and interventions centred on music listening (e.g., pre-recorded, live, guided imagery, and music). Exclusion criteria: non-English, pre-2000, systematic reviews, unpublished literature, meta-analyses, and studies not isolating music listening. Thirteen studies met the criteria. Data were extracted and analysed thematically. Guided imagery and music (GIM), pre-recorded music (e.g., CD/MP3), live music listening, receptive music therapy, music-and-imagery, and group listening session interventions were conducted that ranged from 12 minutes to two hours, most commonly 30 minutes. Intervention outcomes clustered into five themes: (1) symptom reduction (pain, anxiety, depression, nausea), (2) benefits of music listening as a non-pharmacological intervention, (3) coping and enhancement of quality of life, (4) cognitive benefits (memory, distraction from intrusive thoughts, and (5) connectedness (intrapersonal, interpersonal, transpersonal). The conclusions drawn from the results are that music listening is a safe, feasible, cost-effective, and non-invasive adjunct to oncology care. Despite promising results, limitations such as small sample sizes and heterogeneity of study design restrict generalisability. Future research should utilise larger, more rigorous trials, explore digital/streaming music interventions, and evaluate long-term effects.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: Although polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) is more hydrophobic than polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) in fluorocarbon polymer (FCP) membrane filters, it has been reported that the rate of amyloid fibril formation is faster on PVDF than on PTFE. To clarify whether the effect is due to the membrane’s chemical structure or its hydrophobicity at the membrane interface, studies on amyloid fibril formation were conducted using both hydrophobic and hydrophilic PVDF and PTFE membranes. Methods: Heat-treated insulin (INS) was adsorbed onto the FCP membrane filters. Gaussian integrals were employed to determine the amounts of β-sheet and their abundance ratios by curve fitting of attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectra. Results: Adsorbed heat-treated INS onto the FCP membrane filters showed a β-sheet form, with a similar or higher affinity in comparison with that of the β-rich concanavalin A. The adsorption followed a sigmoidal curve with a 2-hour lag time, reaching a plateau after 4–5 hours. The spectral patterns of the adsorbed INS indicated the β-sheet form, demonstrating that INS transformed into β-sheet and then, or simultaneously, adsorbed onto the FCP membrane filters. Conclusions: The results regarding the rate and strength of amyloid fibril formation for each FCP membrane filter suggest that, beyond the membrane’s surface hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity, other factors, such as the electron affinity of hydrogen in the PVDF membrane, also influence nucleation. This study provides insight into the role of INS in amyloid fibril formation within FCP membrane filters.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Irreversible pulpitis is commonly associated with reduced success of inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) during root canal treatment, often leading to inadequate intraoperative pain control. Inflammatory mediators can decrease local anesthetic effectiveness and alter nerve response. Preoperative administration of anti-inflammatory drugs has been proposed as a strategy to improve anesthetic success. This review evaluates whether preoperative anti-inflammatory medication enhances the efficacy of IANB in patients with irreversible pulpitis. Methods: Thirteen articles published between 2014 and 2024 were included in the qualitative analysis following a screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts. The quality of the studies was assessed using the ROBINS tool. Results: Premedication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids significantly improves the success of IANB in patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis. Success rates in treated groups generally range between 55% and 73%, compared to less than 40% in control groups. Ibuprofen, ketorolac, and dexamethasone were among the most effective agents. Discussion: Premedication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, especially ibuprofen and dexamethasone, improves the efficacy of IANB in symptomatic irreversible pulpitis, enhancing anesthetic success and reducing intraoperative pain.",

    "Abstract": "This exploratory sequential study explored teacher perspectives about building relatedness in their School-Based Agricultural Education (SBAE) program by utilizing semi-structured interviews, and the data were used to build an instrument to further examine the use of relatedness. In the qualitative phase, we utilized a basic qualitative design and purposively sampled (n = 8) Ohio teachers. We found that teachers shared four relatedness themes in their SBAE program: attainable relationships, student commitment, accessible mentorship, and student collaboration. In the quantitative phase, a stratified probabilistic sampling of our target audience (n = 320), which was the National Association of Agricultural Educators (NAAE) Region IV teachers. The quantitative results demonstrated that teachers perceived that it was somewhat true that each of the relatedness themes were present in their programs. Additionally, it was found that demographic data had no relationship to the presence of the relatedness themes. From these findings, it is recommended that SBAE teachers use pedagogical and programmatic strategies that allow the four themes of attainable relationships, student commitment, accessible mentorship, and student collaboration to flourish within their SBAE program.",

    "Abstract": "Since its discovery almost 100 years ago, growth hormone (GH) has been extensively studied to elucidate its structural characteristics, receptor interactions and its physiologic and non-physiologic effects. These actions include but are not limited to its effects on somatic growth, substrate metabolism, body composition, bone mineral density, cardiovascular system, and cognitive function. Contextually, recombinant human GH was approved for growth promotion in children and to enhance metabolic health in adult patients with GH deficiency (GHD), along with other clinical indications. Studies involving individuals and animal models exhibiting dysregulated GH levels, ranging from complete or partial GHD to GH excess, have unveiled a spectrum of several less evident GH actions. In this review, we exclude discussing the classic GH therapeutic applications but instead focus on the interplay between GH and glucose metabolism, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis that is observed with varying GH levels and action. We also discuss clinical data derived from studies in acromegaly and GHD patients (including individuals with congenital GH and insulin-like growth factor I [IGF-I] deficiencies), and attempt to integrate findings from cellular, animal and human studies with the aim of highlighting novel characteristics and underlying molecular pathways through which both GH and IGF-I exert their more subtle actions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Recent analyses conclude that Betelgeuse, a red supergiant star (HD 39801), likely has a companion object with a period of ∼2000 days orbiting at only 2.3 R ⋆ , deep in the chromosphere of the supergiant. A probable detection of such a companion, named Siwarha, has just occurred from speckle imaging. This study finds that Betelgeuse spectra in the optical region and ultraviolet exhibit signatures of variable circumstellar absorption and chromospheric outflows. These variations are consistent with the ∼2000 days period of the companion object. Circumstellar absorption evident in optical Mn I lines, and mass outflow marked by ultraviolet Fe II , Si I , and Mg I lines increase after the transit of the companion across the disk of Betelgeuse. Following the eclipse of the companion, the absorption and outflow slowly decrease in advance of the next transit. The occurrence and variation of this plasma appear consistent with the presence of a trailing and expanding wake caused by a companion star orbiting within the atmosphere of Betelgeuse.",

    "Abstract": "In Europe, the beetle tribe Leptodirini (Coleoptera, Leiodidae) reaches its highest diversity in southern parts of the continent, where this predominantly subterranean group developed into one of the largest subterranean radiations in the World. Within this belt, encompassing Iberian Peninsula, Italian Preapls and Balkan Peninsula, the highest species diversity is reached in the North-western Balkan’s Dinaric Karst. Ever since the scientific description of the first subterranean beetle species, Leptodirus hochenwartii Schmidt, 1832 in the North-western Dinarides, numerous discoveries and publications accumulated up to present. These records have been systematically gathered in the Slovenian SubBioLab’s database SubBioDB; however, they were previously not publicly available. Herein, we present the dataset on Western Balkan’s Leptodirini and provide some of its basic characteristics. We present the first comprehensive dataset of published records of the tribe Leptodirini in the North-western Balkans, covering primarily the Dinaric Karst and adjacent areas of the Southern Calcareous Alps and the Albanides. The dataset includes 5,535 records compiled from 333 literature sources representing 334 species with 176 subspecies. All records were georeferenced with the highest possible spatial precision. Using published data, we provide checklists of species and subspecies for included countries, a consolidated bibliography of all publications containing Leptodirini records, spatial maps highlighting the areas of highest taxa richness and an overview of the number of records, sites and range sizes for each species and subspecies across the study area. This dataset provides a foundation for future research and sampling campaigns in the region, as well as a spatially-explicit resource for investigating the diversity and distribution of Leptodirini in Europe’s largest karst area.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for over 90% of oral malignancies and is often associated with poor outcomes when diagnosed at advanced stages. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and Ki-67 proliferation index are increasingly recognized as important prognostic biomarkers. This study aimed to evaluate EGFR and Ki-67 expression in OSCC and analyze their correlation with TIL density and histopathological parameters. Materials and Methods: An observational study was conducted on 50 histologically confirmed OSCC cases over 1 year. Clinical details, tumor site, grade, stage, and TIL levels were documented. Immunohistochemistry for EGFR and Ki-67 was performed using rabbit monoclonal antibodies. Associations between TILs, EGFR, Ki-67, and clinicopathological variables were analyzed statistically. Results: The mean age of patients was 46.1 ± 9.8 years, with buccal mucosa being the most frequent site (66%). Most of the tumors were well-differentiated (82%). Pathological staging revealed pT3 in 36% and pN0 in 68% of cases. High EGFR expression was noted in 78% of tumors, while 70% showed Ki-67 &gt;10%. Stromal TILs were high in 48% and moderate in 46%, whereas intra-tumoral TILs were predominantly low (76%). A statistically significant association was found between stromal TIL levels, Ki-67 expression, and EGFR positivity ( P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Stromal TIL density correlates significantly with EGFR and Ki-67 expression in OSCC, suggesting that combined assessment of these biomarkers may provide valuable prognostic insight. Their integration into routine histopathological evaluation could improve risk stratification and guide personalized therapeutic approaches.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is classified as a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and it is commonly used to reduce fever, alleviate pain, and has anti-inflammatory properties. Pregnant women often use aspirin, especially in the first trimester of pregnancy, as it is easily available over-the-counter. It is prescribed for long-term use during pregnancy in certain chronic conditions and to manage obstetrical complications like preterm labor and polyhydramnios. As there is limited literature about the teratogenic effects of aspirin, the present study has been undertaken. Methods: Pregnant Swiss albino mice were separated into two groups, comprising 88 mice each: a control and a treated. The treated group was administered aspirin at a dose of 100 mg/kg body weight via the oral route from the 3 rd to the 5 th day of gestation, while the control group received an equivalent volume of tap water orally. On the 19 th day of gestation, the mice from each group were sacrificed. The collected fetuses were carefully examined and photographed to document any visible abnormalities. After being fixed in a 10% neutral formalin solution, the brain of the fetuses were extracted, photographed, and then further processed for histological examination. Results: Gross examination reveals no malformations in control group fetuses, while 40.3% of treated group fetuses show hemorrhagic spots, 20.7% have forelimb deformities, and other defects are noted, including reduced crown-rump length and venous congestion. Microscopic examination of the cerebral cortex in treated fetuses shows significant neurotoxic changes, including edema, cell degeneration, and prominent cellular debris. Conclusions: While aspirin is commonly utilized, it poses potential risks of toxicity and teratogenic effects. Therefore, clinicians should thoroughly justify its use in women during the early stages of pregnancy.",

    "Abstract": "Modern Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) employ undocumented linear address-scrambling functions to obfuscate DRAM addressing, which complicates DRAM-aware performance optimizations and hinders proactive security analysis of DRAM-based attacks; most notably, Rowhammer. Although previous work tackled the issue of reversing physical-to-DRAM mapping, existing heuristic-based reverse-engineering approaches are partial, costly, and impractical for comprehensive recovery. This paper establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation and provides efficient practical algorithms for black-box, complete physical-to-DRAM address-mapping recovery. We first formulate the reverse-engineering problem within a linear algebraic model over the finite field GF(2). We characterize the timing fingerprints of row-buffer conflicts, proving a relationship between a bank addressing matrix and an empirically constructed matrix of physical addresses. Based on this characterization, we develop an efficient, noise-robust, and fully platform-agnostic algorithm to recover the full bank-mask basis in polynomial time, a significant improvement over the exponential search from previous works. We further generalize our model to complex row mappings, introducing new hardware-based hypotheses that enable the automatic recovery of a row basis instead of previous human-guided contributions. Evaluations across embedded and server-class architectures confirm our method's effectiveness, successfully reconstructing known mappings and uncovering previously unknown scrambling functions. Our method provides a 99% recall and accuracy on all tested platforms. Most notably, Knoc-Knock runs in under a few minutes, even on systems with more than 500GB of DRAM, showcasing the scalability of our method. Our approach provides an automated, principled pathway to accurate DRAM reverse engineering.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. The structure of the tropical upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) affects radiative balance, stability, and regional dynamics in important ways. Lack of reliable observational baselines poses a challenge to evaluating model representation of UTLS properties. Here, we use in-situ data, primarily from the StratoClim field campaign over the Asian Monsoon area, to assess the UTLS temperature, moisture, and ice clouds in the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model at storm-resolving grid spacing. We also employ superpressure balloon data and updrafts of the POSIDON and ATTREX campaigns to evaluate the UTLS convective updrafts and gravity wave activity in ICON. Our simulations show the upper troposphere is too cold, while the lower stratosphere is too warm and excessively dry relative to observations. These thermodynamic biases coincide with overestimated cloud ice in the upper troposphere and underestimated cloud ice in the lower stratosphere. The mean convective updraft is underestimated by 80 % in the model, and the power spectral density for temperature fluctuations of frequencies greater than 10−3 s−1 is underestimated by orders of magnitude. Too weak dynamics exacerbate a lack of ice cloud above 100 hPa. Too weak and too infrequent convective overshoots or too rapid dissipation of upper-tropospheric ice clouds in the model are two possible explanatory mechanisms for these biases.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Organic nitrogen (ON) is an important yet poorly constrained component of aerosol total nitrogen (TN), particularly over remote oceans. We quantified aerosol ON in 92 total suspended particulate samples collected across approximately 160° of latitude in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) during Chinese Antarctic and Arctic expeditions (2019–2024), using a newly developed method that simultaneously determines ON and inorganic nitrogen. A significant latitudinal gradient was observed, with significantly higher ON concentrations (expressed as N) in the Northern Hemisphere (83.3 ± 141.4 ng m−3) than in the Southern Hemisphere (15.4 ± 12.4 ng m−3). Regionally, coastal East Asia recorded the highest ON levels (164.6 ± 179.1 ng m−3) but a lower ON/TN ratio (21.1 ± 7.9 %), indicating strong terrestrial and anthropogenic influence. In contrast, the Arctic Ocean had lower ON concentrations (19.1 ± 19.0 ng m−3) but the highest ON/TN ratio (38.6 ± 12.4 %), suggesting dominant marine biogenic sources. The Southern Ocean showed the lowest ON concentration (12.0 ± 7.1 ng m−3) yet a relatively high ON/TN ratio (27.8 ± 11.0 %), also pointing to oceanic origins. Near Antarctica, samples influenced by sea-ice air masses displayed markedly elevated ON and ON/TN ratios. These increases were strongly correlated with sea ice concentration and chlorophyll a exposure, indicating enhanced biogenic emissions from sea-ice-associated ecosystems. This study offers the first direct ON measurements along a global MABL transect, revealing distinct latitudinal and regional patterns, and emphasizing the combined roles of continental inputs and marine sources. It also identifies sea-ice dynamics as a key factor influencing ON in Antarctic regions, providing crucial data for improving atmospheric and climate models.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Farmers across the world frequently use fire during the winter or dry season, to remove accumulated dead pasture biomass. These fire-management practices have profound effects on vegetation, soil nutrients, and biogeochemical cycles, yet they are rarely represented in process-based fire models embedded within Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs). We couple the Chalumeau algorithm, which estimates expected burning dates, with the SPITFIRE module in the DGVM LPJmL and enable the modelling of fire as a grassland management method. Using this model development, we examine the short- and long-term impacts of varying burning strategies, frequencies, and livestock densities across distinct regions, using Brazil as a case study. Our results show that integrating grazing and fire management leads to a gradual decline in vegetation carbon, accompanied by a substantial reduction of the ecosystem and soil nitrogen. This study emphasises the importance of incorporating such practices into DGVMs to enhance the accuracy of impact assessments for pasture management. Furthermore, our findings call for improved data collection describing fire usage methods by farmers, as well as long-term measurements, particularly on vegetation, soil carbon and nitrogen development under burning practices.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Agroforestry systems are considered suitable nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change. Long-term measurements of CO2 flux densities, evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux densities are, however, largely still missing. Here we present a unique eddy covariance and meteorological dataset from a total of ten stations paired over agroforestry and open cropland or grassland agricultural sites located in Northern Germany. The data were harmonized to create a consistent dataset which includes gap-filled time series of meteorological and lower-cost eddy covariance measurements with identical instrumentation, accounting for a total of seventy eight site-years of data. The objective of this dataset is to provide observational data on the differences of meteorological conditions, carbon, water and energy balances of adjacent agroforestry and open cropland or grassland sites in five distinct regions of Germany. This extensive, continuous dataset can be used to study ecosystem properties and the potential benefits of agroforestry. It can also be used to parametrize models on crop and biomass productivity, or to evaluate the response of such agroecosystems to climate change scenarios, among other applications. Anticipated key users of this dataset are researchers in the fields of micrometeorology, eddy covariance, agronomy, and ecosystem modeling.

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Global climate models offer the most comprehensive description of the climate system and its internal processes to date but current computational capabilities typically restrict their spatial resolution to the order of hundreds of kilometers when long-term (millennial or longer) simulations are needed. Over the years, various downscaling techniques have been developed to generate fine scale data from climate models outputs but they often exhibit important limitations when applied over long periods of time. Building on previous efforts, we present a simple topography-based model (GeoDS) to downscale precipitation fields in complex areas, adapted to paleoclimate studies involving multi-millennia simulations. With a limited amount of inputs from a climate model and high resolved geographical information, the model computes, for each time step and every grid point, a topographic exposure index used to distribute precipitation into a high-resolution spatial grid. This dimensionless quantity represents the exposure of surfaces to dominant windward incoming airflows, assumed to bring most of the humidity, and only depends on large scale winds and terrain configuration. The model is first tested under current climate conditions over part of the European Alpine region due to the availability of field data for comparison; the complexity of both regional topography and climate conditions making it a good test of the proposed methodology. The relative effects of the model's parameters are assessed as well as the capacity of GeoDS to reproduce the spatial precipitation distribution of a well-resolved gridded target dataset. Despite uncertainties regarding the correct wind fields to choose as input, and the dependency of the model to the temporal resolution of the large-scale data to downscale, we show that the procedure is able to capture most of the patterns occurring at fine spatial scale while being computationally inexpensive. We also demonstrate that the physical base underlying our work grants the model valuable robustness when used outside the calibration framework. This notably opens promising prospects for the application of GeoDS in paleoclimate contexts while providing a flexible, open source and well documented downscaling tool for the climate community.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Large-eddy simulations (LES) are essential tools for studies on atmospheric turbulence and clouds and play critical roles in the development of turbulence and convection parameterizations. Current numerical weather models have approached kilometer-scale resolution as supercomputing facilities advance. However, this resolution range is in the so-called gray zone, where subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence actively interacts with resolved motion and significantly influences the large-scale characteristics of simulated weather systems. Thus, a novel LES framework is required to enable the development of new SGS approaches for the gray zone. Here we used the Python library JAX to develop a new LES model. It is based on the generalized pseudo-incompressible equations formulated by Durran (2008). For a classic warm bubble case, the traditional Smagorinsky model fails to reproduce the correct structure evolution of the warm bubble, though it can modestly correct the rising speed in gray-zone resolution simulations. Utilizing the capability of JAX for automatic differentiation, we trained a deep learning-based SGS turbulence model for the same case. The trained deep learning SGS model, based on a simple autoencoder (AE), enables this physics-deep learning hybrid model to accurately simulate the expansion of the thermal bubble and the development of rotors surrounding the center of the bubble at a gray-zone resolution. The gray-zone simulation results are comparable to those of the benchmark LES resolution.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Arctic sea ice extent has declined significantly over the past four decades, opening up the Arctic to shipping and resource extraction while also impacting wildlife and local communities. This has led to an increasing need for skillful sea ice predictions. We focus on furthering the understanding of the role that sea ice thickness plays in the skilfulness of seasonal Arctic sea ice predictions. We look at how observations of sea ice thickness can improve both sea ice reanalyses and predictions. We use the Norwegian Climate Prediction Model (NorCPM) with 1° horizontal resolution for the ocean and sea ice components and approximately 2° for the atmosphere and land components, which has previously assimilated ocean and sea ice concentration observations. We additionally assimilate two sea ice thickness products: CS2SMOS, and, for the first time in any study, ENVISAT. This allows us to produce a two-decade (2003–2023) reanalysis with sea ice thickness assimilation focusing on the Arctic Ocean. This reanalysis is then used to initialise and generate a series of year-long seasonal hindcasts for each season of the reanalysis. The reanalysis and hindcasts are compared to observations and other reanalyses to assess the impact of sea ice thickness observations. Assimilation of sea ice thickness data strongly improves the representation of sea ice thickness and volume, primarily in the central Arctic as well as the ice edge location. Although ENVISAT observations have greater uncertainties, the dataset still provides a useful impact on the model. For prediction, sea ice thickness initialisation reduces the model biases of thickness throughout the year as well as errors in the detrended anomalies. Ice thickness bias correction results in improvements in the representation of the ice edge location, i.e., the timing and extent of the summer melting. Thickness initialisation has little improvements for detrended sea ice extent anomalies, but yields some skill in the Beaufort Sea and Central Arctic during summer. Overall, we show the impact of sea ice thickness assimilation has a positive effect on prediction skill in NorCPM.",

    "Abstract": "Antimicrobial peptide (AMP) coatings show potential in preventing implant-associated infections (IAI), but their effectiveness is frequently limited by enzymatic degradation and cytotoxicity at elevated densities. This study demonstrates that complete D-amino acid substitution of surface-grafted AMPs effectively addresses these shortcomings. Using a model antimicrobial peptide (DRAMP04195) covalently immobilized on titanium via strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC), we compared the L- and D-peptide variants. At a high grafting density, Ti-D-80 achieves near-complete eradication of both S. aureus and E. coli (&gt;99.99%), outperforming Ti-L-80. Scanning electron microscopy confirms membrane disruption as the primary antibacterial mechanism for both surfaces. Importantly, Ti-D-80 retains over 90% of its antibacterial activity after protease treatment, whereas Ti-L-80 is almost completely inactivated. Moreover, Ti-D-80 exhibits excellent biocompatibility, supporting cell adhesion and proliferation comparable to that of pristine titanium, in contrast to the cytotoxicity observed with Ti-L-80. These findings establish D-amino acid substitution as an effective strategy to simultaneously enhance enzymatic stability, antibacterial potency, and biocompatibility of AMP-functionalized implants, providing a robust approach for designing durable and tissue-compatible antimicrobial interfaces.",

Although synthetic and plant-based therapies are used to treat a variety of liver illnesses, treatments for HCC are frequently associated with considerable adverse effects as well as drug resistance. Plant-derived natural bioactive compounds, which are known for their low toxicity and protective properties, offer a possibly safer choice for HCC treatment. This study focuses on the most potent plant bioactive compounds for developing new therapeutic alternatives against Hepatocellular carcinoma. A primary phytochemical evaluation was carried out on Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp., exploring both qualitative and quantitative assays and an analysis of its antioxidant properties using DPPH. Metabolites profiling using LC-MS analysis identified 88 phytochemicals from the methanolic extract of the selected plant as bioactive compounds. The HCC molecular target, such as CTNNB1, was identified through the network analysis and BRAF, FGFR and EGFR, were selected based literature study, and their 3D structures were retrieved from the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB, https://www.rcsb.org/ (accessed on 12 November 2025). Ligand structures were retrieved from the NCBI PubChem database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ (accessed on 12 November 2025) and converted into 3D sdf. format for molecular docking analysis. Molegro Virtual Docker (MVD) 6.0 to evaluate the Molecular docking studies considering the interaction between the selected ligands and HCC targets, and compare with positive controls. Among the compounds evaluated, Cis-Mulberroside A, Asperuloside tetraacetate, Rutin, Biorobin and Cassiaside C showed better binding efficiency with the selected targets compared with the positive controls of respective targets. Among these, Cis-Mulberroside A (also referred to as Mulberroside D), a stilbenoid glycoside, exhibited the highest binding affinity for CTNNB1, BRAF, FGFR and EGFR, outperforming the reference compounds. These results suggest that Mulberroside D holds significant inhibitory potential against critical targets in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), particularly CTNNB1, BRAF, FGFR and EGFR, which are crucial in the signaling pathways of HCC progression. Based on the phytochemical analysis along with metabolite profiling, Cis-Mulberroside A, stands most prominent bioactive constituent. The molecular docking scores and hydrogen bonding analysis of the selected targets compared to the respective positive control, Cis-Mulberroside A, revealed as a promising compound and could be a potential bioactive phytoconstituent for a valuable drug lead for future use in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).",

    "Abstract": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) represents a critical yet often underdiagnosed contributor to occupational morbidity, given its established links to impaired vigilance, neurocognitive dysfunction, and accident proneness. This cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of OSA risk and its relationship with occupational accidents among rotating shift workers. Between April and June 2024, 217 textile workers underwent assessment using the STOP-BANG questionnaire (score ≥3 indicating OSA risk) alongside the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Insomnia Severity Index. Compared with their counterparts, those at risk were older, had higher body mass index, larger neck and waist circumferences, longer employment duration, more comorbidities, and higher daytime sleepiness scores (ESS: 4 [0–11] vs. 5 [0–16]; p = 0.007), while subjective sleep time and sleep quality indices were comparable. In total, 36.4% of workers reported an occupational accident in the past year. Accident prevalence was higher in those with OSA risk (50.0% vs. 28.1%), and OSA risk remained an independent predictor of accidents (adjusted OR = 2.55; 95% CI: 1.44–4.53; p = 0.001) in the fully adjusted model. These findings highlight OSA as a prevalent, underrecognized determinant of occupational safety among shift workers. Integrating systematic OSA screening into workplace health surveillance and implementing targeted preventive measures could mitigate accident risk, improve productivity, and contribute to a closer alignment between sleep medicine and occupational health practice.",

    "Abstract": "The increasing number of satellites and space debris reentering Earth's atmosphere poses significant challenges to aviation safety, particularly due to the unpredictability of uncontrolled reentries. With the rapid growth of satellite constellations, these events are expected to increase, and despite advancements in tracking systems and controlled reentry technologies, many reentries remain difficult to predict. While real-time monitoring tools such as the U.S. Space Data Integrator (SDI) and Europe's SpaceTrack offer critical support for Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs) to manage debris events, a gap persists in addressing the hazards posed by uncontrolled reentries. The main challenge lies in the timing and precision of reentry predictions. Current hazard areas are often too large to manage effectively. The size of the hazard area combined with the uncertainty of location can lead to unnecessary airspace closures and widespread disruption of global air traffic, which in turn compromises aviation safety. A notable example is the November 2022 uncontrolled reentry of a Chinese Long March 5B rocket stage, which resulted in airspace closures across Europe, even though the debris ultimately landed in the Indian Ocean. Accurate reentry trajectories and hazard zones can typically only be pinpointed minutes before the event, leaving limited time for authorities to respond. Real-time data provision during the final moments of reentry is critical for improving the accuracy of hazard area predictions, enabling timely updates to affected airspace regions. This can ensure aviation safety without unnecessarily closing or evacuating large areas of airspace. By integrating real-time hazard information, advanced reentry prediction tools, and robust communication methods, the aviation sector can mitigate risks while minimizing operational disruptions. The presentation will demonstrate the essential mechanisms and services through which real-time data provision can support and maintain aviation safety, considering the global and cross-border nature of debris mitigation efforts. It will also address the need for interoperable, internationally harmonized procedures to manage uncontrolled reentries effectively.",

    "Abstract": "Information security is crucial with the increasing data and internet usage. In data communication, Imaging data is one of the most frequently used data types for communication, especially in intelligence operations and in law enforcement use cases. Steganography is a method for hiding secrets in cover images, followed by complex image encryption and decryption methods. Previously, many Deep Learning (DL) methods have been proposed on steganography and achieved competitive results. However, there is still a need for lightweight, computationally less expensive DL models. Therefore, a computationally inexpensive, lightweight dual-branch based Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) model is proposed, namely SE-Attn StegaVAE. In this model, the Squeeze and Excitation (SE) block, Attention, and skipping connections are effectively used, whereas a sequentially optimal way is adapted to hide the secret in attention-oriented cover samples. Furthermore, a multi-objective loss function is proposed to penalize the model to hide secrets effectively and reconstruct them without any loss of information. In this study, three experiments have been performed with three different bit embeddings (2, 4, and 8) on the DIV2K dataset utilizing the SE-Attn StegaVAE model. Two-fold validation-based testing results outperformed as compared to State-of-the-Art (SOTA) methods and proven to be more error-free, computationally less expensive, with competitive similarity scores.",

    "Abstract": "The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is crucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, yet it exposes charging infrastructure to sophisticated cyber threats. In the next generation EV charging networks, ultra-low latency, massive device connectivity, and AI-driven automation are key technologies. Traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) struggle with class imbalance, overfitting, and real-time anomaly detection. These limitations threaten user privacy, service continuity, and grid stability. This study proposes a Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) based XGBoost, a hybrid IDS that leverages VAE for feature extraction and handling imbalanced attack data, while XGBoost improves classification accuracy. Evaluated on the CICEVSE2024 dataset, the model surpasses traditional methods like K-Nearest Neighbors and Random Forest, achieving an accuracy of 88.75%, a precision of 88.73%, a recall of 88.75%, and an F1-score of 88.67%. By integrating AI-driven anomaly detection into 6G-enabled smart grids, VAE-XGBoost enhances the cybersecurity resilience of EV charging infrastructure, ensuring scalability, adaptability to novel threats, and real-time mitigation for sustainable and secure transportation networks.",

    "Abstract": "Rice, a global food staple, primary food source for half of the world’s population, is highly vulnerable to abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, heat, and heavy metal toxicity. Silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) have emerged as promising nano-interventions to enhance stress resilience by improving antioxidant defenses, photosynthesis, and ion homeostasis. Recent studies demonstrate that SiNPs modulate the expression of key transporter genes ( OsHMA3, OsLsi1, OsABCC1 ) and activate transcription factors (DREB, NAC, WRKY) that regulate stress tolerance pathways. They also promote the accumulation of compatible solutes and phenolic compounds, reducing oxidative damage and metal toxicity. Omics-based research reveals that SiNPs influence redox signaling, hormonal balance, and epigenetic regulation, providing a clear understanding of their protective mechanisms at the physiological level. These effects are linked to enhanced structural integrity, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and better nutrient uptake. However, rice-specific datasets remain limited, and field-scale validations are still scarce. SiNPs show strong potential as smart nanocarriers for nutrient delivery and gene modulation, integrating effectively with precision and sustainable agriculture practices. However, uncertainties regarding dosage, soil persistence, and food safety require careful evaluation before large-scale use. This review synthesizes physiological, molecular, and omics-based insights into SiNP-mediated abiotic stress tolerance in rice, emphasizing advances in understanding underlying resilience mechanisms. It also highlights environmental and regulatory challenges, identifies critical research gaps, and proposes future directions for safe and scalable applications of SiNPs in rice systems.",

    "Abstract": "Background Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an effective tool for motor function recovery in patients with ischemic stroke (IS). Dysfunction of the glymphatic system is implicated in the pathological process of IS. However, it is still unclear whether the recovery of upper limb motor function in IS is affected by rTMS-driven modulation of glymphatic system function. This study aimed to investigate the potential utility of diffusion tensor imaging analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) in assessing the impact of rTMS on IS recovery. Methods This prospective study recruited IS participants with upper limb motor disorders. A total of 35 participants were randomly assigned to receive either low-frequency rTMS (LF-rTMS) or high-frequency rTMS (HF-rTMS) for two weeks. HF-rTMS was conducted on the infarcted hemisphere M1 and the LF-rTMS was conducted on the non-infarcted hemisphere M1. The information collected from each patient included clinical characteristics, upper limb motor function score, and bilateral hemisphere DTI-ALPS index. Paired t -tests were used to evaluate longitudinal changes of the DTI-ALPS index in LF-rTMS and HF-rTMS groups. The DTI-ALPS index change rates were calculated, and their differences were compared between groups. Spearman’s correlation analyses were performed to assess the relationships between DTI-ALPS index changes and changes in upper limb motor function score. Results At baseline, no significant differences were observed in the DTI-ALPS index between the HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS groups. After two weeks of rTMS treatment, the DTI-ALPS index of the non-stimulated hemisphere in the HF-rTMS group significantly decreased ( t = 2.42, P = 0.028), and the change rate of the DTI-ALPS index was negatively correlated with the recovery of upper limb motor function ( r = − 0.42, P = 0.011). In the LF-rTMS group, longitudinal analysis showed improvement in upper limb motor function scores, but there was no significant change in the DTI-ALPS index. Conclusion Both HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS are beneficial for the rehabilitation of upper limb motor function in patients with IS, but the different changes in DTI-ALPS index may indicate differential effects of HF-rTMS and LF-rTMS on the glymphatic system. However, more research is needed to confirm the underlying mechanisms of this interaction.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study aimed to evaluate the impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on metabolic inflammatory markers in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), providing evidence-based insights for their potential application in anti-inflammatory therapy. Methods Research questions were developed using the PICOS framework, and the study strictly adhered to PRISMA guidelines. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted across PubMed, EBSCO, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. Data synthesis and subgroup analyses (focusing on GLP-1 RA subtypes, treatment duration, and administration frequency) were performed using RevMan 5.4 software. Results Out of 1,347 articles retrieved, 25 studies were ultimately included, comprising a total sample of 1,878 participants (879 in the experimental groups and 999 in the control groups). Quality assessment indicated that most studies exhibited a low risk of bias, with only one study rated as high risk and three studies showing some concerns. Meta-analysis results demonstrated that 18 studies reported a significant reduction in CRP levels in T2DM patients treated with GLP-1 RAs (SMD = −0.39, 95% CI [−0.72 to −0.06], P = 0.02, I 2 = 88%). Although the results from 13 studies indicated a decreasing trend in IL-6 levels (SMD = −0.52), this change was not statistically significant (95% CI [−1.34 to 0.29], P = 0.21, I 2 = 96%). Additionally, 14 studies showed that GLP-1 RAs significantly reduced TNF- α levels (SMD = −0.51, 95% CI [−0.81 to −0.20], P = 0.001, I 2 = 81%). Subgroup analyses revealed that both the type of GLP-1 RA and a longer treatment duration (≥36 weeks) were associated with more pronounced improvements in inflammatory markers. Conclusion GLP-1 RAs exhibit a certain degree of anti-inflammatory effect in patients with T2DM, effectively reducing CRP and TNF- α levels. The anti-inflammatory efficacy appears to be influenced by both the type of drug used and the duration of treatment, with more pronounced effects observed for specific drug classes and with longer treatment periods. These findings provide further evidence supporting the use of GLP-1 RAs in the anti-inflammatory management of T2DM.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study aims to evaluate whether Positron Emission Tomography–Computed Tomography (PET-CT) imaging features of primary tumors and lymph nodes, combined with clinical and pathological data, can accurately predict mediastinal lymph node metastasis (MLNM) in resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using machine learning models. Methods A retrospective study was conducted on 390 NSCLC patients who underwent tumor resection and lymph node dissection between January 2017 and December 2023. All patients received 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET-CT scans within two weeks before surgery. Data from 390 primary tumors and 1,026 lymph node stations were analyzed. Clinical and PET-CT imaging features were extracted, and feature selection was performed using a random forest algorithm. Eight machine learning models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, classification and regression tree (CART), support vector machine (SVM), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), Random Forest, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBoost) and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (KNN). Three models were developed Tumor-Pathology-Clinical (TPC), Lymph-Pathology-Clinical (LPC), and Tumor-Lymph-Pathology-Clinical (TLPC). Model performance was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), and confusion matrices. Results The TLPC model, based on the XGBoost algorithm, showed the best performance, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.90 (95% CI [0.883–0.957]), specificity of 0.84, and sensitivity of 0.96 ( P = 0.0069; significant at P &lt; 0.05). In comparison, the TPC model achieved an AUC of 0.67 (95% CI [0.647–0.703]), specificity of 0.46, and sensitivity of 0.56 ( P = 0.7037; not significant). The LPC model showed intermediate performance, with an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI [0.713–0.751]), specificity of 0.73, and sensitivity of 0.84 ( P = 0.0269; significant at P &lt; 0.05). All P -values were derived from DeLong’s test comparing AUCs between models, with statistical significance defined as P &lt; 0.05. Of the 1,026 lymph node stations analyzed, 204 showed metastasis, while 822 did not. XGBoost consistently outperformed other models in predicting MLNM. Conclusion Combining PET-CT imaging features of primary tumors and lymph nodes with clinical and pathological data shows promise for accurately predicting MLNM in NSCLC. The TLPC model offers a non-invasive method for identifying lymph node metastasis, supporting personalized treatment strategies. However, since PET-CT was performed selectively rather than routinely acquired, external validation across diverse clinical settings is warranted to confirm model generalizability.",
