    "Abstract": "Importance Financial toxicity significantly affects individuals with cancer, impacting not only treatment adherence and outcomes but also psychological dimensions such as satisfaction with life (SWL). Identifying mediators of psychological outcomes of financial toxicity, including hopefulness and social support, is critical for informing interventions to mitigate financial toxicity burdens. Objective To examine the association of financial toxicity with hopefulness, social support, and SWL in patients with cancer, and to test the roles of hopefulness and social support in the association between financial toxicity and SWL. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional analysis assessed baseline patient-reported financial toxicity from participants of the prospective, multisite Economic Strain and Resilience in Cancer-II (ENRICh-II) study who enrolled from August 2020 to December 2022. Included patients were adults receiving ambulatory cancer care for various malignant neoplasm types diagnosed in the year prior from academic, community-based, and federally qualified health centers across 6 oncology clinics. Data were primarily analyzed between January and June 2024. Exposure Financial toxicity was assessed using the ENRICh instrument, which measures global financial toxicity burden and financial toxicity–related material, coping, and psychological distress burden subdomain scores. Main Outcomes and Measures The Satisfaction with Life Scale measured life satisfaction. Hypothesized mediators were measured using the State Hope Scale and Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey. A bootstrapping approach to multiple mediation was applied, controlling for demographic and clinical covariates. Results A total of 519 participants were surveyed (mean [SD] age, 52.0 [15.2] years; 349 female [67.2%]; 49 Black [9.4%], 137 Hispanic [26.4%], 278 White [53.6%]). The most common cancers included breast (202 [38.9%]); colon, rectum, and anal (111 [21.4%]); biliary, liver, pancreatic, and stomach (65 [12.5%]); and leukemia, lymphoma, and other hematologic malignant neoplasms (53 [10.2%]). Higher financial toxicity was significantly associated with lower SWL ( r = −0.34, P &amp;amp;lt; .001). Hopefulness and social support each partially mediated this association (social support, −0.03 [95% CI, −0.06 to −0.01]; hope, −0.08, [95% CI, −0.12 to −0.03]). The combined multiple mediation path was significant (−0.02 [95% CI, −0.04 to −0.01]). These associations also existed for the material, coping, and psychological distress financial toxicity domains. Conclusions and Relevance In this multisite, cross-sectional study, greater financial toxicity burden was associated with lower life satisfaction; individuals’ hopefulness and perceived social support levels—representing dimensions of psychosocial resilience—statistically mediated this association. These results support an approach that would embed strategies to strengthen psychosocial resilience factors, in combination with current financial assistance, to help mitigate the downstream impacts of cancer-related financial toxicity.",

    "Abstract": "Importance Conventional cancer statistics account only for individuals with a clinical diagnosis, overlooking potentially large numbers of undetected malignant neoplasms. Autopsy-based studies offer a unique opportunity to estimate the burden of cancer, including latent tumors. Objective To evaluate long-term trends and characteristics of cancers using a nationwide autopsy registry in Japan. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study of hospital-based autopsies over a 66-year period (1958-2023) obtained data from the Annual of the Pathological Autopsy Cases in Japan ( APAC-J ), a nationwide database maintained by the Japanese Society of Pathology. Latent cancers, defined as malignant neoplasms undiagnosed during life but discovered at autopsy, were analyzed based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision and International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, Third Edition . All autopsies recorded in APAC-J were included. The data were analyzed between May 7 and August 2, 2025. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was the proportion of total, multiple, and latent cancers by year, age group, and sex based on trends in latent cancer detection; metastatic status of latent cancers; and the enrichment ratio in autopsy, a novel metric comparing cancer prevalence in autopsies with national mortality statistics. Results From 1958 to 2023, 1 486 557 autopsies were registered in APAC-J (mean age based on available age group data, 59.1 years; 62.5% male), with 55.2% including cancer diagnoses. The proportion of multiple primary cancers increased from 1.8% (420 of 22 989) in 1974 to 14.4% (957 of 6661) in 2023. The enrichment ratio in autopsy was elevated in adolescents (aged 15-19 years), young adults (aged 20-24 years), and adults aged 80 years or older. Since 1986, 36 133 latent cancers were found in 34 174 of 811 159 autopsies (4.2%). The detection rate of latent cancers increased from 1.7% (683 of 39 839) in 1986 to 7.4% (493 of 6661) in 2023. Latent prostate cancer at age 75 to 79 years was identified in 4.5% (corresponding to a 2017-2021 prevalence of 656.2 per 100 000 population), 6.9-fold higher than the clinical incidence, whereas latent thyroid cancer at age 50 to 54 years showed substantially larger excesses (0.9% of men and 1.7% of women, representing 94.5-fold and 60.7-fold higher prevalences, respectively). Overall, metastases were present in 7.3% of latent cancers (2649 of 36 133). Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study of autopsies across Japan found a substantial reservoir of undiagnosed cancer, including some with metastatic potential. These findings highlight the persistent value of autopsy for assessing cancer burden and underscore the need to refine approaches for early detection while minimizing overdiagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "Importance Ocular biometrics measured by anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) predicts progression from primary angle closure suspect (PACS) to primary angle closure (PAC), but obtaining these measurements is time intensive and requires specialized software. Iridotrabecular contact (ITC), a qualitative feature readily visible on AS-OCT images from multiple devices, offers a potentially more accessible method for risk stratification, but the association between ITC and progression to PAC is unclear. Objective To investigate the association of ITC presence and length on AS-OCT images with 72-month progression from PACS to PAC. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a single-center population-based retrospective cohort study using data from the prospective Zhongshan Angle Closure Prevention (ZAP) randomized clinical trial. The untreated eyes of trial participants aged 50 to 70 years with bilateral PACS were analyzed for progression to PAC, defined as development of intraocular pressure greater than 24 mm Hg, peripheral anterior synechiae, and/or acute angle closure. ITC250/500/750 was defined as angle-opening distance of 0 mm at 250, 500, and 750 µm anterior to the scleral spur, respectively. ITC less than 250 µm in length was identified by an expert grader in images without ITC250/500/750. ITC extent was defined as the number of sectors with ITC. Risk factors for progression were evaluated using age-adjusted Cox regression models. Study data were analyzed from October 2024 to April 2025. Exposures ITC presence and length on AS-OCT images. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was 72-month progression from PACS to PAC. Results A total of 825 untreated eyes (791 without progression, 34 with progression) of 825 participants (mean [SD] age, 58.7 [5.0] years; 685 female [83.0%]) were eligible. In age-adjusted Cox models, ITC presence in the nasal sector was associated with greater risk of angle closure progression (hazard ratio [HR], 4.68; 95% CI, 1.80-12.17; P = .002; concordance index [C index] = 0.71). Greater ITC length in the nasal (HR, 1.64 per 250 µm in length; 95% CI, 1.23-2.20; P &amp;amp;lt; .001; C index = 0.70) or superior (HR, 1.72 per 250 µm in length; 95% CI, 1.11-2.66; P = .02; C index = 0.67) sector was associated with greater risk of progression. ITC extent and cumulative gonioscopy score were not associated with progression. Conclusions and Relevance Nasal ITC presence and nasal or superior ITC length were associated with greater risk of 72-month progression from PACS to PAC. These findings suggest qualitative detection of ITC provides a practical alternative to ocular biometric analysis for identifying high-risk PACS eyes.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper addresses the challenge of finite‐time trajectory tracking for four‐wheeled skid‐steering mobile robots under model uncertainties and external disturbances with unknown and state‐dependent bounds. Robust‐adaptive dual terminal sliding mode control strategies are developed to estimate perturbations modeled as a nonlinear function of the system state, ensuring stability while navigating on rough terrains. A novel approach is then introduced to reduce chattering phenomena. The proposed terminal control strategy guarantees convergence of the tracking error to zero within a predetermined finite time. Stability is proven through the Lyapunov theorem without computational burden. Finally, the numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed controllers.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This article presents the design of a proportional‐integral‐derivative (PID) controller for a renewable energy (RE) integrated power system using model order reduction (MOR). A test case of an 11th‐order RE‐integrated power system from the literature has been used to validate the applied method. The reduction of the 11th‐order Renewable Energy (RE) integrated power system model to a 2nd‐order model is achieved using a combination of Pade approximation (PA) and direct truncation (DT) (PA‐DT) method. Further, the grey wolf optimization (GWO) technique is employed to determine the optimal parameters for the PID controller for the reduced‐order model. The designed controller is then directly applied to the high‐order system (HOS). This proposed PID design method via PA‐DT MOR for the RE integrated power system is a novel technique because, at this stage, no publications related to this combined method are available. The suggested approach is supported by the time and frequency responses. Time domain specifications (TDSs) and performance error indices (PEIs), and statistical analysis are also provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the suggested method.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Non‐Hermitian band topology can give rise to phenomena with no counterparts in Hermitian systems. A well‐known example is the non‐Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where Bloch eigenstates localize at a boundary, induced by a nontrivial spectrum winding number. In contrast, recent studies on lossy non‐Hermitian lattices have uncovered an unexpected boundary‐localized loss probability—a phenomenon that requires not only non‐Hermitian band topology but also the closure of the imaginary (dissipative) gap. Here, we demonstrate the non‐Hermitian edge burst in a classical‐wave metamaterial: a lossy nonreciprocal acoustic crystal. We show that, when the imaginary gap remains closed, edge bursts can occur at the right boundary, left boundary, or both boundaries simultaneously, all under the same non‐Hermitian band topology; the latter scenario is known as a bipolar edge burst. The occurrence of each scenario depends on the number and location of the imaginary gap closure points in the eigenenergy spectra. These findings generalize the concept of edge burst from quantum to classical wave systems, establish it as an intrinsic material property, and enrich the physics of the complex interplay between non‐Hermitian band topology and other physical properties in non‐Hermitian systems.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Current cancer therapies for solid tumors are significantly hampered by the dense tumor extracellular matrix (ECM), which restricts antitumor drug penetration and accumulation. Hence, there is a critical need for controllable drug delivery systems capable of spatiotemporally controlling the sequential action of ECM‐modulating agents and cytotoxic drugs. However, conventional carriers often suffer from “non‐selective synchronous release”, failing to achieve such spatiotemporal control. Herein, we propose a spatiotemporal antitumor regimen (STAR) based on a size‐gated DNA supramolecular hydrogel (DSH) drug delivery system. In this system, a small‐molecule drug Losartan (Los) and a larger indocyanine green‐loaded platelet‐mimetic particle (ICG/PLT) are co‐encapsulated within the DSH. The programmable size‐selectivity of DSH allows for the rapid diffusion of Los to first remodel tumor ECM by reducing matrix density and enhancing tissue perfusion; meanwhile, the larger ICG/PLT particles are retained within the hydrogel structure and released later along with hydrogel degradation. Notably, this size‐gated sequential release strategy significantly enhances the accumulation of ICG/PLT at the tumor site, resulting in superior light‐activated photodynamic therapeutic outcomes against tumors. Taken together, this study establishes a novel STAR paradigm based on size‐gated DSH, holding promise to advance the therapeutic strategy for solid tumors with dense ECM.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Women's health remains inadequately served due to the historical predominance of males as the biological reference in medical research, leading to persistent sex‐based gaps in the understanding, diagnosis, and management of disease. As healthcare moves toward decentralization, e.g., through the collection of person‐generated health data, point‐of‐care diagnostics, and wearable devices, there is a critical need for tools tailored to women's unique conditions and presentations. Ultrasound technologies, recognized for their versatility and safety, have evolved from imaging to multifunctional platforms, with growing roles in diagnosis and therapy. Diagnostic ultrasound non‐invasively assesses anatomical features and functional information, and therapeutic ultrasound can perform targeted interventions, including neuromodulation, immunomodulation, thermal ablation, and drug delivery. By exploring the fundamental physical principles of ultrasound, including acoustic streaming, cavitation, and thermal interactions, and linking these mechanisms to cellular and tissue responses, this review highlights the capability of ultrasound to address female‐specific health disparities, especially in conditions that are undertreated or differentially expressed in women. Advancements in ultrasound technologies could significantly enhance clinical outcomes and improve the quality of life for women affected by conditions currently underserved by traditional medical interventions.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Halide perovskite absorber with a bandgap near 1.68 eV is pivotal for constructing perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, these wide‐bandgap perovskites are susceptible to light‐induced halide segregation and consequential non‐radiative and transport loss, severely compromising device performance and operational stability. Here, we incorporate a symmetric cross‐link agent, 4,4'‐oxydibenzenesulfonyl hydrazide, to stabilize the iodide‐bromide mixed perovskite lattice. The agents are introduced during film growth to regulate the crystallization process and subsequently assemble at grain boundaries, where they firmly anchor to the perovskite grain surface and stabilize the chemically active boundary regions. Through this approach, photostable wide‐bandgap perovskites are achieved, exhibiting enhanced crystallinity, reduced band‐tail states, and suppressed halide segregation and lattice decomposition. The resultant 1.68 eV single‐junction devices delivered an independently certified power conversion efficiency of 23.48%. When integrated with silicon heterojunction cells, the resulting two‐terminal monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem devices exhibited a power conversion efficiency of 32.19%, and retained 90% of their initial efficiency after 1020 h of continuous operation.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a chronic complication of diabetes, primarily caused by hyperglycemia, peripheral vascular disease, and neuropathy. Characterized by persistent hyperglycemia, impaired perfusion, inflammation, and infection, DFUs pose significant challenges to healing and are associated with high morbidity and amputation rates. Traditional treatments struggle to balance infection control and tissue regeneration, necessitating more effective strategies. Recent advancements in nanotechnology have led to the development of responsive nanocomposite hydrogels tailored for DFU management. These hydrogels, incorporating nanomaterials with photothermal and ROS‐scavenging properties, can dynamically modulate the wound environment to promote tissue repair. This review explores the latest innovations in nanomaterial‐based hydrogels for DFU, highlighting their multifunctionality, clinical challenges, and future potential to enhance patient outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Ultrablack materials with high absorption have emerged as fundamentally crucial absorption layers for stray light suppression. Despite significant advances, large‐scale production of blackbody sheets with periodic array architectures and excellent mechanical durability over broadband and large angles still remained great challenges in state‐of‐the‐art light‐absorbing materials. Rational light‐trapping structure design was essential to reduce reflectance. Here, we proposed a simple two‐step procedure of micromachining and replica moulding, verified by theoretical simulation, to fabricate robust superblack materials. The resultant ultrablack showed periodic micro‐pyramid arrays with precise nanoscale structures. The vertically aligned micro‐pyramids enabled multiple internal light reflection which significantly exceeded the wavelength of interest endowed the low‐reflection properties over broad wavelengths. Furthermore carbon black nanoparticles achieved reduced backscattering. Meanwhile, nanometrically features of pyramids hindered diffuse photon escape effectively. The hemispherical reflectance below 0.004 of hierarchical black sheets was achieved. The sheets maintained high resilience modulus and exceptional mechanical endurance. ‌This preparation method was applied to fabricate a barrel shading hood of lens from epoxy resin composites. Integration of this method with a roll‐to‐roll process made industrial‐scale production possible, indicating their application potential. This work provided a novel perspective for robust ultrablack sheets with highly effective absorption, ‌large‐scale preparation, and excellent ‌abrasion resistance.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Emerging applications in the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, and robotics expose energy and latency bottlenecks in conventional photo‐sensing based on the von Neumann architecture. In‐sensor computing has emerged as a promising alternative by integrating multiple functions into a single device. 2D materials are widely used for prototypes owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties; however, free‐space illumination poses several challenges. First, the limited light–matter interaction length‐yields low absorption. Second, although logic and neuromorphic functions can combine electrical and optical signals, free‐space coupling hinders dense interconnection. Finally, these applications often require infrared operation, which remains challenging for commonly used transition metal disulfides (TMDs). Here, we report a waveguide‐integrated multifunctional photodetector for on‐chip in‐sensor computing that integrates light detection, nonvolatile memory, and reconfigurable logic/synaptic operations. Efficient infrared detection at 1552.5 nm is achieved, with a normalized photocurrent‐to‐dark‐current ratio (NPDR) up to 6.4 × 10 3 m W −1 . After negative control‐gate pulses programming, the device exhibits a projected retention of 21.1% after 10 years. We further realize an “AND” logic and synaptic short‐ and long‐term memory (STM/LTM). These results advance on‐chip in‐sensor computing compatible with high‐density photonic‐electronic interconnects and highlight a route toward systems that can sense, store, and compute at the point of capture.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Cu 2 CdSnSe 4 (CCTSe), a quaternary chalcogenide semiconductor, combines earth‐abundant elements, a high absorption coefficient, and a narrow bandgap, making it an attractive absorber for broadband photodetectors. However, current research on CCTSe photodetectors predominantly relies on vacuum‐based techniques; these methods not only suffer from high costs and complex operation but also face challenges in large‐scale production. To address these limitations, we propose and demonstrate a sulfur‐free precursor one‐step solution process for the fabrication of self‐powered CCTSe thin film photodetectors. By optimizing the selenization process, the resulting CCTSe films exhibit significantly enhanced crystallinity, with effectively suppressed defect states‐key improvements that enable exceptional zero‐bias performance. Specifically, the photodetector achieves a responsivity of 0.52 A/W, a specific detectivity of 5.18 × 10 12 Jones, and a dark current on the order of 10 −9 A. Notably, the device maintains a stable photoresponse under repeated on‐off switching cycles at a typical broadband near‐infrared wavelength 1550 nm, which confirms its excellent photostability and reliable detection capability. These findings validate that the proposed sulfur‐free precursor solution process not only enables high‐performance CCTSe photodetectors but also provides a cost‐effective and scalable pathway for the development of next‐generation broadband visible to near‐infrared optoelectronic devices.",

To address this, we analyzed uncertainty propagation from estimated parameters in a previously introduced column model and assessed identifiability via ill‐conditioning analysis. Extrapolation was evaluated by estimating parameters from fluid dynamic experiments and validating with mass transfer data. Using a DN50 pulsed sieve tray column, parameters , and the swarm exponent were estimated through maximum likelihood, as they directly affect online‐measurable drop diameter and hold‐up . Incorporating these estimates, the model reproduced , , and stationary and transient concentration profiles with relative errors below 10%.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Chirality transfer across hierarchical architectures represents a pivotal and underexplored challenge in the design of functional chiral materials. Through molecular engineering integrating chiral α ‐terminal groups with electronically tunable azobenzene (Azo) side chains, we demonstrate that in kinetically trapped aggregates of side chain Azo polymers, the dipole moment of the chromophore, modulated by terminal electron‐donating (Donor, D) or withdrawing (Acceptor, A) substituents, dictates the absolute inversion of the resulting supramolecular helix. The substituent‐dependent dipole reorientation cascades into long‐range helical reorganization via π‐π and van der Waals cooperativity, ultimately governing whether chirality transfer follows thermodynamic preference, undergoes inversion, or exhibits multiplexed behavior. This electronically driven chirality inversion transcends classical steric models and establishes a transformative framework for designing adaptive chiral materials with programmable handedness, offering promising applications in photonic circuits, enantioselective nanosensors, and bioinspired metamaterials.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Chlorine evolution reaction (CER) is pivotal to the chlor‐alkali industry, while its operation still relies on the dimensionally stable anode (DSA) developed decades ago, which is hindered by high costs, moderate selectivity, and limited energy efficiency. Here, we present a spinel‐type hexavalent iridium single‐site electrocatalyst ( spinel ‐ iso ‐Ir VI ) via strategic modulation of delocalized electron distribution that demonstrates exceptional CER performance. This catalyst operates with an ultralow overpotential of 27 mV at 10 mA cm −2 (57 mV for commercial DSA), a nearly 100% CER selectivity across a wide potential range, and a record energy efficiency of 83.5% at an industrial‐level current density of ∼300 mA cm −2 . At the overpotential of 100 mV, spinel ‐ iso ‐Ir VI delivers a mass activity of 9671 mA mg Ru+Ir −1 and a turnover frequency of 0.278 s −1 , surpassing those of the benchmark DSA by over 386‐fold and 20‐fold, respectively. The high‐performance of spinel ‐ iso ‐Ir VI results in a low production cost of US$0.04 per kilogram of chlorine. Mechanism studies reveal a two‐step chemical‐electrochemical cycle reaction mechanism, in which the chemical reaction step involves a spontaneous redox reaction triggered by hexavalent Ir VI sites. This process enables the spontaneous adsorption, bonding, and oxidation of Cl − to generate Cl 2 , thereby significantly boosting the reaction kinetics.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Here we present a five‐step synthesis of two circular polarized light emitting donor–acceptor (D–A) [17]helicenes. The concise yet high‐yielding synthetic strategy was achieved by dedicated precursor design, with bond‐order control and substitution effects, for photocyclization. The structures and chiroptical properties of D–A [17]helicenes were comprehensively characterized by NMR, HRMS, UV–vis, CD, fluorescence and CPL spectroscopies, as well as single‐crystal X‐ray diffraction. By introducing D–A system into helicene scaffold, we demonstrate a nearly 10‐fold increase in fluorescence quantum yield compared to the unsubstituted [14]helicene, due to an enhanced fluorescence emission rate ( k f ). The emission wavelength can be tuned by introducing different functional groups. D–A [17]helicenes emitting circularly polarized light with a dissymmetry factor ( g lum ) of up to 1 × 10 −2 . DFT calculations reveal that D–A functionalization increases the oscillator strengths ( f ) thereby increasing k f . This highly efficient synthetic strategy not only facilitates the synthesis of the longest chiral helicene reported to date but also establishes design principles for developing chiral long helicenes with circularly polarized light emission.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Sodium‐ion hybrid capacitors (SHCs) are severely hindered by sluggish sodiation kinetics in conventional anodes. Single‐atom sites, though promising, suffer from localized d ‐orbitals that induce overly strong Na + binding, creating a kinetic bottleneck. Herein, we design heteroatomic FeCo dual‐atom sites (FeCoN 6 ) that unlock a dual‐mechanism synergy for fast and durable Na + storage. Theoretical‐experimental evidence confirms that strong d–d orbital coupling induces an orbital‐mediated charge‐delocalization (OMCD) effect, which downshifts the d ‐band center to moderate Na + binding affinity. Meanwhile, the intrinsic heteroatomic nature of the FeCoN 6 sites provides a stepped energy landscape for optimized Na + capture‐release pathways. This synergy between electronic OMCD modulation and the kinetic capture‐release model significantly lowers the diffusion barrier. Consequently, the FeCo dual‐atom nitrogen‐doped carbon anode exhibits dominant pseudocapacitive kinetics, superior rate capability (225 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 ), and exceptional durability. The full SHC delivers a high energy density of 165 Wh kg −1 at 23 W kg −1 , retains 108 Wh kg −1 at 9424 W kg −1 , and achieves 90% capacity retention over 10,000 cycles. This study establishes that engineering heteroatomic sites to leverage both intrinsic functional heterogeneity and electronic delocalization is a powerful strategy to overcome kinetic limitations in energy storage.",

The precisely controlled pyrene excimer conformations in these structures enable adjustable photophysical behaviors, particularly in circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), including tunable luminescence dissymmetry factors ( g lum ), invertible handedness, and programmable emission wavelengths. Notably, introducing a third pyrene unit into tris‐pyrene‐functionalized [1]rotaxanes further modulates CPL properties through synergistic or antagonistic interactions, as further confirmed by time‐dependent density functional theory (TD‐DFT) simulations, revealing a previously unobserved stacking effect. This correlation between spatial stacking and photophysical response not only provides more in‐depth fundamental insights for pyrene excimer emissions but also offers critical design principles for developing advanced chiral luminescent materials.",

Metabolite differences were assessed, and enriched pathway analysis was performed to identify significantly altered metabolic pathways. Neonates exposed to PTU exhibited distinct metabolic profiles compared with controls, characterized by significantly reduced levels of histidine and aspartic acid. These differential metabolites were primarily enriched in ammonia recycling as well as glycine and serine metabolism pathways—closely associated with protein and nucleotide biosynthesis. These findings indicate that prenatal exposure to PTU in hyperthyroid mothers leads to characteristic alterations in neonatal blood metabolic profiles, suggesting the need for close monitoring of growth and developmental outcomes in this population.",

METHODS We modeled people aged 71 across three scenarios: 18 months of lecanemab, collaborative care, and combined interventions. Outcomes included quality‐adjusted life years (QALYs), 2024 costs, and incremental cost‐effectiveness ratios (ICERs) as appropriate. RESULTS Per person, collaborative care (vs usual care) increased QALYs by 0.26 with savings of $48,000 (dominant); adding lecanemab to collaborative care yielded an additional 0.16 QALYs at a total cost per QALY of $218,000 (societal perspective) and $248,000 (healthcare perspective). When scaled to the US population, lecanemab yielded 180,000 QALYs at a cost of $39.5 billion; collaborative care yielded 1.5 million QALYs and saved $300 billion. Findings were robust to uncertainties. DISCUSSION Collaborative dementia care offers health and economic benefits and should be prioritized for widespread implementation.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Drawing on the Resource‐Based View (RBV) and Stakeholder Theory, this study examines how green innovation contributes to firm value, emphasizing the mediating role of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance and the moderating role of corporate reputation. Using panel data from 593 environmentally sensitive manufacturing firms across Asian economies between 2014 and 2023, the proposed relationships are tested with the Baron and Kenney mediation approach and IV‐2SLS estimation to address potential endogeneity. The results demonstrate that green innovation directly enhances firm value and significantly improves ESG performance. ESG performance itself exerts a positive effect on firm value, and mediation analysis reveals that ESG partially transmits the impact of green innovation on financial outcomes. Robustness checks strengthen these findings: The Variance Accounted For (VAF) ratio shows that 41.2% of the total effect of green innovation on firm value operates through ESG, while the Sobel test ( Z = 3.462, p &lt; 0.001) and the Z ‐test of mediation ( Z = 3.291, p &lt; 0.01) confirm the significance of the indirect pathway. These results provide consistent evidence that ESG is an important, though partial, channel linking innovation to value creation. Furthermore, corporate reputation is found to strengthen the effect of green innovation on firm value, suggesting that reputational capital amplifies the benefits of sustainability engagement. The study contributes to theory by integrating RBV and Stakeholder perspectives and offers practical insights for Asian manufacturing firms, where aligning innovation strategies with ESG improvements and reputation management is crucial for sustainable competitiveness.",

Drawing on practice‐informed initiatives, the paper describes how AI‐infused faculty development, including live, performative demonstrations using VerseBot, a custom instructional AI persona built on ChatGPT, addresses faculty concerns related to teaching effectiveness, student engagement, academic integrity, and resource disparities. Embedding AI literacy and ethical guidance within first‐year coursework, alongside structured professional development such as Association of College and University Educators (ACUE) certification, positions AI as a supportive instructional resource rather than a substitute for pedagogy. By situating AI integration within a layered faculty development model that combines policy alignment, culturally responsive practice, and hands‐on experimentation, this paper offers transferable insights for urban‐serving universities and community colleges seeking to leverage emerging technologies while upholding commitments to access, equity, and academic rigor.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The targeted degradation of RNA, particularly long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs), holds immense potential for therapeutic interventions in diseases associated with aberrant RNA regulation. Here, we introduce a novel Proximity–Induced Nucleic Acid Degrader ( PINAD–1) , a first‐in‐class small molecule that selectively induces the degradation of MALAT1, a lncRNA implicated in the regulation of metastatic processes. PINAD–1 is designed by conjugating a binder specific for the triple helix structure of MALAT1 to an imidazole‐based RNA‐degrading warhead, enabling specific cleavage of the MALAT1 transcript in vitro and in cellulo, with minimal off‐target effects on the structurally similar NEAT1 lncRNA. Through mechanistic studies, we show that effective RNA degradation is not solely dependent on proximity but requires a precise structural context, as demonstrated by the differential activity of PINAD–1 compared to the structurally analogous but functionally inert conjugate PINAD–2 . Our findings underscore the importance of binder‐induced destabilization and RNA geometry in facilitating RNA degradation. This work lays the foundation for the design of bifunctional small‐molecule RNA degraders as powerful tools for the modulation of structured noncoding RNAs, offering potential applications in RNA‐based therapeutics.",

    "Abstract": "Comprehensive Summary The development of efficient electrocatalysts for the reduction of nitrate (NO 3 ‐ ) to ammonia (NH 3 ) offers a sustainable alternative to the energy‐intensive Haber–Bosch process, positioning this approach as a key focus in low‐carbon and environmental research. However, practical implementation of the nitrate reduction reaction (NO 3 ‐ RR) remains challenging due to the complexity of proton‐coupled electron transfer and the sluggish kinetics arising from diverse reaction intermediates. In this work, we present an asymmetric Fe/Mn diatomic catalyst anchored on a metal–organic framework (MOF)‐derived carbon skeleton, which exhibits outstanding catalytic performance for NH 3 synthesis, achieving a Faradaic efficiency of 98.7% at −0.4 V vs. RHE. Through combined in situ X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we reveal that in the asymmetric Fe‐Mn/SNC structure, strong electronic coupling between Fe and Mn active sites, together with synergistic modulation by S and N atoms, effectively optimizes the electronic structure, enhances structural stability, and ensures optimal atomic dispersion. The proposed transverse coordination‐asymmetric heteronuclear diatomic cooperation mechanism provides a novel design strategy for advancing nitrate reduction and electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Although green manufacturing certification (GMC) has gained growing attention as a voluntary environmental regulation for green development, empirical evidence on its effectiveness remains scarce. This study identifies the causal effect of the GMC program on corporate green transformation, using panel data of 3441 listed manufacturing companies in China from 2008 to 2023. Employing a staggered difference‐in‐differences approach, the results show that GMC significantly promotes green transformation, with certified firms exhibiting more substantial improvements than their non‐certified peers. We identify three possible mechanisms driving this positive effect: enhanced environmental investment, strengthened green management, and improved technology development. The positive effects are more pronounced in non‐state‐owned enterprises, larger and older firms, and those operating in clean, technology‐intensive industries and regions with weaker environmental constraints. Our findings support the collaborative governance effect of voluntary environmental regulation and provide valuable insights into promoting green development in emerging economies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In this study, we present a theoretical analysis of the shear viscosity ( η ) in three‐dimensional dusty plasmas (DPs) through molecular dynamics simulations under the influence of an external electric field ( E ). The Green‐Kubo formula is applied to compute η across various values of E , Coulomb coupling, and screening parameters. The simulation results of η at zero E (= 0.0) are compared with existing data and discuss the applicability of the Green‐Kubo formula. It is found that this method provides overestimations but is still applicable to approximation investigations of η in cooled liquid states of DPs. Further, our investigations reveal that η is anisotropic when applied to E . The results of anisotropic η in DP liquids identify three distinct regimes. The first is a slight decrease in η , indicating the presence of repulsive interactions at low E values. The second is a rapid increase, suggesting strong, attractive interactions at intermediate E values. The third shows relatively stable behavior, indicating saturation at high E values. The obtained values of η as a function of normalized temperature follow the temperature scaling law. Furthermore, dust particles align along the z ‐axis and form clusters; the number and size of the clusters depend on the strength of the E . We show that using the Green‐Kubo relation with a wake potential in DPs provides reliable and accurate predictions of E impact on η . These results enhance understanding of the anisotropic η and electrorheological properties of DPs, offering valuable insights into structural transitions influenced by the E .",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT For decades, rodent social isolation models have been used to explore how social experience influences brain maturation and adult behavioral outcomes, but studies employing these models have produced seemingly inconsistent experimental results. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the effects of social isolation during development on adult social behavior, highlighting how differences in experimental paradigms (including the duration and timing of isolation, the sex of subjects, and whether subjects are returned to social housing prior to testing) can help explain disparate experimental results across the four most‐studied types of social behaviors in rodent social isolation research (social preference, social investigation, agonistic behavior, and social recognition). Our analysis shows that experimental results are not as inconsistent as they may seem at first glance and that understanding the nuances of rodent social isolation paradigms is necessary for the field to be able to leverage these models to discover the neural mechanisms underlying experience‐dependent shaping of social behavior.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Elite law enforcement and special forces operators around the world have a unique skill set, including some risky methods of entry into a scene of operation. With fast roping being actively utilized by this population, it is important to gain an understanding of the physical demands of the task. Thirty‐seven Law Enforcement Officers (LEOs) completed five 20 ft fast rope descents onto a force platform, three in standard uniform (without kit) and two with the additional weight of operational kit (with kit). Additionally, 12 LEOs were also fitted with electromyography on their dominant arm. Landing forces with and without kit showed no significant difference. Participants with hang test time (HTT) &lt; 35s showed significantly poorer Landing Control (LC) when descending with kit ( p &lt; 0.01). Landing control played an important role, with peak landing force significantly higher ( p = 0.025) in uncontrolled landings. CMJ breaking impulse and rebound jump height are the main physical measurable predictors. However, when adjusting for body weight and kit, only rebound jump height remained predictive with marginal significance ( p = 0.06) ( R 2 = 0.45, p = 0.008). The biceps brachii (BB) exhibited greater activation when descending with kit ( p = 0.003). However, the extensor carpi radialis exhibited the greatest activation during descents in both conditions ( p &lt; 0.003). Landing impact forces were not significantly different between groups, however longer HTT correlated with more controlled descents and reduced landing forces. The ECR was observed to be the muscle with the highest activation on all descents, with only the BB increasing in kit.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective Conceptualizing functional/dissociative seizures (FDS) as resulting from dissociation, or conversion, we hypothesized that, compared to epileptic seizures (ES), FDS should carry more symbolic or communicative content and that this would allow observers to distinguish FDS from ES. Methods Three independent, epileptologically naive raters evaluated home videos of patients with confirmed diagnoses of either FDS or ES using a standardized form. The focus of the ratings was explicitly not on seizure semiology, but on verbal and nonverbal behavior, the role of proxies, interaction patterns, communication, emotional tone, symbolic content, and situational context. Results Of 598 home videos available from 183 patients, 215 ES and 95 FDS videos were suitable for analysis. No explicit symbolic communication was identified. FDS showed more passive, withdrawn behavior, and the postictal phase—captured more often than the ictal period—was particularly helpful for distinguishing FDS from ES. Interrater reliability was moderate. Features observed more commonly in FDS included closed eyes, recumbent posture, repetitive movements, reduced eye contact, responses to caring behavior, and occurrence in private settings. Raters perceived greater emotional distress in FDS and reported more distress watching these videos. Logistic regression based on all ratings correctly classified 94% of ES but only 32% of FDS. Significance Home video analysis captures important contextual and behavioral features of FDS and ES. The differential diagnostic reliability of lay raters' perceptions is limited. Findings suggest that FDS comprise passive rather than active appellative communication, likely reflecting emotional regulation processes. In contrast, in the home videos studied, ES patients exhibit greater postictal awareness and interaction than FDS patients, pointing to the relevance of the postictal phase for discriminating both seizure types. The results emphasize integrating environmental context and patient–caregiver interactions before, during, and after seizures to understand the functional significance of FDS in naturalistic, nonclinical settings.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective Long‐term memory deficits are often seen in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Recently, studies showed that patients with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) type 2, which presents with severe neuron loss in CA1 only, performed within the normal range. However, up to 30% of HS type 2 cases have memory deficits. As insulin‐like growth factor 1 (IGF‐1) is related to neurogenesis and memory performance, we sought to investigate a possible link between the expression of IGF‐1 receptor (IGF‐1R) and verbal memory performance among patients with HS type 2. Methods We selected 21 patients with left‐side TLE and HS type 2. Based on presurgical neuropsychological assessment, we divided the patients into a group with normal long‐term verbal memory (Preserved group, n = 15) and another with memory deficit (Deficit group, n = 6). To classify the patients, we used performance on the late recall subitems in the Logical Memory test of the Wechsler Memory Scale and late recall in Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Coronal hippocampal sections at the body level were submitted to immunohistochemistry for NeuN and IGF‐1R to evaluate neuron density and IGF‐1R expression, respectively. Results Patients with preserved memory had the same clinical characteristics as those with memory deficit. The groups had no difference on the short‐term subitem of Logical Memory or on RAVLT learning. The Deficit group had lower scores on both long‐term memory subitems. Neuron density was also similar among patients in the Preserved and Deficit groups. IGF‐1R expression was significantly higher in the granule cell layer and in CA2 in the Preserved group compared to the Deficit group, and IGF‐1 expression had strong positive correlation with both the learning and long‐term subitems of RAVLT. Significance Lower IGF‐1 pathway activity is associated with long‐term memory deficit in patients with HS type 2.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Synthetic ammonia is of great significance to the development of industry and agriculture. At present, its manufacturing production is still dominated by century‐old Haber–Bosch process, involving in huge amounts of energy consumptions and carbon dioxide emissions. Hence, it is of great significance to develop green and sustainable alternative technologies, such as photo‐, thermo‐, and electro‐catalytic syntheses of ammonia. Nevertheless, the intrinsic inertness of nitrogen results in low ammonia yield of above candidates, which still cannot meet commercialization expectations. Recent researches have successfully demonstrated that plasma can effectively activate the decomposition of nitrogen and hydrogen under ambient conditions, thereby significantly improving the ammonia yield of these alternative strategies. This review systematically summarizes the classification and reaction mechanism of plasma for this reason, and discusses the synergy between different plasma and catalytic methods along with energy consumptions in detail. In the meantime, the future development trend is also forecasted.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The genus Piper (Piperaceae) is one of the most diverse groups of tropical plants, with its species extensively used in traditional medicine and the pharmaceutical industry. Among them, Piper nigrum L. (black pepper) is distinguished by its economic relevance and biotechnological potential, owing to the presence of alkaloids, oleoresins, and essential oils (EOs) rich in bioactive monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes. The composition of these metabolites varies according to physiological and environmental conditions, particularly at the stage of fruit maturation, which modulates the chemical profile and bioactivity of the EOs. In this study, we investigated the influence of different stages of fruit maturation on the chemical composition and biological properties of P. nigrum EOs. The oils were extracted by hydrodistillation from black (sun‐dried), red (ripe), yellow (mid‐ripening), and green (unripe) P. nigrum fruits. The volatile composition of the EOs was determined by GC–MS, while antioxidant and cytotoxic activities were evaluated using the DPPH• and ABTS• + radical scavenging assays and the MTT assay, respectively. A total of 115 volatile constituents were identified, predominantly oxygenated monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which exhibited marked qualitative and quantitative variations among the fruit maturation stages. The EO obtained from ripe fruits displayed the highest antioxidant and cytotoxic activities, which correlated with the enrichment in limonene, β‐pinene and α‐bisabolol. In contrast, the green stage showed greater chemical diversity but lower bioactivity. These findings demonstrate that fruit ripening triggers enzymatic and oxidative transformations that directly modulate the composition and functionality of P. nigrum EOs. The integration of chemical and biological analyses provides new insights into the metabolic dynamics of P. nigrum and supports the optimization of harvest timing to maximise the pharmacological and industrial value of the species. This study advances our understanding of the relationship between fruit maturation, phytochemistry and the bioactivity of tropical aromatic species, reinforcing P. nigrum as a model for biotechnological research in natural product chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Soybean represents the largest imported agricultural product in China. Imported soybeans are typically transported via maritime shipping. During transportation, soybeans in enclosed cargo holds are highly susceptible to thermal damage due to increasing environmental temperature and humidity. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of soybean heat damage, a differential proteomics approach was employed, utilizing a data‐independent acquisition (DIA) strategy. This methodology identified 1670 distinct differentially expressed proteins. Notably, proteins associated with fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis exhibited downregulated expression levels in heat‐damaged soybeans. Conversely, proteins involved in mitigating oxidative stress damage, regulating protein synthesis, and maintaining metabolic homeostasis demonstrated upregulated expression. The study reveals that heat‐stressed soybeans adapt to elevated temperatures through coordinate regulation of destructive and protective protein expression ‐ suppressing detrimental proteins while enhancing beneficial ones. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for optimizing storage conditions and maintaining the superior quality of soybeans during transportation and storage.",

Solar‐powered water purification, particularly via passive systems, offers an environmentally sound and energy‐efficient pathway to address this challenge. Among the different solar still configurations, spherical designs (SPSS) stand out as a noteworthy advancement, based on their unique geometry that ensures uniform solar energy absorption, improved thermal efficiency, and a compact form suitable for off‐grid and remote applications.This review delivers an in‐depth and up‐to‐date examination of advancements in SPSS technology, focusing on recent integrations such as wick‐based evaporation systems, nanoparticle‐infused phase change materials (PCMs), reflective surfaces, internal baffles, and rotational mechanisms. Collectively, these improvements have led to significant enhancements in distillate output, with some designs achieving performance increases of up to 259% relative to traditional setups. By critically examining experimental research, modeling approaches, and techno‐economic evaluations, this review outlines the current landscape, identifies key limitations, and explores emerging strategies to enhance efficient and cost‐effective SPSS systems.The analysis underscores the role of SPSS as a promising and scalable method for generating clean water, particularly suited to sun‐rich regions facing resource constraints.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This study numerically evaluates heat‐transfer enhancement in compact fin‐and‐tube heat exchangers by combining fin‐pitch optimization with surface‐mounted vortex generators (VGs). A preliminary scan of two fin pitches (15 and 25 mm) identifies 15 mm as the superior baseline, delivering ~7.4% higher convective coefficient. Building on this geometry, two VG shapes—triangular and semi‐cylindrical—are assessed for thermal‐hydraulic performance using validated 3‐D CFD. The semi‐cylindrical VG consistently outperforms the triangular one, increasing heat transfer by &gt; 17% under comparable conditions owing to stronger, more persistent longitudinal vortices near the heat‐transfer surfaces. The model reproduces the published benchmarks with deviations &lt; 5.5%. Additional parametric tests across Reynolds number and inlet‐air temperature confirm the robustness of these trends. Overall, coupling an optimized fin pitch with a semi‐cylindrical VG yields a compact exchanger with markedly improved heat‐transfer performance, offering practical guidance for high‐efficiency HVAC and automotive applications.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This panel study examines changes in attitudes towards Ukrainian and Russian minorities in the Czech Republic and their links to disinformation beliefs and democratic commitment. The data were obtained from 490 respondents in a Czech quota sample (age 18–69; M = 46.09, SD = 13.40; 45.7% women). Between 2022 and 2025, mean favorability towards both groups declined: evaluations of Ukrainians shifted from slightly positive to slightly negative, while evaluations of Russians dropped from slightly to markedly negative. A repeated measures ANOVA showed that these changes were moderated by respondents' belief in disinformation and democratic orientation. Respondents resilient to disinformation and committed to democracy (‘Rational Pro‐Ukrainians’) maintained positive attitudes towards Ukrainians and showed only a medium further decline in already negative attitudes towards Russians. In contrast, respondents vulnerable to disinformation and less democratically oriented (‘Generally Disinformed’ and ‘Pro‐Russians’) displayed a sharp decline in attitudes towards Ukrainians—to strongly negative, polarising levels—while their views of Russians deteriorated only slightly. The results suggest that pro‐democratic individuals remained guided by empathy, humanism and in‐group solidarity (Social Identity Theory), whereas disinformed non‐democrats adopted out‐group, threat‐based perceptions (Realistic Threat Theory). Overall, rationality and democratic commitment appear to buffer against disinformation and polarisation, sustaining solidarity with democratic allies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Molybdenum disulfide (MoS 2 ) is regarded as a promising next‐generation semiconductor material for high‐end microelectronic chips due to its excellent properties. However, due to the atomic thickness of two‐dimensional materials (2DMs), the interactions between these materials and their supporting substrates cannot be ignored, which affects the intrinsic properties of 2DMs. In this work, we investigated the influence of the substrate on the performance of MoS 2 devices. As compared to supported MoS 2 field‐effect transistors (FETs), the suspended MoS 2 FET exhibits more intrinsic properties of a threshold voltage ( V th ) shift toward 0 V and the current on/off ratio increases by 3 orders of magnitude. Moreover, by varying the trench/channel ratio in the MoS 2 FETs, we can effectively modulate the electrical performance of MoS 2 . An increase in the trench/channel ratio results in a shift of the V th from −40 to −5 V, approaching the ideal value. Concurrently, the subthreshold swing is reduced by approximately an order of magnitude to ~200 mV dec –1 (from ~3600 mV/dec), and the mobility is enhanced from ~1 to 100 cm 2 V −1 s −1 . To mitigate the effects of contact resistance and other extrinsic factors, we fabricated a suspended Hall‐bar MoS 2 device, achieving a mobility of 96.8 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , more than double the 37.0 cm 2 V −1 s −1 measured in a supported device. This work demonstrates a practical approach for enhancing the properties of 2D semiconductor devices, facilitating the development of high‐performance electronics. image",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Personal and national identities can play a pivotal role in understanding youth well‐being in increasingly diverse societies. However, previous research has predominantly focused on Western contexts, overlooking youth from non‐Western societies. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of research that simultaneously examined both personal and national identities in relation to well‐being. To address this gap, this study focused on youth belonging to a majority group in Japan, confronting augmented cultural variations, and addressed relationships between personal and national identities and their links to well‐being. Methods This cross‐sectional study included 968 university students in Japan aged 18–29 years ( M age = 20.06, SD = 1.17; 51.34% women) who identified their nationality as Japanese. Participants completed in 2016 self‐report questionnaires, including measures of personal and national identity processes and well‐being. Results Personal identity commitment and in‐depth exploration were positively associated with national identity exploration and commitment, whereas personal identity reconsideration of commitment was positively associated with national identity exploration. Personal identity commitment and national identity exploration were positively related to well‐being, and personal identity reconsideration of commitment was negatively related to well‐being. Conclusions This study contributes to understanding the interplay between personal and national identity processes and their relations with well‐being among youth in a majority group outside Western countries. Given the importance of identity for young people's adjustment and for fostering their sense of social responsibility, this study may have significant practical implications for promoting both individual well‐being and social cohesion.",

The pathophysiology of PLE varies depending on the etiology and involves either intestinal mucosal injury or lymphatic system alterations. While transient PLE can occur in the setting of viral infections, persistent or recurrent PLE requires comprehensive evaluation and multidisciplinary management approach. Here, we present two cases of PLE: the first case secondary to a common pediatric infection and the second case of primary intestinal lymphangiectasia with severe symptoms improved with diet therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Camellia sinensis , widely consumed as tea, is the second most popular beverage globally and is valued for its health benefits. However, environmental stressors pose a significant challenge to the tea industry. This study investigates the potential of shikimic acid (ShA) and its derivative, salicylic acid (SA), as inducers to enhance polyphenol content and antioxidant activity across different growth stages. Results Experiments on Biclonal Tea Stock 1 (BTS1) family plants, including 4‐month‐old seedlings and 2‐year‐old plants, revealed significant increases in polyphenol levels and antioxidant activity following induction, though effects diminished over time. SA provided a stronger initial boost, whereas ShA sustained longer‐lasting effects. Two‐year‐old plants exhibited greater baseline polyphenol levels and a stronger response to induction than seedlings. A strong correlation between polyphenol accumulation and antioxidant activity was also observed. Molecular docking simulations suggested that SA signaling facilitates NPR1‐TGA and NPR1‐WRKY binding to the PAL promoter, enhancing PAL gene transcription. Additionally, polyphenols such as flavones, p‐coumaric acid, gallic acid, and caffeic acid were found to interact with the PAL enzyme through mechanisms similar to that of trans‐cinnamic acid and may, therefore, act as feedback inhibitors in a manner analogous to trans‐cinnamic acid. Conclusion These findings provide novel insights into optimizing tea plant defenses and enhancing polyphenol‐related health benefits, offering potential strategies for improving tea quality and resilience against environmental stress.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Balancing ecosystem‐service supply and demand is central to understanding both the natural and social dimensions of ecosystem services and to enhancing human well‐beings. Concurrently, collaborative efforts are underway to improve multiple ecosystem services, including the promotion of carbon neutrality and water purification (WP) within basin regions. Here, we quantified the WP and carbon sequestration (CS) of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) and explored the driving mechanism of two ecosystem services from the perspective of supply and demand. The results reveal that CS and WP of TGRA have generally achieved a balance between supply and demand over the past 30 years. WP‐supply showed a significant decline (−6.25 × 10 2 t/year), while CS‐supply exhibited steady growth (20.27 × 10 4 tC/year). WP‐demand experienced a slight reduction (−8.42 × 10 2 t/year), whereas CS‐demand increased sharply (73.7 × 10 4 tC/year). Spatial analysis indicated that both CS and WP supply–demand reachability peaked in regions exceeding 1000 m in elevation and 25° in slope. WP exhibited strong spatial clustering, with high–high agglomerations predominantly located in the central Yangtze and southwestern areas, and low–low clusters concentrated in northern and southern zones. However, CS exhibited distinct spatial variation, featuring high–low zones in the east and low–high zones in the southwest. Climate factors significantly enhanced WP‐supply (0.41) and WP‐demand (0.54) but inhibited both CS‐supply (−0.11) and CS‐demand (−0.05). Socioeconomic factors are positively related to CS‐demand (0.94) while negatively impacting CS‐supply (−0.38). Soil factors exerted a positive influence on CS‐supply (0.35) but a negative effect on WP‐supply (−0.37). Moreover, management strategies in the TGRA should integrate spatially targeted measures for WP to address local supply–demand gaps, along with a spatially regulated regional “cap and trade” mechanism to sustain CS surplus. Supported by vegetation restoration and coordinated water–carbon governance, this approach can strengthen WP–CS synergies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aim This study aims to perform optical dosimetry in the patient's chest using Monte Carlo simulation, quantifying absorbed optical energy and photon fluence as a function of depth in biological tissue during arthritis rheumatoid photo‐treatment. Method The MCLTmx code was employed to simulate light transport. A 532, 630, 660, and 850 nm external monoenergetic light source was simulated. The optical energy deposited and photon fluence as a function of depth were calculated under the structural arrangement: source‐air‐skin‐fat‐muscle . Results Experimental validation was successful. The results indicate that the skin receives, on average, three orders of magnitude more optical energy than fat and muscle for all wavelengths. Conclusion The dosimetry developed in this manuscript will serve as a valuable tool to correlate the power of the light source with dosimetric quantities, such as absorbed optical energy and photon fluence, and subsequently with the response to phototreatment. Once this correlation is established, the required irradiation time and power to produce favorable effects in patients suffering from RA can be calculated.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Pyrazine dicarbonitriles functionalized with allyl groups (APQ and BAPPQ) were synthesized to address the high melting point and low curing reactivity of conventional phthalonitrile (PN) resins. APQ exhibits significantly reduced melting temperatures (as low as 50.9 °C) and curing initiation temperatures (around 150°C), along with wide processing windows (up to 150°C). Remarkably, an “Ene” reaction between cyano and allyl groups was identified, leading to imine formation in the early stage of curing below 200°C. Meanwhile, the traditional cyano polymerization mechanism also operates under elevated curing temperature, generating azaisoindoline, azaphthalocyanine, and triazine structures. The resin cured at 275°C shows high thermal stability (T g = 346.8°C, char yield = 75.8%), and superior flame‐retardance performance (HRC = 18.1 J g −1 K −1 , THR = 1.6 kJ g −1 ).

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Recent advances in proteomic profiling have enabled its use as a powerful approach in elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease, enabling the identification of disease‐associated protein alterations and candidate biomarkers for diagnosis, progression, and therapeutic response. Objectives The Accelerating Medicines Partnership® Parkinson's Disease (AMP PD) program is a public–private partnership between the National Institutes of Health (NIH), multiple biopharmaceutical and life sciences companies, and non‐profit organizations, managed by the Foundation for National Institutes of Health (FNIH). The program aims to advance the molecular and clinical characterization of PD through deep, longitudinal profiling of patient data and biosamples, with the goal of identifying and validating diagnostic, prognostic, and progression biomarkers for PD. Methods Longitudinal proteomic profiling, both targeted and untargeted, was performed on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples. The resulting datasets are publicly accessible via the AMP® PD Knowledge Platform. Results The proteomic datasets enable differential protein analyses and can be used to explore molecular alterations associated with PD progression and heterogeneity. Conclusions These studies contribute to the broader AMP PD initiative by providing the research community with a harmonized proteomics dataset. As part of the larger AMP PD data, this work provides the PD community with a harmonized and accessible proteomics dataset that can be utilized for discovery, hypothesis generation, and validation of users’ own research. © 2026 Technome.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Ground deformation induced by pore‐pressure dissipation poses significant challenges for geotechnical stability, yet traditional numerical solvers for Biot's consolidation often suffer from high computational cost and poor convergence, while standard PINNs struggle with gradient competition, inadequate spatial correlation modeling, and insufficient high‐order derivative accuracy. To address these limitations, this study proposes AGM‐PINNs, a novel framework that integrates a graph‐attention‐based spatiotemporal alignment module, an adaptive wavelet activation function (AWAF), and a mixture‐of‐experts (MoE) optimizer to efficiently solve three‐dimensional Biot's consolidation problems. The graph attention mechanism dynamically focuses on high‐gradient regions such as seepage fronts and stress concentration zones; AWAF enhances numerical smoothness and derivative fidelity; and MoE adaptively balances the multiphysics residuals to mitigate gradient competition. Extensive numerical experiments, including 1D, 2D, and 3D benchmarks, demonstrate that AGM‐PINNs achieve training losses on the order of , reduce displacement prediction errors from 8.954 mm in standard PINNs to 0.205 mm, and accurately infer permeability parameters with an average absolute error of . These results highlight the framework's robustness, high accuracy, and strong applicability to complex, multiscale hydro‐mechanical coupling problems, offering a reliable and mesh‐free computational tool for practical geotechnical engineering.",

    "Abstract": "In alpine ecosystems, cushion plants often facilitate the growth and survival of other plants by ameliorating harsh abiotic conditions. However, our knowledge of these interactions is largely derived from studies conducted across a narrow range of environmental contexts, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere. The few studies that have been conducted in other contexts have found either no facilitation provided by cushions or that their interspecific interactions are highly variable. This study evaluates the role of the cushion plant Raoulia albosericea in facilitating other plant species in the unique environment along the eastern slope of Mt. Ruapehu, North Island, New Zealand. The region's arid conditions and unstable volcanic sands provide an opportunity to assess how these abiotic factors influence cushion species interactions. At both high and low elevations we tested 1) whether the presence of R. albosericea altered soil temperature and compaction under its canopy; 2) whether overall plant density and cover differed between cushion and noncushion environments; and 3) whether plant species were preferentially spatially associated within R. albosericea canopies compared to open ground. The presence of R. albosericea lowered soil temperature and increased soil compaction. Overall plant density and cover were significantly greater within R. albosericea canopies than in adjacent open areas. These effects were more pronounced at the high elevation site compared to the low elevation site. In addition, 10 of the 14 species we encountered in our surveys were significantly associated with R. albosericea . These findings suggest that R. albosericea facilitates the growth and establishment of several species on Mt. Ruapehu. This study contributes to our understanding of how facilitation varies across different environmental contexts, and it suggests that cushion plants could play a role in influencing diversity patterns in this unique alpine environment.",

To enhance and supplement existing knowledge of saprophytic fungi associated with Fabaceae hosts, this study collected three Acrocalymma specimens from three Fabaceae plants. Three Acrocalymma specimens were identified as one novel species and two known species by using morphological comparisons and phylogenetic analyses of multi‐loci (internal transcribed spacer region of the nrDNA, translation elongation factor 1‐alpha, small subunit nuclear rRNA gene and part of the large subunit nuclear rRNA gene) sequence data. Phylogenetic analysis showed one collection from our study, as a novel species, Acrocalymma cercidis sp. nov. Acrocalymma cercidis differs from its closely related taxa by the shape, size and septation of the conidia. In addition, A. chuxiongense and A. arenga are described from their anamorph for the first time. Senna pendula and Dalbergia hupeana are reported as new host records for A. chuxiongense and A. arenga , respectively. Based on a systematic study of specimens collected from China, this research describes and identifies a new species of Acrocalymma , thereby extending the known species diversity of this genus. Notably, this study clarifies the connection between the teleomorph and anamorph stages of two known species. In summary, the present study expands and contributes to the species diversity in Acrocalymma and life cycle in China.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective While prior work has related pregravid or childhood excess weight to brain outcomes in children, their combined associations remain unclear. We examined these relationships in 6‐year‐old children. Methods Ninety‐nine mother–child pairs (60% girls) were classified into four groups based on pregravid BMI (&lt; 25 vs. ≥ 25 kg/m 2 ) and child BMI (&lt; 85th and ≥ 85th percentile). T1‐weighted MRI assessed cortical thickness, sulcal depth, gyrification, and subcortical volumes in children. ANCOVA revealed group differences controlling age, sex, parental education, and birth weight (and total intracranial volume in non‐thickness models). Bonferroni‐adjusted post hoc tests followed omnibus tests. Results High pregravid BMI was associated with a thicker right superior temporal gyrus, while high child BMI was linked to greater gyrification in temporo‐cingulate cortices. Both maternal and child higher BMI were related to a thinner right cuneus and a smaller right accumbens and pallidum. Children with higher BMI born to mothers with higher BMI showed deeper sulci in the left caudal middle frontal gyrus and reduced gyrification in the left entorhinal cortex. Conclusions Higher BMI in both children and mothers, separately and jointly, was associated with gray matter differences in obesity‐related regions. Longitudinal studies are needed to establish temporal relationships, mechanisms, biomarkers, and functional implications.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) play a crucial role in search and rescue (SAR) operations, surveillance, amongst others, but their deployment in adverse weather conditions, mainly high‐winds, remains a challenge. The proposed hybrid control system serves as a step toward more robust and intelligent UAV solutions capable of operating in extreme weather conditions. The advent of artificial intelligence has encouraged the move towards the development of adaptive systems, which rely on static datasets and limited generalization in complex environments, encouraging the shift towards dynamic, real‐time learning methods. This paper presents a hybrid control strategy for enhancing UAV stability in strong wind conditions by integrating Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning. The proposed approach is implemented on the Field‐based Autonomous LiDAR Control for Obstacle Navigation (FALCON) Digital Twin, developed at Ulster University, enabling simulation and testing of wind disturbances as faults. The performance and complexity analysis of the strategies indicates that the proposed DDPG to LQR‐PSO controller (HyLPD) offers superior stability, effectively mitigating wind‐induced deviations while maintaining manageable computational complexity. Results show that while LQR‐PSO achieves a 40% performance improvement with a low computational cost, the HyLPD method further enhances system robustness, reducing overshoot and improving settling times under turbulent conditions without extensively labeled data. However, the increased computational demand of hybrid controllers suggests a trade‐off between adaptability and real‐time feasibility for UAV deployment. This study highlights the importance of hybrid control frameworks in UAV applications, particularly for SAR, where resilience to environmental disturbances is critical.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can cause a range of immune‐related adverse events (irAEs), including rare neuropsychiatric complications. However, these events often present with diverse and non‐specific symptoms, making diagnosis difficult. Case Presentation A 64‐year‐old man with Stage IV gastric cancer receiving nivolumab developed impaired consciousness, delusions, and dissociative behavior, and reduced instrumental activities of daily living during and after ICI therapy. During chemotherapy, the patient was suspected of having dementia and was referred to a psychiatrist. However, the possibility of irAE was not mentioned at that time. Despite normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid findings, a multidisciplinary assessment due to clinical features and exclusion of other etiologies led to the clinical suspicion of an immune‐related encephalopathy. Steroid pulse therapy and antipsychotics (risperidone, later olanzapine) improved symptoms. Psychiatric relapse occurred after discontinuing risperidone and resolved with olanzapine. Conclusion In patients undergoing ICI therapy, new‐onset psychiatric symptoms should raise suspicion for irAEs. Timely multidisciplinary intervention is essential for accurate diagnosis and effective symptom management.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Developing ultrathin yet mechanically robust polymer electrolytes remain a key challenge for enabling practical solid‐state lithium batteries. Here, we report a scalable engineering strategy to construct an ultrathin (~19 μm) composite polymer electrolyte (PPLS) by integrating a macroporous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) scaffold with an in situ formed silica (SiO 2 ) nanonetwork within a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) matrix. The PTFE framework provides macroscopic dimensional stability and mechanical reinforcement, while the SiO 2 network, generated via a controlled in situ hydrolysis process, effectively reduces polymer crystallinity and enhances ionic transport. The resulting PPLS membrane exhibits a tensile strength of approximately 75 MPa, an ionic conductivity of 1.6 × 10 −4 S cm −1 at 60°C, and a Li + transference number of 0.60. This electrolyte enables stable L//Li cycling for more than 700 h and demonstrates excellent rate capability in both LiFePO 4 and NCM523 full cells. The hierarchical PTFE/SiO 2 architecture exemplifies how rational multi‐scale design can simultaneously achieve structural robustness and efficient ionic mobility, providing a promising and scalable pathway for the development of high‐performance polymer composites for energy storage applications.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) equipped with multispectral and RGB sensors offer valuable data for monitoring crop health and assessing disease severity. However, the wide range of available photogrammetric software complicates software selection for high‐throughput plant phenotyping. This study compares the consistency of three widely used software packages, OpenDroneMap (ODM), Agisoft Metashape, and Pix4Dmapper in processing UAS‐acquired imagery for wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) phenotyping. Over two seasons at Oklahoma State University research sites, imagery from a DJI Phantom 4 Pro Multispectral was used to generate eight vegetation indices (VIs), which were evaluated using correlation () and root mean square error (RMSE). Normalized VIs showed strong consistency across software, with values between 0.85 and 0.99 and RMSEs ranging from 0.004 to 0.07. Non‐normalized indices exhibited greater variability but retained high correlations ( &gt; 0.76). Ground‐truth validation used single‐view imagery and disease severity ratings. Bayesian models quantified spectral measurement differences, their distributions (mean, standard deviation, skewness, and excess kurtosis) across processing approaches, and evaluated disease classification performance using ordinal logistic regression. Normalized VIs were highly consistent across software (posterior median differences &lt;0.01 units, overlapping 95% highest density intervals), while single‐view imagery showed 15%–25% higher pixel‐level variability than software outputs. Non‐normalized indices showed greater processing sensitivity. RGB indices demonstrated near to perfect consistency. Disease classification accuracy ranged from 35% to 48% with minimal software differences (&lt;2%). All three software produce biologically consistent results, ensuring stable genotype rankings regardless of processing choice. ODM performed comparably to proprietary alternatives while offering cost‐effectiveness, transparency, and reproducibility advantages.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Various small‐scale experiments were performed to provide data for developing a model to predict the thermal response of LLM‐105 over a wide range of conditions. The thermal decomposition of LLM‐105 was studied as a function of sample mass, confinement of volatile products, and preheating time in both isothermal and ramped heating experiments. The thermal decomposition of LLM‐105 is a two‐step process, as shown by the two exothermic peaks in the heat flow profiles, which were fitted to two nth‐order autocatalytic reaction models with a similar activation energy of ∼289 kJ/mol. The magnitude and shape of these peaks varied with sample mass and confinement. Increasing sample mass enhanced the second exotherm with respect to the first one, while increasing the level of confinement promoted a transition from a sublimation‐dominated regime towards thermal decomposition. The effect of LLM‐105 particle size on the rate of weight loss was evident for open‐pan experiments, where bigger particles sublimed at lower temperatures than smaller particles. Thermal response and solid residue composition of LLM‐105 samples were analyzed following preheating for different durations. Longer preheating times caused a shift of the second exotherm to lower temperatures and a decrease in the reaction enthalpy, confirming that LLM‐105 decay is a consecutive reaction mechanism, probably autocatalytic. The kinetic model derived from ramped experiments was validated against the measured LLM‐105 fraction remaining and the enthalpy remaining of the solid residue as a function of preheating times and showed good agreement.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND With increasing resistance to traditional fungicides and growing environmental concerns, it is crucial to develop novel succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors to enhance disease management and support sustainable agriculture. RESULTS This study systematically designed and synthesized a series of nicotinohydrazides bearing a biphenyl fragment, evaluating their antifungal activity against six plant pathogenic fungi. The results demonstrated that their fungicidal spectrum significantly surpasses boscalid and carbendazim. Utilizing a palladium‐catalyzed cross‐coupling strategy, combined with diazotization‐reduction and dehydration condensation reactions, we successfully synthesized 35 target compounds ( F1 – F18 , G1 – G17 ). Antifungal assays revealed that most compounds exhibited more than 80% inhibition against the tested fungi at a concentration of 20 mg/L, particularly compound F17 , which showed a half‐maximal effective concentrations value ranging from 0.33 to 2.77 mg/L and achieved an efficacy of 89.94% against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum on canola leaves at a concentration of 200 mg/L. Mechanistic investigations indicated that F17 exerts its antifungal effects through multiple mechanisms, including the inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase, disruption of cell membranes and induction of oxidative damage. Toxicity predictions and cytotoxicity assays assessed the safety of this series of compounds. Density functional theory and molecular electrostatic potential analyses elucidated the reasons for the high activity of F17 . CONCLUSION Nicotinohydrazide derivatives exhibit a broader spectrum of antifungal activity than traditional inhibitors, and their multiple mechanisms of action provide a theoretical basis for further structural optimization and the design of novel agrochemicals. © 2026 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT High‐income countries shape their migration policies to attract highly qualified immigrants (HQI), aiming to boost human capital and economic growth. HQI often settle in large cities, raising two challenges for urban social sustainability. First, immigrants frequently face residential segregation, hindering social integration. Second, local communities in cities receiving wealthier migrants may experience displacement due to lifestyle migration and transnational gentrification. However, in countries with recent migration history, the residential distribution of HQI in urban areas remains largely unknown. This study analyses the residential distribution of HQI in Spain's largest urban areas, where HQI have rapidly increased from nearly 170,000 in 2001 to over 925,000 in 2021. Using 2021 Census data, we apply Multilevel Latent Class Analysis to categorize immigrants by migration status, labour performance and household characteristics. We identify seven distinct groups and demonstrate the existence of a socioeconomic stratification regarding their residential distribution. Unemployed or overqualified HQIs from low‐ and middle‐income regions cluster in lower‐income peripheral areas, while those employed in high‐skilled jobs originating in Europe concentrate in central cities.",

    "Abstract": "The utilization of crystal structures has been recognized as a powerful strategy for enhancing photo‐ and electrocatalytic performance that often stems from the existence of different polymorphic forms or variations in elemental stoichiometry. Both factors govern the electronic and surface properties, which in turn influence the material's catalytic behavior. The first part of the discussion explores polymorphism in nanostructures. The existence of multiple polymorphic forms can lead to substantial variations in catalytic reactivity, making it essential to understand their effects on efficiency in order to enable the rational selection and targeted design of materials for specific catalytic reactions. The review shifts the focus to stoichiometry, leading to the formation of distinct crystal structures and showing how these structural variations correlate with catalytic activity. By altering the ratio of elements within a compound, it is possible to stabilize different crystal phases, each exhibiting unique surface properties and active sites that impact their performance in catalytic reactions. To support these discussions, several case studies are presented highlighting these aspects. Through this comprehensive overview, the review aims to provide perspectives into the structure–activity relationship and demonstrate the potential of crystal structure as a guiding principle for the future design of efficient catalytic materials.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background ALDH1A3 is a key factor associated with tumor stemness and chemotherapy resistance, making it a promising therapeutic target. Screening various compounds with potential inhibition of cancer stem cells led to the discovery of a naturally occurring Dioscin as a novel ALDH1A3 inhibitor. However, the precise mechanism underlying its action remains unexplored. Experimental Procedure Immunohistochemical analysis of 90 ovarian serous tumor samples revealed the clinical significance of ALDH1A3 in tumor progression. TCGA data was used to identify genes highly correlated with ALDH1A3 in ovarian cancer. Using CRISPR/Cas9‐generated ALDH1A3 knockout (KO) cell lines, we investigated its oncogenic influence in ovarian and gastric cancers. The anti‐tumor effects of Dioscin were assessed through MTT, scratch, and 3D spheroid formation assays. In vivo efficacy of Dioscin was assessed using a xenograft mouse model. Mechanistic investigations of Dioscin with ALDH1A3 were predicted by molecular docking and assessed through ALDH1A3 enzymatic activity and retinoic acid (RA) metabolism analyses. Results ALDH1A3 expression correlates with early‐stage ovarian cancer progression. Genetic ablation of ALDH1A3 significantly suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and stemness properties. ALDH1A3 is significantly associated with ECM‐related genes in ovarian cancer. Dioscin exhibited an ALDH1A3‐dependent anti‐tumor effect by inhibiting ALDH1A3 enzymatic activity, disrupting RA metabolism, and downregulating the expression of stemness‐ and migration‐associated proteins (CD44 and MMP2). Furthermore, Dioscin effectively delays tumor growth without obvious signs of toxicity. Conclusion Our study provides the first evidence that Dioscin inhibits ALDH1A3‐mediated RA metabolism and cancer stemness. Our data will further support its potential as a therapeutic agent for cancer treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The water‐vapour‐sensitive channels of infrared imager instruments on board geostationary satellite instruments, such as the spinning enhanced visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI), deliver valuable information on humidity and clouds in the upper and mid‐level troposphere. In past decades it was common practice to assimilate these channels in clear‐sky only, due to a number of challenges of the all‐sky assimilation, such as the forward modelling (i.e., the computation of the model‐equivalent brightness temperatures) of cloudy scenes. In recent years, however, more efforts have been taken by research institutions and weather services to overcome these challenges. In this article we describe which steps were necessary to assimilate the two water‐vapour‐sensitive channels of Meteosat‐SEVIRI at 6.2 and 7.3 m in our convective‐scale regional forecasting system ICON‐D2 at the German Weather Service within a local ensemble transform Kalman filter framework in all‐sky conditions with positive forecast impact. After finding an optimal set‐up how to use these channels in combination with the already operationally assimilated visible channel at 0.6 m including vertical height assignment and localization, observation error modelling and data reduction, a clear positive impact is achieved. Upper air moisture, the cloud cover of high and mid‐level clouds, and thereby also direct and diffuse radiation at the surface and the 2‐m temperatures and humidity verified against SYNOP stations is improved in forecasts for more than 24 hr.",

Examining the paired differences using control schemes facilitates the early detection of changes in the process dispersion parameter, ensuring consistent process improvement. This work introduces various novel control strategies, including the Shewhart control schemes and the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) schemes. These schemes are specifically designed to monitor the increase in the dispersion parameter of paired differences in quality characteristics. For the assessment of the suggested control schemes, the run‐length metric is used, which is generated by creating an algorithm in the R language. The performance of the developed control schemes is compared with some well‐known existing schemes. From the numerical results, it is concluded that the proposed schemes are more powerful in detecting the changes in the understudy process dispersion parameter than their counterparts. Two practical applications related to the healthcare sector and chemical engineering are also provided to implement the proposed scheme in a real‐world system.",

The scheme integrates reinforcement learning (RL) and data‐driven model predictive control (DD‐MPC) through value iteration. Also, a value function approximation technique is applied to approximate the terminal cost, thereby providing a direct method based on behavioral systems theory, thus using historical operation data to bypass the system identification step. The scheme first operates offline to derive the optimal approximated value function, and then operates online for controller design. Furthermore, the proposed DD‐RLMPC scheme offers flexibility in selecting the prediction horizon, thus provides a potential to significantly reduce the computational burden compared to the terminal equality‐constrained DD‐MPC methods. We demonstrate the convergence, stability, and feasibility of the proposed DD‐RLMPC scheme, with properties verified by simulation results.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In this paper, we present a finite‐time sliding mode control method for trajectory tracking control of uncertain robotic systems. First, to dispel the conflict between high convergence speed and reduced chattering in sliding mode control (SMC), a novel exponential‐like reaching law (ELRL) is designed by imposing dual prescribed performance on the tracking error and the sliding mode variable, respectively. The proposed ELRL replaces the sign function with an exponential‐like term. By doing so, the system state can be accelerated faster to the sliding mode surface within prescribed transient and steady‐state performance, while mitigating chattering. Second, to approximate and compensate for model parameter uncertainties and strong external disturbances, an unknown system dynamic estimator (USDE) adopting first order filter technique is presented to estimate lumped disturbance. Then, by incorporating the USDE into the SMC, a finite‐time sliding mode control method is developed for robotic systems. Its semi‐globally practically finite‐time stability is strictly proved via Lyapunov theory. Finally, comparative experiments are conducted on a simulated robotic system, illustrating faster convergence speed, stronger robustness, and greater chattering mitigation of the proposed method.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT At the operating temperature (∼750°C) of solid oxide cells (SOCs), Ni diffusion has been revealed to cause aging degradations on catalytic performance, electronic conductivity, and mechanical failures. This work discloses that Ni diffusion during the high‐temperature (∼1400°C) SOC fabrication process can severely decrease the oxide ion conductivity due to Ni segregation (up to ∼7 at.%) at the YSZ (yttria‐stabilized zirconia) grain boundaries (GBs). Combining electrochemical tests and advanced electron microscopy, we reveal that higher Ni enrichment leads to thicker space charge layer and higher space charge potential, which generates a significant GB blocking effect for oxide ion diffusion. We have quantitatively estimated the ionic conductivity drop induced by Ni segregation at the operation temperature range. Utilizing the ultrafast high‐temperature sintering technique, we successfully mitigate Ni segregation at GBs, which can double the ionic conductivity at 700°C. This work not only clarifies that Ni segregation at YSZ GBs can significantly plague the ionic conductivity but also demonstrates that mitigating Ni segregation at YSZ GBs is a new avenue to reduce the cell's ohmic resistance and boost the SOC performance.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Advanced supramolecular assemblies with predefined lifetimes and rapid responses to stimuli are in high demand for applications such as biomedical delivery systems. However, such assemblies are rarely able to respond rapidly and completely to stimuli, with predictable changes in morphology. Here, we introduce monodisperse self‐immolative Janus dendrimers (SIJDs) composed of hydrophilic oligo(ethylene glycol)‐functionalized phenolic acid dendrons and hydrophobic monodisperse oligo(ethyl glyoxylate) chains having light‐responsive end‐groups. These SIJDs self‐assemble into spherical nanoparticles in aqueous media. Upon ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation, the hydrophobic oligo(ethyl glyoxylate) units exhibit rapid end‐to‐end self‐immolation within minutes. The depolymerization at the molecular level leads to a degradation pathway from spherical to crescent‐shaped nanoparticles, which can be used for the rapid release of encapsulated molecules of interest.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Potassium‐ion batteries (PIBs) have emerged as a promising next‐generation energy storage technology due to the abundance of potassium resources, low redox potential of K + /K, and compatibility with aluminum current collectors. Graphite, as a cost‐effective and structurally stable anode, exhibits considerable potential for practical PIB applications. However, challenges such as sluggish K + diffusion kinetics, significant volume expansion, and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) hinder the full utilization of the graphite anode. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in understanding the K + intercalation behavior and storage mechanism of graphite. Key strategies for enhancing graphite performance, including interlayer spacing regulation, morphological engineering, defect and heteroatom doping, and coating design, are thoroughly discussed. In addition, interface engineering approaches involving electrolyte component optimization, artificial SEI construction, and binder design are highlighted to address SEI instability. This review also compares the potassium storage characteristics of graphite with those in lithium/sodium systems and outlines current challenges under extreme conditions. Finally, future perspectives are provided to guide the rational design of graphite‐based anodes for high‐performance PIBs. This work aims to offer a comprehensive reference for the development of advanced graphite anode materials in emerging potassium‐ion battery technologies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Thermoelectric materials enable the conversion of heat into electricity with no waste heat. Nanotwined AgMnGePbSbTe 5 , a novel P‐type narrow bandgap high‐entropy semiconductor, exhibits enhanced thermoelectric performance upon the introduction of Pb vacancies. With increasing Pb vacancy content, the hole concentration rose monotonically, dramatically augmenting the electrical conductivity, thus enhancing the power factor. The DFT calculation indicates that electron band convergence herein improves the density of states effective mass, hence stabilizing the Seebeck coefficient. On the other hand, as the vacancies promote the point defect scattering, the lattice thermal conductivity is suppressed as well. Consequently, the synergistic effects on both electrical and thermal transport led to a peak ZT of 2.23 at 723 K and an average ZT of 1.31 across the temperature range of 303–813 K for AgMnGePb 0.97 SbTe 5 , representing improvements of 31% and 34% over the initial sample, respectively. This material creates a competitive thermoelectric performance among the Te‐based thermoelectric materials, establishing a promising optimization strategy utilizing vacancy engineering.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract As the demand for sustainable materials increases, there is a significant necessity to consider the re‐utilization of plastic waste, especially polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in construction. This study examines the flexural behavior of the PET‐modified concrete beam reinforced with glass‐fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bars. The primary objective is to evaluate the combined effect of PET content and reinforcement type (GFRP and steel) on the flexural behavior of the beam. The compressive strength of PET‐modified concrete was 17.68%, 13.61%, and 15.26% higher than M20, M25, and M30 grade conventional concrete (CC) mix at 28 days. Similarly, the split tensile strength and bond strength was also higher than CC mix at 28 days. It was found that the concrete modified with 12.5% PET granules were optimum for enhancing the mechanical properties of concrete. The M20, M25, and M30 grade PET modified concrete beam reinforced with GFRP showed a 23.1%, 22.2%, and 17.2% increase in load‐bearing capacity compared to the PET modified concrete beam reinforced with steel bars. Moreover, the PET modified concrete beams of grades M20, M25, and M30 reinforced with GFRP showed deflection capacities that were 189%, 214%, and 183% higher compared to the PET modified concrete beam reinforced with steel bars. The findings conclude the potential of PET‐GFRP systems to deliver sustainable and mechanically superior alternatives to conventional reinforced concrete.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Cheilocostus speciosus is a well‐known medicinal rhizome, particularly in India and the Arabian countries, used as a folk medicine. Although the resources of this plant are vibrant in Vietnam, scientific data on its chemical composition and bioactivities remain limited. In this study, extracts of n ‐hexane, ethyl acetate, and n ‐butanol were prepared from the rhizomes of C. speciosus growing in Vietnam. Their α‐glucosidase inhibitory activity was evaluated to select the most promising fraction for further investigation of its chemical composition. The obtained results showed that the n ‐hexane extract exhibited the highest α‐glucosidase inhibitory capacity among extracts (IC 50 = 34.35 µg mL −1 ), being stronger than acarbose (IC 50 = 122.20 mM). From this extract, six compounds were isolated, namely diosgenin ( 1 ), pennogenin ( 2 ), diosgenone ( 3 ), diosbulbisin A ( 4 ), isonuatigenone ( 5 ), and (22β,25R)‐7‐oxo‐spirosta‐3,5‐diene ( 6 ). Their molecular structure was elucidated using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and high‐resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, along with comparison to reference data. Among these compounds, compound 6 has not been previously reported as a natural phytocomponent. Such achievements confirmed the medicinal value of Vietnamese C. speciosus and significantly expanded scientific knowledge of its phytochemistry and bioactivity.",

    "Abstract": "A bstract We investigate the interior of AdS black holes under finite shear strain in a class of holographic axion models, which are widely used to describe strongly-coupled systems with broken translations. We demonstrate that the shear anisotropy necessarily eliminates the inner Cauchy horizon, such that the deformed black hole approaches a spacelike singularity. The anisotropic effect induced by the axion fields triggers a collapse of the Einstein-Rosen bridge at the would-be Cauchy horizon, accompanied by a rapid change in the anisotropy of the spatial geometry. In addition, for a power-law axion potential, sufficiently large shear deformations give rise to a domain wall solution that includes a Lifshitz like scaling geometry near the boundary as well as a near horizon Kasner epoch with the Kasner exponents determined by the powers of the potential. Finally, we find that the interior dynamics of black holes generally enter an era described by an anisotropic Kasner universe at later interior time. Depending on the form of the potential, they either tend to stable Kasner universes, or exhibit an endless alternation of different Kasner epochs toward the singularity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper initiates the study of the Einstein equation on homogeneous supermanifolds. First, we produce explicit curvature formulas for graded Riemannian metrics on these spaces. Next, we present a construction of homogeneous supermanifolds by means of Dynkin diagrams, resembling the construction of generalised flag manifolds in classical (non-super) theory. We describe the Einstein metrics on several classes of spaces obtained through this approach. Our results provide examples of compact homogeneous supermanifolds on which the Einstein equation has no solutions, discrete families of solutions, and continuous families of Ricci-flat solutions among invariant metrics. These examples demonstrate that the finiteness conjecture from classical homogeneous geometry fails on supermanifolds, and challenge the intuition furnished by Bochner’s vanishing theorem.",

Materials and methods In this secondary analysis of a prospective trial, patients with stage I-III lung cancer who underwent [ 18 F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI and CE-CT or [ 18 F]FDG PET/CT scans within 2 weeks were selected. Gross tumor volume (GTV), clinical tumor volume (CTV), and planning tumor volume (PTV) were drawn for the primary tumor (GTVp) and involved lymph nodes (GTVnd) based on CE-CT, [ 18 F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI PET/CT and [ 18 F]FDG PET/CT. Organs at risk were evaluated and compared in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) plans. Results Fifty-one patients (median age, 64 years; 38 males [74.5%]) were evaluated. Statistically significant differences in GTVs based on CE-CT, [ 18 F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI PET/CT, and [ 18 F]FDG PET/CT were found between each pair (all P &lt; 0.05), except that no difference in GTVp was found between [ 18 F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI and [ 18 F]FDG PET/CT ( P = 0.558). CE-CT-based GTVp values were significantly larger than those based on [ 18 F]FDG PET/CT and [ 18 F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI PET/CT due to the presence of obstructive pneumonia ( n = 18; all P &lt; 0.05). PTVall-IMRT based on CE-CT (351.98 ± 26.87) was significantly larger than that based on [ 18 F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI PET/CT (329.98 ± 26.21; P = 0.03). PTVall-IMPT based on CE-CT (212.74 ± 18.73) was significantly larger than those based on [ 18 F]FDG PET/CT (204.26 ± 19.34) and [ 18 F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI PET/CT (196.99 ± 18.38), with P -values of 0.046 and 0.011, respectively. For IMRT, [ 18 F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI PET/CT-based plans significantly reduced the radiation doses received by the heart, contralateral lung, and both lungs (all P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion [ 18 F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI PET/CT shows promise as a valuable tool for radiotherapy planning in lung cancer, providing accurate target delineation and improved sparing of critical organs.

Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are established treatment options. Neurological complications such as subclinical cerebral ischemia, delirium, and postoperative cognitive decline can occur during either treatment; however, precise data on neurological impairment remain scarce. Objectives The aim of this study was to compare neurological outcomes of patients undergoing TAVI or SAVR. Methods COSTA (Cognitive Outcome after Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic valve replacement) is a single-center sub-study of the randomized DEDICATE trial (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT04535076). Neurocognitive tests (memory, attention, language, executive functions), questionnaires on neuropsychology (cognitive failures questionnaire [CFQ], hospital anxiety, and depression scale [HADS]), and health-related quality of life (SF-36) were used before intervention and 3 months thereafter. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out post-intervention. In addition, there was a systematic assessment of delirium during the hospital stay. Results The study cohort (mean age 71.8 years, 32% female) consisted of SAVR ( n = 13) and TAVI ( n = 18) patients. In the SAVR group, subsyndromal delirium was more common (54 vs. 11%, p = 0.017; OR = 8.58), visual recognition ability was worse (mean difference (MD) = − 0.6 vs. + 0.3, p = 0.036, η 2 = 0.14), and emotional impairment was numerically more declined (MD = − 36.8 vs. − 4.7, p = 0.058, η 2 = 0.12) when compared to the TAVI group. Conclusion In this small, exploratory sample, SAVR showed a trend toward less favorable neuropsychological outcomes compared with TAVI in patients with low-to-intermediate surgical risk.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Among the released radionuclides from nuclear power plants and radioactive waste repositories, 14 C is of great importance. Continuous discharges of 14 C from nuclear industries, the risk of uncontrolled releases, and possible leaking from facilities may cause a threat to the biosphere. Because of high mobility and a long half-life of 14 C, it has great potential to be released into aquatic ecosystems and to be assimilated by aquatic plants. However, the amount of 14 C incorporated into organic matter and hydrophytes is largely unknown. In this study, the uptake of carbon from sediment into aquatic plants was investigated in a microcosm experiment. The study was carried out based on the natural difference in the isotopic signature of 14 C between the 8000-year-old peat and more enriched sources (water and atmosphere). The two-pool isotope mixing model was applied to determine the relative contribution of each source (sediment vs. air/water) to the hydrophytes. The results indicated the highest contribution of sediment-derived carbon to the free-floating Lemna minor (up to 60%), followed by submerged Littorella uniflora (15–17%) and the emergent species, Stachys palustris and Lysimachia nummularia (up to 10%). Despite the contribution of sediment-derived C to their C source, the hydrophytes incorporated less than 2% of their total C from sediment. The results also indicated the importance of floating plants in more efficient uptake of sediment-derived C available in water column or the air. Furthermore, no significant difference was found in the transfer of sediment-derived C between the roots and the leaves within the species.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose A German transplant center recently published a prognostic model predicting graft function one year after deceased donor kidney transplantation (KTx) relying on pre-transplant variables. The aim of this study is to externally validate this model. Methods We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from deceased donor KTx recipients undergoing transplantation between January 2007 and December 2023 at University Hospital Rheinisch-Westfälische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were analyzed to validate the prognostic model based on donor age, donor serum creatinine, recipient body mass index, re-transplantation &gt; 2nd KTx, and cold ischemia time. Glomerular filtration rates were categorized using the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) categories G1 – G5. Results A total of 494 kidney transplantations were performed at our institution, 350 (70.9%) thereof from donation after brain death. The median one-year estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 42 [12–94] mL/min/1.73 m 2 . A validation for all eGFR categories was only possible with recalibration of the constant and coefficients of the original model, whereas without recalibration it could only be validated for KDIGO G2 and G4. Unfavourable recipient/donor-pairings with eGFR categories G4 and G5 one year after KTx could be predicted with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) &gt; 0.700 in the validation and the original study cohort. Conclusion We successfully validated the prognostic model for prediction of eGFR categories G4 and G5, which is of high clinical importance to identify outcomes with marginal graft function one year after KTx, thereby facilitating the avoidance of futile recipient/donor-pairings during allocation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Main conclusion These results highlight irradiated Ch-NPs as a promising, eco-friendly, and sustainable component of integrated disease management strategies, offering a viable alternative to conventional chemical fungicides for controlling Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. sesami in sesame cultivation. Fusarium wilt, caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. sesami , poses a major limitation to sesame productivity. To develop a more efficient control approach, chitosan nanoparticles (Ch-NPs) were synthesized and exposed to 24 kGy of gamma irradiation, a process that improves their structural uniformity and enhances their functional properties. The antifungal activity was tested under laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions, either alone or in combination with Trichoderma reesei , Bacillus subtilis , and the commercial fungicide Maxim-XL. The nanoparticles were characterized using UV, FTIR, and TEM analysis. UV analysis confirmed the nanoparticle spectrum with a maximum absorbance at 224 nm. Using transmission electron microscopy, it was found that by gamma irradiation, Ch-NP size was reduced from 89.08–113.63 nm to 48.11–56.22 nm, which, in turn, made it more uniform and bioactive. Irradiated Ch-NPs (250 µL L⁻ 1 ) demonstrated the ability of almost complete inhibition of F. oxysporum growth in vitro, along with controlling the disease incidence and severity in greenhouse and field tests, which is equal to that of Maxim-XL. Among the biological agents tried, T. reesei was the best in giving an antagonism of 76.3% inhibition. Treatment with irradiated Ch-NPs and T. reesei enhanced sesame growth and productivity, reflected in greater plant height, more capsules, and higher seed yield, and also elevated the activities of defense-related enzymes—peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, chitinase, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. The study therefore sought to assess the effectiveness of gamma-irradiated chitosan nanoparticles, used in combination with biological control agents, as eco-friendly alternatives to chemical fungicides for managing the disease.",

    "Abstract": "Summary Introduction Chronic hepatitis D (CHD) is a severe viral hepatitis characterized by a rapid progression towards advanced chronic liver disease (ACLD). This study aimed to characterize the Austrian CHD epidemiology with respect to disease severity, systemic inflammation and genetic markers. Methods Patients attending one of six participating hospitals from 2020 onwards were included and assessed regarding laboratory data, liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and biopsy, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement, endoscopy and imaging. In a subset, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes of interest (IL28B, PNPLA3, SERPINA1, NTCP) were assessed. Biomarkers of liver disease severity were compared to an age-matched cohort of treatment-eligible and treatment-naïve chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients. Results A total of 59 CHD patients (median age: 44.0 years, 59.3% male) were included and ACLD was found in 62.7%. Decompensated patients exhibited higher levels of biomarkers of systemic inflammation, such as C‑reactive protein ( p = 0.061) and interleukin 6 ( p = 0.008). The SNP IL28B C/C genotype had an unfavorable effect on disease severity (higher Model for End-Stage Liver Disease [MELD] score, HVPG and ammonia levels, lower platelet counts and albumin levels, all p &lt; 0.05). The CHD patients showed a more severe liver disease compared to CHB mono-infected patients with respect to LSM, platelets, MELD and portal hypertension (all p &lt; 0.01). Conclusion This analysis of the Austrian CHD cohort before initiation of antiviral treatment showed a high burden of ACLD and portal hypertension, especially when compared to CHB patients. The IL28B C/C SNP was associated with a more severe liver disease in CHD.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose In June 2024, a genomic cluster of seven Salmonella Typhimurium - sequence type 19, and cluster type 21092 - was detected in Norway, triggering a national outbreak investigation. Methods Information about new cases was collected from the Norwegian Surveillance System for Communicable Diseases and the database at the National Reference Laboratory for Enteropathogenic Bacteria (NRL) at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH). Microbiological analyses were conducted by NRL at NIPH for human samples and at the Norwegian Veterinary Institute for animal samples. Epidemiological data was collected through interviews. International notification was sent via EpiPulse. Results Eleven cases in total, sampled between March 6 and July 11, 2024, were identified across Norway. The median age of affected individuals was three years. Notably, 73% of the cases reported prior contact with cats or passerine birds. The outbreak strain was also detected in a faecal sample from a cat belonging to one of the affected households, suggesting an animal source. Concurrently, Finland and Sweden reported five and six cases, respectively, involving the same outbreak strain. Several of these individuals also reported contact with cats or birds. Conclusions Passerine birds are a well-documented reservoir for S. Typhimurium in the Nordic region, often leading to transmission to both cats and humans. This outbreak highlights the role of animal exposure in the spread of S. Typhimurium and emphasize the need for timely, targeted public health communication on infection prevention measures.",

Single-center retrospective case-control study involving 31 adults who had clinical/imaging/neurophysiology concordant evidence of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy in the language dominant hemisphere submitted to temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. GA was used in 20 patients and AAA in 11 patients. Presurgical characteristics of the patients, intraoperative hemodynamic and physiological findings or complications and postoperative outcomes including ILAE scale scores at least 1 year of follow-up were analyzed using descriptive statistics and independent t-tests, Fisher’s exact test, and χ² tests to identify differences between the groups. During the surgery, there were no notable differences between the groups in terms of hemodynamic parameters, arterial blood gas measurements, or bleeding. However, the surgery length was longer in AAA group. Postoperative outcomes, including hospital stay duration, complication rates, and follow-up periods, were also comparable without significant differences. Neurological deficits were minimal in both groups, with no statistically significant differences between them. Most patients achieved positive results based on the ILAE classification in both groups, with most experiencing either no seizures or rare, non-disabling seizures. AAA showed comparable results to general anesthesia, with no intraoperative complications or postoperative negative outcomes. However, due to the limited sample size, further evidence is needed to confirm its benefits in epilepsy surgery involving eloquent areas over GA.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae (Rossi), is a key pest of the olive tree worldwide. This study explores whether the endophytes Alcaligenes faecalis , Aureobasidium pullulans , Bacillus amyloliquefaciens , and Penicillium commune can trigger the emission of repellent volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in olive trees, targeting B. oleae . Accordingly, olive trees were inoculated with each endophyte or with buffer (control), and after 3 months, both fruits and leaves were collected to perform olfactometer assays and to evaluate VOCs by HS-SPME and GC–MS. Alcaligenes faecalis , A. pullulans , and B. amyloliquefaciens were found to significantly repel B. oleae females, with each treatment inducing a distinct VOC profile. Alcaligenes faecalis and B. amyloliquefaciens were characterized by higher levels of alkenes, including o-cymene and d-limonene, while P. commune and A. pullulans induced the emission of alkanes. Six VOCs were found to be negatively correlated with fly entries in the olfactometer assays, with beta-myrcene being the most prominent, followed by d-limonene, o-cymene, and 5-octadecene (E). These repellent VOCs were positively correlated with each other, indicating that their combined emission may produce synergistic effects, potentially enhancing their repellency. In contrast, 1, 4-hexadiene, 5-methyl-3-(1-methyl ethylidene) was identified as an attractant, showing a strong positive correlation with fly entries, and appeared to be produced through different biosynthetic pathways than the repellent VOCs. Overall, this work identifies three endophytes and a combination of repellent VOCs as promising new strategies for sustainable management of the olive fruit fly.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Aim We aimed to investigate the association of distractions at work and perceived occupational challenges with psychosocial outcomes among the adult German population. Subject and methods A quota-based online sample of the German adult population (representative in terms of gender, age group, and federal state) was used. We restricted our sample to the working population aged 18 to 64 years ( n = 2274 individuals). The mean age was 41.7 years (SD 12.7 years). Widely used and psychometrically sound tools were used to quantify the psychosocial outcomes. Multiple linear regressions were estimated. Results Overall, 19.5% felt somewhat underchallenged and 8.0% felt somewhat overwhelmed (the rest felt challenged just right) in their job. In the preceding 4 weeks, 15.1% of the respondents had never engaged in activities that did not directly contribute to their professional duties (rarely, 29.2%; sometimes, 37.4%; often, 13.6%; very often, 4.7%). Adjusting for covariates, regressions showed that a higher frequency of distractions at work (in particular often or very often compared to never) was consistently associated with poorer psychosocial outcomes, except for life satisfaction and ikigai. Additionally, being somewhat underchallenged (compared to challenged just right) was mostly unrelated to the psychosocial outcomes. In contrast, being somewhat overwhelmed was consistently associated with poorer psychosocial outcomes. Conclusion Frequent distractions at work and feeling overwhelmed in particular are associated with poor psychosocial outcomes. This study advances our current knowledge of the link between distractions at work and excessive demands and their psychosocial outcomes. We recommend cross-country comparisons and longitudinal studies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Astrocytes regulate the activity of nearby neurons so disruption of astrocyte calcium dynamics by traumatic brain injury (TBI) could have profound consequences for neural network activity in the brain. This study aimed to define how mechanical stretch injury alters calcium signaling, mitochondrial membrane potential, and mechanosensitive ion channel organization in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived astrocytes. Methods Human iPSC-derived astrocytes were subjected to controlled two-dimensional stretch injury across multiple severities. Live-cell calcium and mitochondrial membrane potential imaging, Piezo1 immunostaining, and RNA sequencing were used to assess functional and transcriptional responses. Results Cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential, and spontaneous calcium transients declined in a severity-dependent manner. At moderate injury levels, reductions in mitochondrial function, calcium dynamics, and Piezo1 spatial distribution were transient. RNA sequencing identified 196 differentially expressed genes, including downregulation of mitochondrial and oxidative metabolic pathways and upregulation of cortical thinning–associated pathways. Conclusion This platform captures functional and molecular hallmarks of astrocyte injury and provides a human in vitro model for studying mechanobiological pathways linking TBI to neurodegenerative processes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The initial development of the digestive system and the expression of the genes that codify the proteolytic enzymes – pepsin and trypsin – and the peptide transporter – pept1 – were investigated in the larvae of the tambaqui, Colossoma macropomum . The larvae were raised in recirculating aquaculture system (27.99 ± 0.05°C) until 36 Days After Hatching (DAH), being then fed on Artemia nauplii up to 21 DAH, when pelleted feed (55% crude protein) was introduced. The weight and total length of the C. macropomum larvae were conferred at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 26, 31 and 36 DAH, when samples of whole larvae were also obtained for histological analysis and the determination of gene expression. Initially, the digestive tract of the larvae was a straight tube, with the first intestinal loop and epithelial folds being formed between 15 (11.06 ± 0.50 mg, 9.91 ± 0.11 mm) and 18 DAH (27.03 ± 1.76 mg, 11.36 ± 0.20 mm). The development of the pyloric caeca was identified from 21 DAH (56.03 ± 3.00 mg, 14.07 ± 0.23 mm) onwards. The gastric glands were observed initially at 12 DAH (4.17 ± 0.20 mg, 7.89 ± 0.12 mm) and the pyloric region was clearly identifiable at 21 DAH (56.03 ± 3.00 mg, 14.07 ± 0.23 mm). The expression of the pepsin and pept1 genes was detected at 12 DAH (4.17 ± 0.20 mg, 7.89 ± 0.12 mm), while the trypsin gene was detected from 21 DAH (56.03 ± 3.00 mg, 14.07 ± 0.23 mm) onwards. These findings demonstrate ontogenetic synchrony between morphological and functional maturation of the digestive tract, with C. macropomum larvae showing increased digestive capacity around 21 DAH.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by dopaminergic neuronal loss, often associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitophagy. Here, we investigated the role of HUWE1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, in regulating mitophagy and neuronal survival in a cellular PD model. HUWE1 promoted mitophagy, whereas its depletion sensitized SH-SY5Y cells to 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)- and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP⁺)-induced cytotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Notably, both toxins downregulated HUWE1, suggesting that loss of HUWE1 contributes to dopaminergic vulnerability. Conversely, HUWE1 overexpression preserved mitochondrial integrity and enhanced mitophagy under neurotoxic stress. Importantly, BL-918, a ULK1 activator that promotes AMBRA1 recruitment, facilitated HUWE1-mediated mitophagy in SH-SY5Y cells. BL-918 treatment significantly attenuated 6-OHDA- and MPP⁺-induced neurotoxicity and protected mitochondrial function via HUWE1 activation. Collectively, these findings identify HUWE1 as a key mechanistic regulator of mitophagy linked to dopaminergic neuronal vulnerability, and provide a conceptual framework for future investigations examining its role in PD–relevant model systems. Graphical Abstract Highlights • HUWE1 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates mitophagy in dopaminergic neurons. • Neurotoxicity induced by 6-OHDA or MPP + reduces HUWE1 expression, thereby inhibiting mitophagy in dopaminergic neurons. • Overexpression or activation of HUWE1 promotes the clearance of damaged mitochondria under neurotoxic stress. • BL-918 enhances HUWE1-mediated mitophagy and mitigates neurotoxin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic neurons.",

    "Abstract": "Astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, key neuroglial cell types, are essential for central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, immune regulation, and neuronal support. In neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), glial dysfunction contributes to pathogenesis via chronic inflammation, synaptic disruption, oxidative stress, and impaired myelination. Growing evidence highlights the regulatory influence of sex hormones on glial function. These hormones modulate inflammatory tone, synaptic remodeling, and remyelination, potentially contributing to sex-based differences in disease incidence, progression, and treatment response. This review synthesizes current understanding of glial involvement in neurodegeneration and examines how gonadal hormones interact with astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes. By integrating glial biology with neuroendocrinology, we propose that hormone-glia interactions represent promising, personalized targets for sex-informed therapies in CNS disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Individual cognitive differences may cause decision makers to interpret the same linguistic terms differently. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel consensus model for large-scale group decision-making by incorporating personalized individual semantics into a probabilistic linguistic preference framework. A normalization method integrating emotional tone is introduced to refine probabilistic linguistic preference relations, and an additive consistency-based semantic optimization model is developed to assign appropriate linguistic terms to decision makers. To promote interaction among those with similar interests, a weighting method based on semantic similarity and a fuzzy clustering algorithm using personalized individual semantics are employed to form subgroups with similar semantics. A consensus-reaching process, including assessment and feedback stages, is then applied to guide decision makers toward agreement. A case study on environmental project selection verifies the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Decades of research suggests that internship participation in college supports students’ career development and transition into post-college careers. Given the gender and racial/ethnic equity gaps in the STEM workforce, especially in the subfield of computing and technology, increasing the number of students who participate in computing-related internships during college may be one way to promote broader participation in these fields. Yet, few studies have examined internships as a pathway to careers in computing and technology for women and Students of Color majoring in fields other than computing. This study examines the characteristics of non-computing students who participated in computing-related internships and the nature of these experiences. Using survey data from 15 institutions and social cognitive career theory as a guiding framework, we find that 51% of non-computing students who participated in computing-related internships reported that they were more interested in a computing career following their internships. Computing self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of intent to pursue a career in computing among non-computing majors. Results also explore differences in gender and race/ethnicity in internship participation and experiences, with implications for higher education policy and practice.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective Minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) has become increasingly popular for treating primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). However, data regarding complications for patients with comorbid diabetic retinopathy (DR) are limited. This study aimed to compare complications after MIGS in POAG patients with and without DR. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX global health network. Adult patients with POAG who underwent MIGS were identified, with one group having comorbid DR and the other without. Propensity score matching was applied, yielding 518 patients per group for analysis. Complications assessed included vision loss, hypotony, ocular hypertension, cataract formation, eye infection, and any ocular hemorrhage. The primary outcomes were post-procedure complication rates and their statistical significance. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed. Results Patients with DR who underwent MIGS had a higher risk for vision loss (32.8% vs. 24.4%, HR 1.443, 95% CI 1.13–1.841) and ocular hemorrhage (13.4% vs. 4.3%, HR 3.194, 95% CI 1.929–5.288) compared to those without DR. Cataract formation rates were lower in DR patients at 3 months (44.4% vs. 50.6%, p = 0.046) and 6 months (53.3% vs. 59.5%, p = 0.048) post-surgery. No significant differences were observed in rates of hypotony, ocular hypertension, or eye infection. Conclusion MIGS in patients with DR is associated with an increased risk of post-procedure complications, particularly vision loss and ocular hemorrhage. These findings can aid in the clinical management and counseling of patients with both POAG and DR considering MIGS.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The papain-like protease of SARS-CoV-2 (PLpro2) is integral to viral polyprotein cleavage and the modulation of host immune responses, positioning it as a critical target for antiviral drug development. Here, we elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing the noncovalent inhibition of PLpro2 through a comprehensive computational approach, including molecular docking, extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, binding free energy calculations (MM/GBSA and SIE), principal component and free energy landscape (PCA/FEL) analyses, and protein–ligand interaction fingerprinting (ProLIF). We assessed a structurally diverse set of noncovalent inhibitors for their capacity to induce conformational rearrangements and stabilize key structural motifs of PLpro2, with particular emphasis on the BL2 loop. Notably, XR3 and A19 exhibited superior experimental and predicted binding affinities, which can be attributed to favorable contacts with essential residues Tyr268 and Gln269, the attenuation of loop dynamics, and the stabilization of energetically favorable conformational states. By contrast, less potent inhibitors were associated with increased conformational heterogeneity, fragmented free energy landscapes, and diminished interactions with critical loop residues. Therefore, our integrative analysis delineates the structural and energetic determinants underpinning noncovalent PLpro2 inhibition, underscoring the central roles of loop immobilization and π-stacking interactions in the rational design of next-generation PLpro2 inhibitors.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Carbon aerogels derived from organic precursors are gaining attention in various applications, especially in energy storage. On one hand, this paper deals with the substitution of phenolic materials by tannin which could be beneficial to both the bioeconomy and the environment due to its low-cost, bio-based, and non-toxic characteristics. On the other hand, the comparative study aims to explore advantages and drawbacks of both aerogels, their electrical conductivity, morphology, performance in an electrochemical cell, and materials costs. The results illustrate that both nitrogen-doped aerogels exhibit pyridinic and pyrrolic functional groups, while doping with melamine leads to higher nitrogen amount about 5 wt.-% compared against ammonia treatment (1–2.5 wt.-%). RF-based carbon aerogels exhibit almost twice the electrical conductivity of tannin-based carbon aerogels. The electrochemical performance of both carbon aerogels in an electrochemical cell is comparable to literature-reported cases. The capacitance of non-doped aerogels was found to be the highest, reaching 239 F‧g –1 at a current density of 0.5 A g –1 . Material costs of tannin-based electrodes are slightly lower compared to those based on resorcinol. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The green synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticles has emerged as a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative to conventional chemical methods. Utilizing plant-derived phytochemicals as natural reducing and stabilizing agents, this approach eliminates hazardous chemicals and energy-intensive processes. Beyond environmental benefits, green synthesis influences the physicochemical and biological properties of nanoparticles by enhancing surface functionality, stability, and bioactivity. Zinc oxide nanoparticles are widely favored in biomedical applications due to their biocompatibility, affordability, and low toxicity. Their therapeutic effects, especially in anticancer and antibacterial applications, arise from their ability to generate reactive oxygen species, release Zn 2+ ions, and induce apoptosis. This study synthesized ZnO NPs via chemical and green routes using aqueous extracts from Medicago sativa , Euphorbia milii , Codiaeum variegatum , and Helianthus annuus . Structural analysis confirmed that green synthesis did not alter the ZnO crystalline structure. However, biological activities varied significantly by plant extract. Codiaeum variegatum -mediated ZnO NPs showed superior antioxidant activity (60.8% DPPH scavenging) and strong cytotoxicity against A549 lung cancer cells (94.7% reduction). Chemically synthesized ZnO NPs exhibited notable anti-inflammatory activity (90.4%). ZnO NPs from Medicago sativa demonstrated potent antidiabetic effects via α-amylase (86.5%) and α-glucosidase (85.7%) inhibition. All ZnO NPs inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumonia, Streptococcus pyrogenes , and Staphylococcus aureus with maximum MBC value 47.4 mg/ml of chemogenic ZnO NPs against S. aureus and 44.4 mg/ml for biogenic ZnO NPs against S. pyrogenes . Additionally, Medicago sativa ZnO NPs recorded the highest suppression of S. pyogenes biofilm formation by 79%. The obtained results highlight the role of green synthesis as an effective strategy to tailor ZnO NP bioactivity for biomedical applications.",

In contrast, variable refrigerant flow (VRF) systems demonstrated superior part-load efficiency, with monthly consumption reduced to 9626.9 kWh and energy performance indices (ENPI) improved by 36.6%. Ground source heat pumps (GSHPs) operating under stable subsurface conditions achieved thermal outputs of 7.0–16.0 kW with COP values ranging from 1.34 to 4.7, while hybrid systems integrating desiccant wheels and evaporative cooling reported cooling capacities between 0.84 and 16.9 kW, and COPs reaching up to 35.2 under optimised conditions. Photovoltaic-assisted systems were capable of offsetting up to 80% of cooling energy demand, equating to approximately 3.5–4.0 kWh/day savings in residential settings. Control strategies such as night purge and adaptive setpoint scheduling yielded energy reductions of 17–26%, and the integration of economisers led to a 25.5% drop in total HVAC consumption. Advanced predictive models incorporating artificial intelligence achieved accuracy levels exceeding R 2 = 0.98 across simulations of over 250,000 scenarios. These findings collectively underline the critical importance of selecting context-appropriate HVAC technologies and implementing intelligent, climate-responsive control to achieve substantial reductions in system loads, power input, and operational energy demand, thereby supporting global efforts towards sustainable and low-carbon buildings.",

    "Abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy frequently co-occur, yet clinically actionable markers to stratify seizure risk and anticipate drug resistance remain limited. We evaluated whether plasma γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the chloride co-transporters KCC2 and NKCC1, singly and in combination, provide a discriminative signal for ASD status and severity using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology. Forty-six males with ASD and twenty-six age-matched neurotypical controls were phenotyped with the Childhood Autism Rating Scale and Social Responsiveness Scale. Plasma GABA, KCC2, and NKCC1 were quantified by ELISA. Nonparametric tests, logistic regression, and combined ROC analyses were applied. ASD was associated with reduced GABA (0.06 ± 0.04 vs. 0.12 ± 0.05 ng/mL), KCC2 (1.19 ± 1.01 vs. 4.92 ± 3.27 ng/mL), and NKCC1 (8.07 ± 7.08 vs. 10.96 ± 6.72 ng/mL) relative to controls (all p ≤ 0.035), alongside a lower KCC2/NKCC1 ratio (0.193 ± 0.172 vs. 0.525 ± 0.365; p = 0.001). KCC2 and NKCC1 were positively correlated in controls (R = 0.634; p = 0.001), whereas in severe ASD, GABA correlated negatively with KCC2 (R = - 0.638; p = 0.004), consistent with altered chloride homeostasis and GABAergic signaling. Discrimination was highest for KCC2 overall (AUC = 0.931) and in severe ASD (AUC = 0.987); GABA showed good discrimination (AUC = 0.827), and NKCC1 was modest (AUC = 0.664). Marker combinations improved classification: KCC2 + GABA achieved AUC = 0.939 overall and 0.922 in mild-moderate ASD, while GABA + NKCC1 reached AUC = 0.885 in severe ASD. Logistic models yielded odds ratios < 1 across strata, aligning with the observed decrements in ASD. These data indicate that combined ROC analysis of peripheral measures indexing neuronal chloride transport and inhibition provides a robust discriminative signal for ASD stratification and may inform future, mechanism-guided studies of seizure liability and pharmacoresistance.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Despite important advancements in diagnostic modalities, routine use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and newer antifungal therapies, there is a paucity of contemporary data regarding clinical characteristics and outcomes of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in the United States. Methods Single-center, retrospective cohort study of hospitalized patients between 2015 and 2020, who had active hematological malignancy (HM) or had undergone transplantation and cellular therapy (TCT) and had probable or proven IA. Results Sixty-two patients with probable or proven IA, including 21 HM and 41 TCT, were identified. Forty-four percent of the cases corresponded to breakthrough IA. Bronchoalveolar lavage galactomannan was ≥ 1 in 71% and ≥ 0.5 in 88%, while serum galactomannan was ≥ 0.5 in only 34%. Among assessable patients (n = 59), 90-day partial or complete response to antifungal therapy occurred in 39%. All-cause mortality for the entire cohort was 22% at 30 days and 46% at 90 days. IA attributable mortality was 18% at 30 days and 38% at 90 days. Achieving therapeutic antifungal serum levels was associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality, while prior clinically significant CMV infection (aOR 9.65, 95% CI 1.34–69.6; P = 0.025) and relapsed/refractory hematological disease (aOR 8.5, 95% CI 2.23, 32.4; P = 0.002) were associated with higher IA attributable mortality. Conclusions Despite advancements in diagnosis and treatment, IA remains associated with poor outcomes in hematological patients in the contemporary era. Newer antifungals and improved strategies for monitoring and prevention of IA in these vulnerable patient populations are urgently needed.",

To this end, a study was conducted based on the responses of 27 participants who filled out an online questionnaire. Of this sample, most respondents were Portuguese or currently living in Portugal, which leads to increased insight into a phenomenon that has not been adequately addressed or explored in Portugal. The data were subjected to a thematic analysis, which identified seven recurring themes: social context, expression of sexuality, minority groups, expression of sexuality by minority groups, mental health, prejudice and discrimination, and areas needing improvement. The qualitative nature of this investigation made it possible to explore a reality, lived in the first person, that is marked by the influence of LGBTphobia, sexism, and religious conservatism in the silencing and concealment of the sexual expression of members and former members of conservative religious congregations and the consequent victimization practices and effects on mental health.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background and aims A major challenge in root exudation research is obtaining exudates samples that accurately reflect the exudation processes under natural soil growth conditions. Both growth environment and experimental setup can significantly influence root exudation dynamics. This study investigated how different experimental systems and growth conditions affect carbon exudation in maize ( Zea mays L.) roots and whether these factors could influence the detection of genotypic differences between the wild type (B73) and its hairless mutant, rth3. Methods Maize plants were grown under various experimental conditions, including soil-based and hydroponic systems. Root exudates were collected using a combination of traditional and innovative sampling approaches. Carbon exudation rates were compared across experimental setups and genotypes. Laboratory results were further compared with data from a separate field experiment. Results Exudation rates obtained from soil-based laboratory experiments were comparable to those observed in the field under similar growth temperatures. The contribution of root hairs to total carbon exudation was negligible compared to the effect of growth conditions and experimental setup. Large differences in root biomass introduced bias into exudation measurements, particularly when root to sampling volume ratio (RSVR) varied substantially. Conclusions Experimental setup and environmental conditions have a strong influence on root exudation measurement. Soil-based laboratory systems that closely replicate field conditions, particularly temperature, can serve as reliable proxies for field experiments, providing ecologically meaningful data. Maintaining a consistent RSVR is also essential for obtaining accurate and comparable results. These findings offer important methodological guidance for reliably quantifying root carbon exudation in maize",

    "Abstract": "Lakes Koka and Ziway in the Central Rift Valley (CRV) of Ethiopia are essential socio-ecological systems that provide water for domestic use, irrigation, hydropower, and fisheries, while also sustaining diverse biological communities. However, these lakes are under severe ecological stress due to intensifying anthropogenic pollution from industrial, agricultural, and urban sources. This review synthesizes multidisciplinary evidence on pollution sources, types, and ecological consequences, focusing on impacts to water quality and ecosystem services. Physicochemical data reveal that concentrations of heavy metals, nutrients, and organic pollutants regularly exceed World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, with alarming levels of nitrate, phosphate, lead, chromium, and cadmium observed in both lakes. Agricultural runoff, industrial effluents, and untreated municipal wastewater emerge as primary pollution sources. These contaminants drive eutrophication, biodiversity loss, and the decline of fisheries, thereby undermining livelihoods and exacerbating water insecurity. Invasive species such as water hyacinth further degrade aquatic habitats, while sedimentation alters hydrological dynamics. The review highlights the flowing impacts of pollution on ecosystem services, including disruption of water supply, economic loss, and health risks. It also identifies knowledge gaps and emphasizes the need for integrated watershed governance, investment in wastewater treatment technologies, adoption of sustainable agricultural practices, and enhanced community participation. The review underscores the urgency of adopting a multisectoral response grounded in Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), emphasizing collaborative governance, technological innovation, and community-led stewardship as pathways to restore and sustain the health and services of lake ecosystems in the CRV.",

    "Abstract": "This study demonstrates the valorization of bone waste from different animal sources as a sustainable approach to produce high-value hydroxyapatite (HA) powders, supporting circular economy principles. The findings provide a scientific basis for selecting bone waste sources depending on desired material properties, promoting resource-efficient recovery and reuse of biowaste. Three different types of bone-bovine, ostrich, and porcine-were selected for this research to compare species-dependent differences in HA derived from animal sources. Bovine bone served as a common reference, ostrich bone represented a non-mammalian source, and porcine bone was chosen for its close structural similarity to human bone. The HA powders were characterized in terms of particle size, specific surface area, crystallite size, phase composition, and porosity. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed variations in crystallite size with calcination temperature. Mechanical testing revealed that bovine-derived HA exhibited the highest compressive strength (17 MPa) and porcine-derived HA showed the highest hardness (0.5 GPa). These findings highlight the significant influence of the bone source on the microstructural and physicochemical properties of HA, providing a foundation for selecting optimal HA sources for targeted applications. With the results obtained in this paper, it is possible to select the animal of origin of the bones to be used based on the desired characteristics of the powder to be developed.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract College students face multiple stressors that increase vulnerability to mental health challenges and risky substance use, including simultaneous polysubstance use (using multiple substances at once), which poses significant health risks. This study examined the relationship between polysubstance use and depressive symptoms among a quota‑based sample of college students. Data from 2155 students who reported past-year alcohol use were analyzed using multivariable linear regression. Measures included self-reported indices of past-month alcohol, cannabis, and non-prescribed stimulant use (individually and simultaneously); depressive symptoms; and adverse childhood experiences. Cannabis and stimulant use were associated with higher depressive symptoms ( p &lt; 0.01). Alcohol-stimulant polysubstance use was associated with depressive symptoms ( p &lt; 0.05), while alcohol-cannabis was not ( p &gt; 0.05). Adverse childhood experiences remained a significant correlate of depressive symptoms across all models. Findings underscore the need for campus mental health prevention and intervention efforts addressing polysubstance use and incorporating trauma-informed strategies for early childhood adversity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives To evaluate the distribution patterns of sarcoidosis involvement on FDG-PET/CT in patients with known or suspected cardiac sarcoidosis (CS), with a particular focus on upper abdominal lymph nodes (LN) (periportal LN [PLN], anterior pancreaticoduodenal LN [APDLN], and posterior pancreaticoduodenal LN [PPDLN]) and the association of them with other lesions and myocardium. Methods We identified 861 FDG-PET/CT scans performed between July 2016 and August 2024 in patients with known or suspected CS, and included 178 cases for analysis of FDG uptake patterns suggestive of sarcoid involvement. FDG-positive LNs or regions were classified as sarcoidosis-related based on treatment response, characteristic uptake patterns, or histological confirmation. The occurrence ratio of FDG-positive lymph nodes or regions was also assessed in relation to myocardial FDG uptake patterns. Results FDG uptake was observed most frequently in hilar and mediastinal LNs (79% and 76%, respectively). Upper abdominal LN uptake was observed in 49.4% of patients, most commonly in the PLN (31.5%), APDLN (38.2%), and PPDLN (37.1%). Heatmap analyses revealed strong co-occurrence between thoracic and upper abdominal LNs, suggesting a lymphatic dissemination pattern. Peripheral LNs such as axillary, subclavian, and inguinal/pelvic stations demonstrated low uptake and minimal co-occurrence. Conclusions FDG-PET/CT provides valuable insight into the structured lymphatic dissemination of sarcoidosis. Frequent FDG uptake in upper abdominal lymph nodes, particularly when accompanied by thoracic involvement, represents a characteristic finding in sarcoidosis. Recognition of this pattern can improve diagnostic accuracy and help differentiate sarcoidosis from other systemic diseases. Secondary abstract This study assessed lymph node involvement on FDG-PET/CT in patients with suspected or known cardiac sarcoidosis, revealing distinct dissemination patterns into the upper abdomen. These findings enhance understanding of disease pathophysiology and may improve diagnostic evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose This study aimed to develop and validate machine learning models based on quantitative radiomics parameters extracted from T1-weighted MRI to differentiate enchondromas from atypical cartilaginous tumours (ACTs). Methods A retrospective cohort comprising 66 patients (35 with histopathologically confirmed enchondroma and 31 with ACT) was included in the study. T1-weighted MRI images were used for 2D segmentation, performed independently by two experienced observers on all visible slices of each lesion. A comprehensive set of 107 radiomics features was extracted from these segmented regions of interest. LASSO regression was applied for dimensionality reduction. Four distinct machine learning algorithms—Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Decision Tree Analysis—were trained and validated using a 70:30 data split. Results The radiomics features demonstrated high inter- and intra-observer reproducibility. All evaluated machine learning models exhibited strong diagnostic performance, with Area Under the Curve (AUC) values exceeding 0.90. Specifically, SVM achieved an AUC of 0.922 (95% CI 0.893–0.951), RFC yielded an AUC of 0.920 (95% CI 0.881–0.963), and Decision Tree Analysis showed an AUC of 0.949 (95% CI 0.927–0.972). Notably, the XGBoost model achieved the highest diagnostic efficacy, boasting an impressive AUC of 0.987 (95% CI 0.976–0.999), coupled with a sensitivity of 89.35% and a specificity of 96.55%. Conclusion Our results indicate that the combination of MRI-based radiomics and machine learning algorithms, particularly XGBoost, offers a non-invasive and highly accurate method for distinguishing enchondroma from ACT.",

    "Abstract": "AI-enhanced robotic hands are rapidly reshaping tumour surgery by merging real-time sensing, precision mechanics, and intelligent decision support, yet current systems still struggle with early lesion detection, limited tactile sensitivity, and inconsistent accuracy across cancer types. This review addresses these gaps by examining how next-generation robotic hands, empowered by multimodal AI, augmented imaging, hybrid guidance, and minimally invasive mechatronics, can improve early tumour localization and safer resections. The study synthesizes insights from urologic, breast, colorectal, gastric, thoracic, and gynecologic oncology to highlight shared trends such as the shift toward personalized robotics, smart biopsy tools, light-mediated theranostics, flexible platforms, and real-time intraoperative analytics. A comparative reading of quantitative and qualitative evidence reveals strong gains in surgical precision and patient outcomes, yet also contradictions regarding cost-effectiveness, reproducibility of AI predictions, and disparity in adoption between high- and low-resource settings. Using a narrative review approach, key findings point to robotic hands with enhanced tactile sensors and AI-driven micro-maneuvering as promising breakthroughs for detecting microtumours, reducing positive margins, and guiding on-table diagnostics. Recommendations emphasize stronger clinical validation, interoperable imaging ecosystems, and ethical design. The implications extend to safer surgeries, shorter recovery, and more equitable cancer care. Limitations include heterogeneous study designs and early-stage prototypes. Future research should explore adaptive learning models, haptic-guided autonomy, and broader trials. Overall, AI-enhanced robotic hands signal a transformative pathway for earlier detection and more precise tumour removal.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Ashwagandha ( W. somnifera ), known for its broad health benefits, has shown potential in cancer prevention and treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential effect of ashwagandha aqueous extract (ASH-AE) on cell proliferation and therapy resistance markers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An in vitro study was conducted using the HepG2 cell line. The HepG2 cells were divided into 4 groups according to the treatment regimen received. ASH-AE was extracted from the whole plant and characterized by GC-MS and HPLC. HepG2 cell viability was determined for all groups. The protein expression of cluster of differentiation 90 (CD90) was determined by flow cytometry technique. Also, the gene expression of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Patched 1(PTCH1) and ATP-binding cassette subfamily C1 (ABCC1) was assayed by qRT-PCR. The protein expression and localization of glioma-associated oncogene 1 (Gli1) in HepG2 cells were determined by immunocytochemistry (ICC) assay. The results indicated that ASH-AE either alone or in combination with sorafenib (SOR) significantly reduced HepG2 cell viability in a concentration dependent manner (P ˂0.001) with IC50 was 6.65 mg/ml for ASH-AE, 11.3 µM for SOR, and 5.6 mg/ml + 18.6 µM for ASH-AE in combination with SOR. Moreover, SOR significantly increased the percentage of CD90 + cells and Gli1 protein expression and nuclear translocation as well as ABCC1 gene expression compared to untreated cells. On the other hand, ASH-AE either alone or in combination with SOR significantly decreased the percentage of CD90 + cells and Gli1 expression and nuclear translocation as well as SHH, PTCH1 and ABCC1 gene expression compared to untreated cells and that treated with SOR. We concluded for the first time that the combination of SOR and ASH-AE generates antagonistic antitumor effect in HepG2 cells. Moreover, ASH-AE can inhibit proliferation of HepG2 cells and mitigate sorafenib-induced resistance-associated markers in HepG2 cells by targeting CD90 + cells via Hedgehog pathway modulation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a major health burden in Asia. Advances in antiviral therapies are reshaping the etiological landscape of HCC. This study evaluated temporal shifts in HCC etiology across Asian countries and their clinical implications. Methods This multinational study analyzed 6,261 newly diagnosed HCC patients registered in the APASL Hepatology/Oncology Consortium (A-HOC) from 19 centers across seven Asian countries and regions between 2013 and 2023. Data on demographics, tumor characteristics, etiology, and treatment patterns were collected. Etiologies included hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), alcoholic liver disease (ALD), metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), MAFLD plus excess alcoholic intake (MAFLD + eAL), autoimmune liver disease, cryptogenic, and others. Temporal trends and regional variations were assessed. Results In many countries, HBV remained predominant (43.3%–69.5%) and relatively stable throughout the period, while HCV showed only modest reductions. In Japan, HCV was the leading cause of HCC (33.1%), with a significant decline over time, accompanied by a rise in MAFLD-related HCC. ALD-related HCC increased in South Korea, and MAFLD-related HCC rose in Turkey. Tumor size and stage at diagnosis varied by etiology and region, affecting treatment strategies. Early-stage diagnosis was more frequent in Japan and Taiwan, whereas advanced-stage HCC was common in China and Indonesia. Conclusions Distinct regional patterns and temporal changes in HCC etiology across Asia highlight the need for tailored prevention and surveillance measures. The growing burden of MAFLD-related HCC emphasizes its emerging role in liver cancer development, particularly in regions with declining viral hepatitis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper tackles the complex issue of \"race\" and \"diversity\" in contemporary robotics. Studies conducted by Sparrow (Sci Technol Hum Values 45 3 538 560) and Bartneck et al. (Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human Robot Interaction, Chicago, 2018) concluded that the (mediated) image and (material) shape of robots reveal discrimination and segregation processes similar to those experienced by ethnic minorities in contemporary societies—and they are as such, machine embodiments of human racism. It is true that there seems to exist a formal standardisation of robots' appearance, often inspired by Western cultural models. But in the global and rapid developments of robotics, robots are also increasingly dyed with the colours of ethnic diversity—they are \"racialised\" to better fit alternative models (ethnic black robots, Asian-styled humanoids, and so on). Yet, most anthropomorphic robots are race-free. Beyond the burning issue of apparent/alleged \"racism\" in robot design and, by extension, the existence of the WEIRD ( Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, Democratic) complex in contemporary robotics and technologies, this paper examines different models of robots designed in countries from the Global South (Africa, Asia) and raises the fundamental ambivalence of robots that are both subjected to racism (as almost human) and racialised (coloured) / used as weapons of resistance against racial discrimination.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper examines the transformation of Craver’s (2009) mutual manipulability (MM) account into the matched interlevel experiments (MIE) framework (Craver et al., 2021) and argues that it amounts to a theoretical reduction of mechanistic constitutive relations to causal mediation. While the MIE account successfully resolves the incoherence challenge that plagued MM, it does so by eliminating the distinctive theoretical content that constitutive categories were supposed to provide. The processual reframing that enables this solution replaces hierarchical part-whole relationships with temporal causal sequences, changing what mechanistic explanations are understood to accomplish. Drawing on paradigmatic action potential experiments, I demonstrate that practices satisfying MIE’s formal requirements consistently establish causal mediation relationships without requiring constitutive interpretation. I address several theoretical defenses of constitutive categories—including interpretive objections about two types of constitution, arguments for distinctive explanatory value, and appeals to mechanistic levels—showing that none can rescue constitutive distinctiveness once constitution is explicitly identified with causal betweenness. Rather than undermining mechanistic approaches, this analysis suggests that their explanatory power derives from methodological sophistication in investigating complex, multi-scale causal structures rather than from categorically distinct constitutive relationships.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper presents a hybrid sentiment analysis framework tailored for the Greek language, combining a novel lexicon construction methodology with an Active Learning (AL) strategy to enhance performance and minimize annotation effort. A domain-specific lexicon was developed using two original metrics—Score w , capturing the sentiment polarity of words, and Weight w , reflecting their combined emotional and statistical importance. These metrics enabled the transformation of tweet-level annotations into semantically rich word-level representations. To evaluate the framework, four classification models (Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Trees) were trained with and without lexicon-derived features. The results showed substantial improvements in accuracy and F1-score when incorporating the lexicon, especially for Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models. Furthermore, a dynamic Active Learning approach was employed, where the lexicon was reconstructed in each cycle using the evolving labeled dataset. This strategy achieved the same levels of accuracy and Macro F1-score, as with full-supervision framework, while using only 30% of the data. The findings demonstrate the efficacy of combining lexicon enhancement with uncertainty-based sampling, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for sentiment analysis in low-resource languages such as Greek.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) remains one of the most common malignant tumors among men worldwide, typically relying on the androgen receptor (AR) signaling pathway. Inducing ferroptosis, a novel form of iron-dependent cell death, represents a promising strategy; however, its regulation by AR signaling is complex. The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is critical for AR stability and function, yet its role as a therapeutic target in this context is underexplored. The anti-proliferative effect of the compound nidurufin (Nid) was assessed across PCa cell lines using MTT, clonogenic, and 3D spheroid assays. Ferroptosis was evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, and lipid peroxidation analysis. Mechanistic insights were gained through Western blot, qPCR, immunofluorescence, ChIP-qPCR, molecular docking, and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA). In vivo efficacy was validated in a zebrafish xenograft model. Nid exhibited potent, selective anti-proliferative activity against AR-positive PCa cells, particularly 22Rv1 (IC₅₀ = 10.30 μM), and induced ferroptosis characterized by mitochondrial shrinkage and ROS accumulation. Mechanistically, Nid did not bind to AR, but it directly bound to HSP70, disrupting its chaperone function and leading to AR protein destabilization and transcriptional downregulation. This consequently suppressed the expression of the AR-target gene membrane-associated O-acyltransferase domain protein 2 (MBOAT2), a key ferroptosis suppressor enzyme. ChIP-qPCR confirmed AR directly binds the MBOAT2 promoter, and Nid treatment reduced this enrichment. In vivo, Nid significantly inhibited tumor growth and metastasis in a zebrafish xenograft model. Our study identifies Nid as a novel HSP70-targeted compound that triggers ferroptosis by disrupting the HSP70-AR-MBOAT2 axis. This work not only reveals a previously unrecognized connection between protein chaperone function and ferroptotic susceptibility but also positions HSP70 as a compelling therapeutic target for overcoming AR-pathway dependency in PCa.

    "Abstract": "Abstract The crisis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is escalating while the antibiotic pipeline remains stagnant. Our bibliometric analysis of eight decades of literature reveals a critical imbalance: research on AMR has grown, yet fundamental research on antibiotic discovery has declined. Most strikingly, research attention to Actinomycetota , the source of most clinical antibiotics, has sharply decreased since its mid-twentieth-century peak. This therapeutic disinvestment coincides with the intensifying AMR crisis. We argue for a strategic reinvestment in natural product discovery, now enabled by advances in genomics, artificial intelligence, and synthetic biology. These tools can unlock the vast, silent biosynthetic potential of actinobacteria, transforming discovery into a targeted and efficient endeavor. Rebalancing research priorities by coupling this historically proven source with modern technology is essential to revive the antibiotic pipeline. We urge funding agencies and industry to bridge the growing gap between a well characterized problem and a neglected solution. Graphic abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract For reasons of sustainability and cost efficiency, there is an increasing trend in the steel-processing industry to retrofit existing structures, avoiding costly shutdowns or dismantling. Although welding is a cost-effective joining method, it is rarely applied to old steels, whereas riveted or bolted connections are often uneconomical. Repair and refurbishment frequently require the replacement of damaged material or the creation of dissimilar old–new steel joints. Due to the varied manufacturing processes of historical steels, not all twentieth-century steels are inherently weldable, making an initial assessment of weldability essential. In this study, a historical non-deoxidized mild steel (produced by Siemens–Martin processing) originating from the construction of the Berlin Radio Tower (erected in 1926) was investigated using dilatometry to analyze its welding behavior. A database of welding CCT diagrams and HAZ simulations was established to support practice-oriented welding experiments, providing key insights into their weld-metallurgical behavior and weldability. Furthermore, initial welding trials were conducted, and the local residual stress states in dissimilar old–new steel joints were determined. These foundational investigations are critical for the development of innovative, load-adapted welding concepts for the repair and refurbishment of existing old-steel infrastructure in Germany.",

    "Abstract": "In their recent study, Zhang et al. (Aging Clin Exp Res, 2025) report an association between a composite unhealthy lifestyle score and the risk of comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and arthritis in the CHARLS cohort. While the topic is of significant public health relevance, we have identified several substantive methodological and interpretative limitations that temper the conclusions. Chief among these are the oversimplified and unvalidated definition of lifestyle exposures, particularly \"unhealthy diet,\" and the equal weighting of disparate risk factors without biological justification. Crucially, the analysis fails to adequately control for body mass index, a potent confounder and likely mediator in the T2DM-arthritis pathway. Furthermore, the aggregation of all arthritis subtypes obscures potentially distinct etiologies, and the assertion of \"synergy\" lacks formal statistical interaction testing. Finally, the study remains purely associational, omitting mechanistic investigation into proposed pathways like inflammation. Future research must address these limitations through precise exposure measurement, rigorous confounding control, disease subtyping, and formal mediation analyses to translate this epidemiological observation into causal insight and actionable prevention strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Many mathematics education scholars agree that university mathematics needs to do a better job of supporting equitable classroom practices. While prior work has described the beliefs of university instructors who are relatively unsupportive of equitable instructional practices, there is relatively little work exploring the perceived barriers of instructors who are amenable towards these practices. In this interview study, seven mathematics graduate teaching assistants described their perceived barriers to implementing equitable practices, in the form of culturally relevant pedagogical practices, in their undergraduate mathematics classrooms. Ultimately, even if an instructor was receptive towards the goals of a recommendation, they were sometimes unwilling to implement it if they felt it conflicted with other obligations they held. The graduate teaching assistants described three types of obligations that restricted their ability to implement various recommendations in service of equitable instruction: institutional obligations, an obligation to safeguard students’ wellbeing, and an obligation to respect student agency and feedback. These perceived tensions highlight the role of broader institutional and societal barriers and how they may constrain university instructors even if they are amenable towards equitable practices.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Understanding human mobility is vital to solving societal challenges, such as epidemic control and urban transportation optimization. Recent advancements in data collection now enable the exploration of dynamic mobility patterns in human flow. However, the vast volume and complexity of mobility data make it difficult to interpret spatiotemporal patterns directly, necessitating effective information reduction. The core challenge is to balance data simplification with information preservation: methods must retain location-specific information about human flows from origins to destinations while reducing the data to a comprehensible level. This study proposes a two-step dimensionality reduction framework: First, combinatorial Hodge theory is applied to the given origin–destination (OD) matrices with timestamps to construct a set of potential landscapes of human flow, preserving imbalanced trip information between locations. Second, principal component analysis (PCA) expresses the time series of potential landscapes as a linear combination of a few static spatial components, with their coefficients representing temporal variations. The framework systematically decouples the spatial and temporal components of the given data. By implementing this two-step reduction method, we reveal large weight variations during a pandemic, characterized by an overall decline in mobility and stark contrasts between weekdays and holidays. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in uncovering complex mobility patterns and its potential to inform urban planning and public health interventions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In this study in German higher education, we draw on the first panel of dataset from a longitudinal assessment of domain-specific (DOM) Critical Online Reasoning (COR) in economics in the winter terms 2023/24 (t0) and 2024/25 (t1). DOM-COR tasks were completed as a digital assessment, combining open web search, information evaluation, and reasoning to solve domain-specific scenarios. For this, many students used Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots employing Large Language Models (LLMs). This offered a natural quasi-experiment in a real-life learning setting to compare students’ DOM-COR performance with and without LLMs. Students also reported on LLM-tools use for study and everyday purposes as well as on their learning outcomes (e.g., credit points, exams). This study investigates both the relationships between LLM-tools use and students DOM-COR assessment performance as well as their learning outcomes at universities. We explicitly distinguish between the qualitative indicators of learning and the speed thereof in the context of LLM-chatbots use. By comparing the time students spent completing DOM-COR tasks and their performance between LLM-users and non-users, we examine if, and to what extent, LLM-users had an advantage. While LLM-users were faster, they did not perform better on written task responses. The relationships with learning outcomes trend in the same direction, indicating that regular LLM-users passed more exams, but did not appear to achieve better grades. The findings point to opportunities and risks when using LLM for domain-specific COR-like tasks as well as for regular study assignments.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Entanglement detection, the process of verifying quantum entanglement is a fundamental challenge in quantum information processing. Various approaches have been proposed to address this challenge, with many recent studies applying supervised machine learning methods. While these methods have demonstrated high accuracy in entanglement detection, it is reasonable to assume that the entangled states themselves are not definitively known. To address this limitation, we have devised a machine learning method for entanglement detection based on positive-unlabeled learning, a classical machine learning framework that does not use label information from negative data. Using a deep neural network model to synthetic dataset under the assumption of mixed states, we conducted experiments on a classical computer to valid the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed method. Our approach introduces a novel framework that accounts for the data generation constraints in the training process of entanglement detector, thereby advancing machine learning techniques in quantum information science.",

We present a similar distribution, the GGL distribution, which also fits data well, but is much more tractable and so has a broad range of uses. The distribution function is simple, and hence so is random number generation and the computation of quantiles and expected shortfall. We describe the properties of the new distribution, and show that it fits long-tailed data comparably to the t-distribution, with the advantage that all moments and the moment generating function exist. It can also fit short-tailed and even bimodal data, enabling a parametric test for bimodality.It also yields a test of goodness of fit for logistic regression, a generalised version of logistic regression, and a generalised growth-model.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This work aimed at investigating the effectiveness of a vegetal waste compost (green compost) in improving the quality of a degraded agricultural soil with a low organic carbon content, low microbial activity and co-contaminated by copper and an antibiotic (AB) mixture (sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and chlortetracycline). The soil was planted with Lactuca sativa L. and its growth was evaluated in presence/absence of the green compost in soil microcosms. Physico-chemical (e.g. pH, temperature, organic carbon and contaminants) parameters, microbial abundance (DAPI counts) and enzymatic activities (dehydrogenase, phosphatase and β-glucosidase) were integrated in a soil quality index (SQI). Moreover, microbial biodiversity (NGS) and possible presence of antibiotic resistance genes (qPCR) were investigated in the soil microbial community. The SQI results showed the effectiveness of the green compost in increasing soil quality and fertility. In fact, the lettuce growth (total biomass, leaf area, leaf number and root elongation) was significantly improved. Although antibiotics were inhibiting growth, the soil plant-microbiome system was partially able to counteract the negative effects of these contaminants. Moreover, the soil microbial community showed shifts in some populations under treatments with compost and lettuce. Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were promoted in AB and copper presence with the highest values in the bulk soil. Interestingly, the green compost promoted not only the highest plant biomass, but also the lowest ARG values. The green compost proved to be a good solution for recycling waste, increasing the organic carbon, microbial activity and fertility of the degraded soil and limiting the spread of ARGs (unlike agro-zootechnical organic amendments, e.g. manure).

    "Abstract": "Abstract The sustained application of straw-derived biochar (BC) demonstrates considerable potential for enhancing soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in agricultural systems, though its efficacy is strongly influenced by soil properties, climate, and other environmental factors. We conducted an 11-year outdoor column experiment involving BC application (11.3 t ha −1 ) under strictly controlled climatic and water–fertilizer conditions to examine the effects of successive seasonal BC application on SOC sequestration across three soil parent materials (Quaternary red clay, Tertiary red sandstone, and Yellow River alluvium) and two land-use types (paddy and upland) in China. Results showed that the joint effect of land use and parent material determines SOC sequestration efficiency of BC. Paddy soils exhibited significantly greater SOC storage, 66–323% higher than that in upland soils under identical parent material conditions. In paddy soils, recalcitrant carbon contributed a larger proportion to SOC changes than in upland soils following long-term BC application. Land use modulated microbial responses to BC: paddy soils showed higher ratios of Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacteria (G + /G − ) and lower fungal-to-bacterial ratios (F/B), whereas upland soils displayed the opposite trend, particularly under Quaternary red clay and Tertiary red sandstone. G + /G − and F/B ratios correlated positively with O-alkyl and alkyl carbon and negatively with aromatic carbon, underscoring their critical role in shaping SOC composition. Soil parent material markedly influenced microbial necromass carbon accumulation under BC amendment. Specifically, Quaternary red clay and Yellow River alluvium enhanced microbial necromass accumulation, particularly fungal-derived carbon, indicating that acidic clay loam and slightly alkaline silt loam soils are more conducive to long-term SOC stabilization. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing site-specific BC application strategies to enhance SOC sequestration. Graphical Abstract",

We explore this question through the lens of political economy in political sociology and heterodox economics, based on a review and discussion of key contributions to the literature. We first take stock of the changes in the economic policy governance framework in EMU since its inception, with a particular focus on the ECB, to discuss the extent to which recent transformations since 2020 potentially represent a shift away from the initial “stability” paradigm towards one more concerned with redistributive and climate objectives. We then discuss the issues raised by these changes, reflecting on the interactions between monetary and fiscal policies, on the independence and politicisation of the ECB, and on the desirable degree of financialisation in EMU. Finally, we discuss possible changes to the economic policy governance framework in response to these challenges. We conclude that further reforms are needed for EMU to be fully fit to address the climate challenge.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract As an adjunctive intervention to mechanical periodontal treatment, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy aims to induce the production of reactive oxygen species, thereby reducing microbial infection. Butyl toluidine blue O, a novel photosensitizer from the phenothiazine family, was developed through physicochemical modifications of the structure of toluidine blue, demonstrating decreased aggregation and increased singlet oxygen production and lipophilicity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of butyl toluidine blue O on Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans biofilm. A biofilm was grown on bovine dental samples, followed by the application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. The experimental design included the following groups: Control, Light, incubation with PS without irradiation (0), and three aPDT groups (1, 3, or 5 min of irradiation time duration). A laser with a wavelength of 660 nm and 100 mW of radiant power was employed. After the procedures, the samples were cultivated under microaerophilic conditions, counted, and converted into colony-forming units for analysis and comparison. The samples exhibiting statistically significant differences were analyzed through scanning electron microscopy. Antimicrobial photodymanic therapy with 5 min irradiation period achieved a 99.99% reduction in biofilm microbial load. In conclusion, the approach mediated by butyl toluidine blue O demonstrated efficacy against A. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Analytic interpretations of philosophical texts typically aim to identify their key claims and analyze logical relations among these claims. This technique seems universally applicable. Filippo Casati follows this technique when he argues, in Heidegger and the Contradiction of Being , that Heidegger is committed to contradictory claims about Being, but that this should not be judged a flaw because paraconsistent logical systems can allow for contradictions. However, Heidegger thinks that propositions and all types of formal logic depend on a non-propositional “disclosedness.” He adopts various strategies to indicate this phenomenon while warning us against taking his thought as a set of propositions. Mainstream analytic thinking is thus intrinsically at odds with Heidegger’s thinking. This conflict may lead us to reflect on the nature of truth and philosophy.",

    "Abstract": "Geothermal energy has expanded rapidly worldwide, but declining reservoir pressures pose a challenge to its long-term sustainability. Supplementing reservoirs with surface water offers a potential solution. However, the environmental and operational impacts of such injections remain poorly understood, limiting effective management strategies. In this study, we developed a multiphysics modeling framework integrating heat transfer, fluid flow, and geochemical reactions to simulate the hydrochemical and porosity evolution in geothermal reservoirs under transient surface water injection. We identified distinct thermal, hydraulic, hydrochemical, and porosity influence zones around the injection well and quantified their spatiotemporal evolution. Results revealed time-dependent expansion of impact zones, shifts between dominant mineral dissolution and precipitation regions, changes in water quality, and accumulation of carbonate scales that reduced porosity by up to 0.03 % within 0.15 m of the well. These insights can guide water source selection, injection management, and production strategies, improving injection efficiency while mitigating clogging risks. This study provides a framework for assessing environmental and operational consequences of surface water injection in geothermal reservoirs, supporting sustainable geothermal resource management.",

    "Abstract": "Algal blooms, intensified by eutrophication, pose persistent ecological challenges in aquatic systems. This study investigated the transformation of phosphorus (P) in lake surface sediments under anaerobic conditions using microcosms amended with varying amounts of Lyngbya, a cyanobacterium, to evaluate the impact of algal biomass. Phosphorus pools were monitored via sequential extraction and microbial communities were characterized through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results showed that higher algal biomass loadings markedly enhanced P solubilization and mineralization, leading to a significant increase in total extractable P. Sequential extraction further indicated a shift from mineral-bound P to more labile forms over time, particularly in treatments with elevated biomass loadings. Solution <sup>31</sup>P NMR confirmed the dominance of orthophosphate and a decline in monoester-P, suggesting active microbial turnover of organic P. Sediment chemistry analyses revealed an increase in Fe(II) and a shift toward more reducing conditions, implying reductive dissolution of Fe minerals that may contribute to subsequent release of Fe-bound P. Microbial community analysis highlighted Firmicutes dominance after long-term sediment incubation with high algal biomass input, along with considerable enrichment of anaerobic fermenters and Fe(III) reducers within this phylum. Furthermore, predictive microbial metabolic function profiling recognized possible pathway shifts due to high biomass loading, promoting organic matter fermentation and enhancing P solubilization. Collectively, these findings underscore the role of algal detritus in reshaping sedimentary P dynamics and offer new insights into internal P cycling mechanisms that may guide eutrophication management yielding long lasting effects.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Botanical supplements occupy a regulatory grey area between food and medicine within the European Union, a situation that has given rise to a series of interrelated challenges. This paper highlights regulatory dysfunctions across several dimensions: definitional voids in EU food law, unclear food–medicine classification boundaries, fragmented market access rules, and inadequate safety monitoring systems. These regulatory gaps impose costs on business operators, restrict consumer access, and result in uneven protection across Member States. The article also focuses on safety concerns, which are, however only one element of this broader puzzle. To address such systemic difficulties, the paper proposes the introduction of harmonised pre-market notification and post-market surveillance mechanisms, with a specific focus on botanical supplements. These measures could help reconcile market accessibility with stronger consumer protection while supporting innovation. Admittedly, they may not resolve all regulatory challenges, particularly the thousands of health claims that remain on hold. Nevertheless, they might offer a practical foundation for addressing long-term, often overlooked safety concerns related to botanicals. It remains to be seen whether they could also contribute to resolving the interconnected regulatory issues in this sector, potentially paving the way for broader reform.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives: Screening tools for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) help to identify individuals likely to have ADHD. Several screening scales are used for identifying adults with ADHD, based on criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). The ADHD symptoms described in the DSM were originally developed to describe the behaviours of children, not adults, and focus on the triad of symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Clinical research and experience, however, have revealed additional dimensions of adult ADHD, such as hyperfocus, racing thoughts, emotional lability, impaired sleep, and differences in time perception. Commensurate with the conditions’ growing recognition, the adult ADHD presentation requires rethinking. Methods: To understand better the ADHD symptomatology experienced by adults, qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 diagnosed adults. Results: Using thematic analysis, nine themes of adult ADHD symptoms were identified. The first three themes map to the original triad of symptoms – attentional difficulties, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. A further three themes identified are briefly mentioned in the DSM – disorganisation, forgetfulness, and reduced activation. The final three themes are covered to some degree in the current rating scales but are absent from the DSM 5 – emotional lability, sleep difficulties, and time perception difficulties. Conclusions: This study highlights nine themes relevant to adult ADHD, six of which are absent from the DSM 5’s triad. This research highlights gaps in current assessment tools and suggests symptoms that are more reflective of the adult experience of having ADHD.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Coal balls are our primary source of information about Pennsylvanian tropical peat swamps. They capture plant community composition and the complex ecological interactions between coeval terrestrial arthropods and plants. A small number of borings (or feeding tunnels) have been documented in permineralized and compression fossils from the Carboniferous Period. We report two borings filled with coprolites (fecal material) in a coal ball originating from the Mt. Rorah Coal Member (Tradewater Formation; Middle Pennsylvanian of Illinois, USA). Peels of the coal ball were prepared using the cellulose acetate peel method and digitized with a Zeiss Axio Zoom V16 microscope. The borings, measuring 3 cm and 6 cm in length, follow the transverse margin of Psaronius roots and are filled with two distinct types of uniformly shaped coprolites: type 1, ranging from 0.5–2 mm in diameter, and type 2, &lt;60 μm in diameter. Both coprolite types consist of digested Psaronius root tissue and only occur in borings, with no signs of feeding damage observed in the surrounding plant tissues along the margins of the borings or the peel. The dimensions of the borings and morphology of type 1 coprolites suggest they were made by an early roachoid, millipede, or another terrestrial arthropod group. The distribution and content of type 2 coprolites indicate coprophagy, or secondary feeding on type 1 coprolites, likely by oribatid mites. These borings provide new insight into the life history of the organisms that created these tunnels, their role in litter decomposition, and the food webs of Pennsylvanian peat swamps.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Prenatal exposure to polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has been associated with child weight at birth and may have a persistent effect on adiposity development across childhood. Fish is the richest source of n-3 PUFAs within the diet; albeit few studies have investigated associations between maternal fish consumption during pregnancy and child weight. This study examines associations between maternal fish consumption and prenatal PUFA status (n-3 and n-6), with longitudinal measures of child weight in the high-fish-eating Seychelles Child Development Study Nutrition Cohort 2. Maternal fish consumption during pregnancy was assessed using a Fish Use Questionnaire administered at 28-weeks’ gestation. Serum PUFAs were quantified in maternal blood collected at 28-weeks’ gestation and in cord blood collected at delivery. Birth weight was measured at delivery and classified according to WHO growth standards (n=1185). Child length/height (m) and weight (kg) were recorded at 20 months (n=1182), 7 (n=1167) and 13 (n=878) years. Child BMI was classified according to child z-scores. Maternal total fish consumption (range: 0.0-584.71 g/day) was not associated with child weight at any age. At 7 and 13 years maternal total n-6 PUFAs were associated with an increased risk of overweight/obesity (7yr; OR=1.62, p =0.037, 13yr; OR=2.05, p =0.005). Lower (&lt;0.071mg/ml) cord docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) concentrations were associated with a greater likelihood of being large for gestational age (LGA; &gt;90 th percentile) when compared to higher (&gt;0.129mg/ml) cord DHA concentrations (OR 4.17, p =0.017). This study suggests prenatal maternal n-3 and n-6 PUFA status may influence postnatal outcomes, including child adiposity from birth until adolescence.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Fruit flies are the most serious problem in fruit production worldwide, causing severe losses in production and fruit quality. The use of parasitoids, especially Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera, Braconidae), is an important tool for suppressing the fruit fly population. The objectives of this study were to determine the exposure time, density, and ideal larval instar of Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) and to verify whether the parasitoid’s previous experience affects its interaction with the host insect and the influence of these factors on the parasitism rate. In three bioassays, fly larvae were placed in ‘parasitism units’ to test different methods of exposure to female parasitoids. The variables included the previous experience of the female parasitoid with oviposition, the exposure time (30, 60, 120, 240, and 480 min) of the larvae to the parasitoid and the number (5, 10, 15, and 20) and instar (second and third) of the fly larvae. The flies and parasitoids that emerged were quantified, and the parasitism rate and sex ratio of the parasitoids were calculated. The results of the present study indicate that to increase the parasitism rate of D. longicaudata , third-instar larvae of C. capitata must be grouped into parasitism units of 20 larvae and exposed to a single female of the parasitoid for 8 h.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract While European integration has transformed national parliaments, its long-term impact on conflicts between governments and opposition parties remains insufficiently understood. This study addresses that gap by analysing how Sweden’s accession to the European Union (EU) in 1995 altered the patterns of parliamentary opposition. Using longitudinal data on government proposals in the Swedish parliament, 1970–2022, we apply a difference-in-differences design to compare opposition intensity before and after accession. Our findings reveal two major transformations. First, we identify a sustained decline in opposition in internationally embedded economic and tax policies, supporting the view that the EU political system structurally depoliticises economic governance. Second, we observe a gradual but pronounced politicisation in policy areas tied to national identity and social welfare, where EU competences are limited and domestic discretion remains. We thus find that European integration reshapes parliamentary conflict by dampening opposition in economic policymaking while intensifying contestation in policy areas related to national identity and social protection. Rather than reducing opposition overall, EU membership redirects it across issue areas. Taken together, the results show that the distribution of national and supranational competences conditions parliamentary opposition. As Sweden is a most likely case of EU-induced cleavage transformation, similar dynamics are likely across other member states as well. The study advances parliamentary research by shifting attention from formal powers and debates to observable opposition behaviour over time. It also adds to theories of modern-day cleavage formation by providing evidence that European integration reduces conflict in economic policy while intensifying identity-based divides.",

    "Abstract": "Bile acids are essential steroids with a wide range of biological roles, including the regulation of immunity, nutrient absorption, insulin signaling, appetite, and body temperature. However, due to similarities in their MS/MS spectra, spectral matching with reference MS/MS libraries generally fails to differentiate between isomers. This study introduces a proof-of-concept workflow that uses a mass spectrometry query language filtering tree to distinguish isomeric bile acids in untargeted LC-MS/MS data by leveraging intensity ratios of ions that are close to one another in the MS/MS spectrum. It can be retrospectively applied to existing LC-MS/MS data in data repositories. The filtering tree concept provides the opportunity to annotate and distinguish previously unknown bile acid isomers across LC-MS/MS data sets. To facilitate the ease of applying these filters to LC-MS/MS data sets, we developed a web-based application that simplifies the stepwise filtering tree workflow, removing the need for coding expertise. Here, we apply the multistep filtering application to a representative public data set, which revealed distinct patterns of bile acids associated with different diet types across diverse mammalian species. We further identified the previously uncharacterized bile acid deoxycholyl-<i>N</i>-acetyl-putrescine, which was elevated in carnivores.",

    "Abstract": "Fluorescence imaging is widely applied in oncology owing to its cost-effectiveness, noninvasiveness, and real-time imaging capability. Many activatable fluorescent probes targeting tumor biomarkers, such as β-galactosidase (β-gal) and viscosity, have been developed. However, the reliance on a single-response mechanism limits their ability to capture the dynamic alterations within tumors during cancer progression and chemotherapy. In this study, we rationally designed and developed ZW-gal, a dual-locked near-infrared (NIR) probe activated by both β-gal activity and viscosity. ZW-gal exhibited favorable photophysical properties, such as a large Stokes shift (125 nm), rapid enzymatic activation (within 2 min), and a strong viscosity-dependent fluorescence enhancement (up to 24.6-fold). Leveraging this dual-responsiveness, ZW-gal successfully distinguished cancer from normal cells, visualized doxorubicin-induced cancer cell senescence, and monitored cell death. In a mouse model of liver cancer, ZW-gal enabled precise tumor localization and identified senescent tumors. Moreover, through in situ spraying, ZW-gal provided real-time surgical navigation, facilitating complete tumor resection. Building on these advantages, ZW-gal represents a powerful tool with broad potential to advance both basic cancer research and personalized clinical applications.",

    "Abstract": "The presence and spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across various habitats have increased the risks of antibiotic resistance, highlighting the urgent need for effective monitoring methods. One key challenge in method development lies in balancing sensitivity, speed, and portability. To address it, a one-step assay targeting the carbapenem resistance gene <i>bla</i><sub>NDM</sub> was developed based on recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with CRISPR/Cas12a. A sensitivity optimization paradigm─MOSAIC (multistrategy optimized sensitive assay via integrated CRISPR/Cas12a)─was proposed, incorporating component optimization, suboptimal-PAM-mediated CRISPR inhibition, and glycerol-assisted phase separation. The glycerol-assisted strategy exhibited the largest enhancement, followed by the suboptimal-PAM strategy and component optimization. When combined, these strategies demonstrated a synergistic effect, yielding greater improvement (10 000-fold) than a single strategy alone. MOSAIC reached a limit of detection (LOD) of 260 copies/μL, comparable to that of qPCR, and enabled faster quantification of <i>bla</i><sub>NDM</sub> at 37 °C within 1 h on a standard plate reader. It achieved 100% diagnostic sensitivity and 95.45% specificity in clinical isolates, and 77.41-99.73% accuracy in environmental matrix-spiked samples, comparable to that of qPCR. It provides a technological foundation for on-site detection of <i>bla</i><sub>NDM</sub> and offers an optimization paradigm and new insights for the development of one-step RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assays targeting various genes.",

    "Abstract": "People of color in the United States are disproportionately and unfairly exposed to air pollution. Equity-oriented scientific evaluations quantifying these disparities often use population-average exposure metrics to capture the overall inequality within a system. Utilizing these metrics involves choices about the exposure input for assessing disparity, the study geography, and the reference population, which are critical to understanding disparities and effectively designing interventions. Here, we use a case study of exposure to fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) from California's agricultural sector to dissect the implications of these decisions. Using a reduced-complexity model and emissions of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and precursors, we compare estimates of racial and ethnic disparities in exposure resulting from different combinations of these methodological choices. The full population distributions highlight differences between disparities at the extremes (e.g., 90th percentile) and at the mean. Additionally, the selection of study geography and reference population can influence the magnitude and relative ordering of exposure disparities. Thus, methodological choices can lead to different conclusions for the same concentration and population surfaces; this can impact not only the findings of an individual study but also have implications for mitigation strategies. We conclude with recommendations for best practices for making, justifying, and communicating these methodological decisions.",

    "Abstract": "The desire to protect aquatic ecosystems and drinking water supplies from the adverse effects of nutrients, trace organic contaminants, and other constituents in municipal wastewater has led to a need for additional treatment, particularly in watersheds with insufficient dilution. Constructed wetlands have emerged as viable alternatives to advanced wastewater treatment processes for effluent polishing due to their low cost and ancillary benefits. Starting in the late 1980s, experiences gained from several decades of operating wetlands in small communities increased confidence that these nature-based treatment systems could be effective and reliable. As a result, investments were made in larger constructed wetlands, with surface areas greater than a million square meters (1 Mm<sup>2</sup>) and flows often exceeding 1 m<sup>3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, on effluent-dominated rivers and as part of potable water reuse projects. More recently, new wetland designs have improved the constructed wetland system performance by taking advantage of sunlight-mediated processes in the water column and microbial processes on subsurface porous media. Research that provides additional insight into contaminant removal mechanisms, demonstrates long-term viability, and further improves treatment performance could expand the application of constructed wetlands to other difficult-to-solve water quality challenges, including the treatment of municipal water reuse concentrate and the mitigation of nonpoint source pollution.",

    "Abstract": "Most microplastics (MPs) in wastewater are retained within the sewage sludge. These MPs enter the soil environment through land application, posing a threat to ecosystems. This study proposes an effective control strategy using alkali pretreatment (pH 10, 5 days) followed by hydrothermal treatment at 180 °C (AHT), achieving a degradation rate of 81.83% for polyethylene terephthalate MPs (PET-MPs) in sludge. AHT promotes the formation and solubilization of key active components in sludge, such as alkalinity, which drives nucleophilic attack, metal ions, which catalyze reactions, and organic matter, which acts as radical donors. These components synergistically disintegrate PET-MPs through hydrolysis and radical oxidation pathways during hydrothermal treatment. Meanwhile, hydrothermal treatment induces polymer chain motion and physical structural disruption, accelerating the penetration and reaction of active components, thereby achieving efficient degradation of PET-MPs. Spectral and high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses reveal that sludge AHT facilitates the transformation of MP-derived dissolved organic matter (MP-DOM) into molecules characterized by low-aromaticity, low-molecular-weight, high-saturation, and high-bioavailability. Concurrently, MP-DOM exhibits low acute toxicity toward aquatic organisms and the immortalized human liver cell line (THLE-2 cells). Therefore, sludge AHT effectively degrades and converts polyester MPs into MP-DOM with low-toxicity, thereby mitigating the risks of sludge-based MPs to ecosystems.",

Since HDMF (4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3(2<i>H</i>)-furanone; Furaneol) 6'-<i>O</i>-malonyl glucoside was detected in strawberries, we hypothesized that strawberry malonyltransferases (FaMATs) acylate HDMF glucoside.

    "Abstract": "For the first time, singlet oxygen was shown to be generated by quercetin and gallic acid under mild conditions (37 °C, pH 7) and exclusion of light. In contrast to kaempferol, quercetin induced its own oxidative fragmentation, yielding protocatechuic acid (3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid) and 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid as the corresponding counterparts. If a 4-molar excess of gallic acid was coincubated, quercetin fragmentation reached 25 mol %, but now also kaempferol gave 7 mol % <i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoic acid. The hydroxybenzoic acids formed always showed the B-ring substitution pattern of the precursor flavonol. This reactive oxygen chemical quenching mechanism initiated by pericyclic cycloadditions was underlined by the use of singlet oxygen released from endoperoxides. Isolation and characterization of a quercetin-methanol solvent adduct pointed toward the parallel occurrence of physical quenching. The importance of singlet oxygen-mediated flavonol degradation in food matrices was verified by the detection of the fragmentation products in minced onion and leek samples.",

Especially peptides gained growing attention in pharmaceutical research due to their biological potency, selectivity, and synthetic accessibility. Among these, amphibian skin secretions were recognized as a rich source of bioactive peptides. In this study, we report the synthesis and analysis of the antioxidant and antimicrobial bioactivities of peptides derived from the skin of caudate amphibians, a largely underexplored group in peptide-based drug discovery. Seven caudate amphibian skin peptides, namely salamandrin-I (<b>1</b>), tylotoin (<b>2</b>), ramosin (<b>3</b>), CCK-TV (<b>4</b>), andricin-I (<b>5</b>), Ad-Cath (<b>6</b>), and infraim-I (<b>7</b>) were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis and analytically characterized. Their antioxidant potential was assessed using a radical scavenging assay, while antimicrobial efficacy was evaluated against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains as well as yeast as a fungal representative. Finally, their structural features were analyzed by molecular dynamics simulations and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Salamandrin-I and CCK-TV exerted the strongest antioxidant potential, while salamandrin-I and ramosin showed distinct antimicrobial activities. These results highlight the therapeutic potential of caudate amphibian peptides as scaffolds for novel bioactive compounds in natural product-based drug discovery.",

    "Abstract": "The use of visible light to catalyze organic reactions has sparked significant interests, particularly in C-H borylation. A notable advancement is the visible-light-induced C-H borylation mediated by Rh complex, i.e., [(NHC)Rh(cod)]. Nevertheless, the fundamental role of light remains poorly understood. To establish the underlying structure-activity relationship, systematic theoretical investigations using multistate complete active space second-order perturbation theory (MS-CASPT2), density functional theory (DFT), and rate constant calculations are performed. For the initial photophysical process, the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) state is first reached in the Franck-Condon region, which is followed by a cascade of nonradiative processes that populate the lowest triplet state with a distorted coordination. Two-step isomerization of 1,5-cod ligand affords a Rh complex coordinated with 1,3-cod. Subsequent thermal reactions, instead of photocatalytic reactions as experiments proposed, dominate the C-H borylation, accompanied by a catalytic cycle involving Rh(I) → Rh(III) → Rh(I) redox changes. Moreover, substrate modulation reveals the pivotal role of Rh-N coordination in facilitating the following C-H activation. This work not only elucidates the underlying reaction mechanism but also offers valuable insights for the improvement of current catalytic systems.",

    "Abstract": "Cyclic peptides have gained interest as potential therapeutics due to their ability to target specific protein-protein interactions and be membrane-permeable. Understanding the sequence-structure relationship of cyclic peptides would greatly benefit their rational design. However, cyclic peptides tend to adopt multiple conformations in solution, and it remains challenging to use experimental techniques such as solution NMR to delineate their structural ensembles: i.e., the different structures a cyclic peptide adopts and the associated populations. Alternatively, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to provide such information. However, MD simulations are computationally expensive and not applicable for large-scale screening. Our group has developed the StrEAMM (Structural Ensembles Achieved by Molecular Dynamics and Machine Learning) computational platform and applied it to predict structural ensembles of head-to-tail cyclized pentapeptides and hexapeptides. However, head-to-tail cyclized peptides can be challenging to synthesize due to low yield and complicated reaction workup and product isolation. Furthermore, head-to-tail cyclized peptides are not compatible with screening techniques like mRNA display. Here, we expand the StrEAMM method to thioether-linked cyclic peptides, a popular scaffold in mRNA display. The trained graph neural network models are able to provide fast and simulation-quality structural ensembles for thioether-linked cyclic peptides. Using these models, we identify four thioether-linked cyclic pentapeptides that are predicted to be the best-structured and subsequently experimentally synthesize and characterize them by solution NMR. We observe general agreement between the predicted structures and the NMR results. Ultimately, we envision that StrEAMM-thioether models can work synergistically with the current mRNA platform to streamline the resource-intensive process of drug discovery and design of cyclic peptides.",

    "Abstract": "Membrane separation is an efficient and energy-saving technology for resource recovery, yet it faces challenges such as low separation efficiency, poor selectivity, and membrane fouling when complex acid leachates containing low-concentration platinum. To address these issues, this study reports a novel antifouling porous membrane based on a poly(vinylidene fluoride)/polyamidoamine matrix for the highly selective recovery of platinum. The membrane was fabricated by in situ cross-linking of <i>N</i>-allylthiourea to form a functional layer, followed by monoethanolamine/NaOH treatment to create a hydrophilic surface, resulting in the final PPAT membrane. The membrane exhibited an outstanding pure water flux of 636.54 LMH·bar<sup>-1</sup> and achieved a high Pt(IV) rejection rate of 96.11% at a trace concentration of 5 mg·L<sup>-1</sup>. In a competitive filtration system, the PPAT membrane demonstrated superior selectivity for Pt(IV) over Cd(II), Cu(II), and Ni(II), with relative selectivity coefficients of 309.66, 114.08, and 106.4, respectively. Combined XPS and DFT calculations revealed that Pt(IV) capture was governed by electrostatic interactions, coordination, and hydrogen bonding. In addition, the XDLVO theory confirmed strong interfacial repulsion between the membrane surface and foulant, enabling the membrane to maintain a stable flux of 459.68 LMH·bar<sup>-1</sup> after three water-bovine serum albumin filtration cycles, highlighting its excellent long-term stability.

    "Abstract": "Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have emerged as a leading platform for mRNA delivery; however, their compatibility with prefilled syringes (PFS) containing silicone oil (SO) as a lubricant remains unexplored. This study investigated the effects of SO on the physicochemical stability and biological activity of mRNA-LNPs under various storage conditions (4 °C, 25 °C, and light exposure). Using polyadenylic acid (Poly A) and enhanced green fluorescent protein-encoding mRNA (eGFP-mRNA) as models, we evaluated particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency (EE%), and transfection efficacy. The results showed that Poly A-LNPs exhibited significant particle size increases and PDI changes at 25 °C with SO, whereas eGFP-LNPs maintained stability under the same conditions, probably because of the mRNA secondary structure enhancing colloidal stability. At 4 °C, both formulations remained stable for 12 weeks, but long-term storage led to a gradual EE reduction. Under light exposure, eGFP-LNPs retained a high EE but suffered severe mRNA degradation, resulting in a near-complete loss of transfection activity. Notably, SO partially mitigated light-induced damage, improving transfection efficiency by up to 6-fold in 100 ppm (ppm) SO-spiked samples. These findings reveal mRNA-dependent LNP-SO interactions and underscore the necessity of evaluating both the physicochemical and functional stability of PFS-based mRNA-LNP formulations.",

    "Abstract": "Lithium metal batteries have gained renewed attention after a recent surge in high-energy battery systems. Lithium metal, known for its exceptional specific capacity and voltage, suffers from dendrite formation, which affects the cell performance and poses a severe safety threat, like internal short circuits and thermal runaway. Artificial solid electrolyte (ASEI) has emerged as an effective strategy to guide uniform lithium deposition, but only a few studies have explored the correlation between the interfacial kinetics and the nucleation behavior at the molecular level. In our work, we developed an inorganic-organic hybrid bilayer protective coating on the lithium anode, enabling over 1000 h of Li/Li symmetric cell cycling at 0.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> (0.5 mAh/cm<sup>2</sup>) with low overpotentials. The impact of this bilayer on the nucleation behavior has been addressed using chronoamperometric studies and a modified SEI model based on S-H classical nucleation. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations revealed the role of bilayer components in homogenizing the lithium flux by decreasing the coordination number of lithium ions and promoting lateral growth. These led to a relatively uniform lithium deposition morphology with better capacity retention of more than 80% after 80 cycles for protected lithium (p-Li)/NMC-622 half-cells cycled at 1.7 C with a high loading of 23 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. Our findings establish the importance of interface engineering in controlling the nucleation kinetics of lithium deposition for the development of high-voltage lithium metal batteries.",

    "Abstract": "Solar-driven electricity generation enables autonomous wearables. Enhancing wearable solar thermoelectric generator (STEG) efficiency requires broadband photothermal materials for synergistic optical and thermal energy concentration. To enhance photothermal performance, we developed a strategy to modify the intramolecular charge transfer capacity by adjusting the ligand charge density. Density functional theory calculations show that this manipulation of the ligand charge density reduces the band gap, resulting in narrow band gaps of 0.715, 0.351, and 0.210 eV for the three coordination polymers (CPs), respectively. This improves solar light absorption and photothermal conversion. Under 1-sun irradiation, the maximum temperature of Cu-BTA (BTA = 1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine tetrahydrochloride) can reach approximately 70.9 °C. Furthermore, after incorporating Cu-BTA into a photothermal film, the film can reach 74.6 °C under irradiation with 1 sun. Importantly, coating the thermoelectric device with the photothermal film enables it to generate a voltage of 98.2 mV under irradiation with 1 sun. Furthermore, the integrated system reflects changes in human body temperature through voltage changes, enabling real-time health monitoring. This work offers a new way for exploring potential applications in wearable devices.",

    "Abstract": "Copper-based nanotherapeutics have emerged as a promising anticancer platform by simultaneously inducing cuproptosis and enabling multimodal therapy. However, their clinical application remains constrained by uncontrolled copper ion release, a complex tumor microenvironment (TME), and insufficient therapeutic penetration. To address these challenges, we developed a multifunctional nanoplatform (BCB) through the integration of baicalein-copper coordinated nanoparticles with a boron-dipyrromethene-derived photosensitizer. BCB exhibited a uniform spherical morphology with an average size of approximately 150 nm, excellent stability, TME-responsive release, and multiple catalytic functions, including peroxidase-like and photodynamic activities. Through synergistic chemodynamic and phototherapeutic actions, BCB effectively depleted glutathione, generated abundant reactive oxygen species, disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, and triggered cuproptosis. In murine melanoma models, BCB plus light irradiation achieved a 75% cure rate, even at low doses. Moreover, BCB exhibited antimigratory properties and bone-penetrating capability, with selective accumulation in intramedullary tumor sites, highlighting its potential for treating bone-metastatic cancers. This multimodal nanoplatform represents a promising synergistic strategy for overcoming current therapeutic limitations in both primary and metastatic tumors.",

    "Abstract": "The recycling challenges of thermosetting polymers and the environmental burden from petroleum-based polymers drive the rapid development of recyclable biobased elastomers. However, cross-linked biobased elastomers face an inherent trade-off between high elasticity and high-throughput recycling: robust elastic recovery requires sufficiently cross-linked topologies, whereas efficient reprocessing favors low cross-linking densities. Herein, we address this dilemma by integrating phase separation modulation with dynamic covalent cross-linking to synthesize biobased thermoplastic elastomers via one-step in situ cross-linking. Using maleic anhydride-grafted ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (M-<i>g</i>-EVA) as the compatibilizer, biobased monomers, epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), and dimer acid (DFA) were in situ polymerized within the ethylene-propylene-diene rubber (EPDM) matrix to form a vitrimer dispersed phase. During thermal mechanical mixing, M-<i>g</i>-EVA was first selectively predispersed in the EPDM matrix. Subsequent in situ polymerization drives the cross-linked ESO/DFA aggregates to localize within the M-<i>g</i>-EVA phase, creating a distinct third phase. Meanwhile, M-<i>g</i>-EVA forms interfacial cross-linking with ESO and physically entangles with EPDM chains, thus constructing a stable multiphase network composed of a \"continuous - interfacial - dispersed phase\". The resulting material demonstrates enhanced elastic performance, featuring excellent room-temperature creep resistance (0.00184%/min), improved low-temperature compression set resistance (14% reduction at -25 °C relative to a traditional commercial TPV with similar hardness), and outstanding cyclic fatigue stability (stress retention rate >97% following 300 loading-unloading cycles). Owing to β-hydroxyester bond exchange and lubricating effect of EPDM, the multiphase polymer can be continuously extruded and reprocessed with high flux, retaining >85% of its mechanical property after 5 reprocessing cycles. In short, this study provides a scalable route to high-performance and recyclable biobased elastomers and offers design insights for sustainable elastomers.",

    "Abstract": "The human dopamine transporter (DAT) is a presynaptic transmembrane protein that facilitates the reuptake of synaptically released dopamine. Several lines of evidence indicate that DAT dysfunction is linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, the lateral membrane diffusion and clustering propensity of DAT are emergent properties that may factor into functional dopamine signaling. The disorder-associated DAT missense mutant A559V undergoes anomalous dopamine efflux (ADE) and increased lateral mobility and diffuse localization. The D2 dopamine autoreceptor short isoform (D2S), a popular antipsychotic target, signaling augments ADE in DAT A559V and may form stable DAT-D2S complexes. Using quantum dot (Qdot)-based single-molecule localization microscopy, we investigated the effect of D2S antagonism on DAT and DAT A559V membrane mobility in transfected HEK-293 cells. Single-color Qdot-DAT tracking shows phenotypic rescue of DAT A559V mobility upon D2S antagonism, while aberrant DAT A559V mobility is insensitive to ADE-linked CaMKII activity. Using two-color Qdot tracking of both the transporter and receptor, we report the first DAT-D2S colocalization lifetime in live cells. We show an increased propensity for both transporter types to colocalize with D2S, without impacting D2S diffusion speed under D2S antagonism. Downregulating D2S activity may stabilize DAT coconfinement in D2S microdomains on the cell surface.",

This approach presents significant advancements and offers a practical and accessible alternative to epitaxial methods. The growth of the ZnSe shell over InAs enhances the chemical stability of QDs and improves their sensing response. Our findings demonstrate that colloidal InAs QD-based sensors show a response of 2.97 to 50 ppm H<sub>2</sub>S gas, which remarkably enhanced to 26 under the same conditions after growing the ZnSe shell and the formation of InAs-ZnSe core-shell QDs.

When employing ternary mixtures of ethanol, toluene, and dichloromethane with various compositions, the well-trained 1D-CNN model achieved high accuracy in the predictions, with an average <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> score of 0.98 in cross-validation. Unlike prior e-nose studies that use GC-MS only as a benchmark for classification or concentration regression, we reconstruct full 2D GC-MS maps directly from QCM time-series by mapping temporal windows of sensor signals into an invertible PCA latent space of GC-MS and applying the inverse transformthereby linking sensor responses to chemically interpretable peak patterns.

    "Abstract": "Non-invasive monitoring of exhaled acetone-a recognized biomarker of diabetes-has offered a promising and convenient diagnostic approach for diabetes. However, conventional optical and metal oxide semiconductor sensors suffer from bulky instrumentation, high power consumption, and poor portability. Metal-organic framework (MOF)-based sensors can overcome these drawbacks but still require improvements in response time and stability. Here, we develop a gate-sensitive field-effect transistor (GS-FET) gas sensor functionalized with a sensitive MOF for ultrafast and noninvasive acetone detection. The MOF serves as a chemical-sensitive gate, modulating the polysilicon channel current, while a solvent-modification strategy promotes the density of edge-unsaturated sites with enhanced adsorption activity, as confirmed by density functional theory. Benefiting from these optimizations, the GS-FET sensor achieves a sub-500 ppb detection limit toward acetone and enables real-time breath analysis when integrated into a portable mobile-linked device. To further improve the practicality and convenience of the gas sensor, we have proposed a data analysis algorithm to predict the concentration of acetone based on the initial response of the sensors within 5 s with high data reliability. This work demonstrates a practical pathway for leveraging MOF-based architectures in ultrafast, noninvasive diabetes diagnosis and provides new insights into the development of high-performance gas sensors.",

    "Abstract": "Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a heme-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first, rate-limiting step of the kynurenine pathway─the oxidation of l-tryptophan to <i>N</i>-formylkynurenine (NFK). IDO-catalyzed depletion of tryptophan levels and accumulation of kynurenine pathway metabolites is an important control mechanism of the immune responses in cells. IDO has been considered as a dioxygenase because two atoms of oxygen are inserted into the substrate. Here, we use LC-MS and NMR to examine the reactivity of human IDO (hIDO) with l-tryptophan (l-Trp) and several other tryptophan analogues. Alongside dioxygenase activity, we identify a concurrent pathway of heme-dependent monooxygenase activity in the reaction of hIDO with l-Trp, leading to the formation of a cyclic 3a-hydroxy-1,2,3,3a,8,8a-hexahydropyrrolo[2,3-<i>b</i>]indole-2-carboxylic acid (HPIC) species. Reaction profiles for the reaction of hIDO with other tryptophan analogues are likewise examined. Formation of HPIC from l-Trp is reproduced in HeLa cells induced to overexpress hIDO, indicating that this dual dioxygenase/monooxygenase reactivity also occurs biologically. Notably, the reaction of hIDO with β-[3-benzo(b)thienyl]-l-alanine (S-l-Trp)─a known inhibitor ─yielded only the cyclic HPIC analogue, suggesting that IDO activity can be selectively directed toward the monooxygenase pathway. Molecular dynamics simulations underscore the critical role of substrate plasticity within the active site of hIDO, while DFT calculations provide a mechanistic rationalization for the observed product distributions. Together, the data demonstrate dual dioxygenase/monooxygenase functionality for human IDO. As the overall gatekeeper for control of tryptophan levels in cells, the findings provide mechanistic information on relevance to therapeutic strategies focused on IDO inhibition.",

    "Abstract": "Lead-based halide perovskites have demonstrated remarkable success in applications such as photovoltaics, photodetectors, and LEDs, owing to their defect tolerance and exceptional optical and electrical properties. However, the major issue of lead toxicity has drawn considerable attention, requiring an appropriate solution for the efficient, sustainable recycling or upcycling of lead halide perovskite precursors. In this study, we present a supramolecular approach to transform 3D perovskites into nonlinear optical hybrid materials by employing crown ethers as symmetry-breaking molecular templates. Robust hydrogen-bonding interactions between the crown ethers and the cationic components of the perovskites enable selective extraction and guided self-assembly of perovskite precursors (lead halides and organic amines) into supramolecular metal-halide hybrid crystals. These hybrids exhibit strong room-temperature nonlinear optical (NLO) responses, as confirmed by polarization-resolved second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements showing a large modulation depth of ∼68%. In addition, the supramolecular crystals display enhanced photoluminescence and improved environmental stability compared with their parent perovskite phases. Notably, upon thermal annealing, they can be reverted to the pristine 3D perovskite phase with restored crystal structure and emission, completing a reversible and byproduct-free recycling loop. This work establishes a sustainable and reversible pathway that couples perovskite upcycling with emergent nonlinear optical functionality, enabling phase-preserving storage and on-demand regeneration.",

Thermal treatment induces directed migration of Ru ions from the fluorite phase to the perovskite-fluorite heterointerfaces and subsurfaces of Sr<sub>2</sub>Fe<sub>1.5</sub>Mo<sub>0.5</sub>O<sub>6-δ</sub>, enabling precise optimization of the oxygen vacancy concentration and the electronic environment of Fe cations inside the perovskite phase at the subsurface, thereby markedly enhancing O<sup>2-</sup>/e<sup>-</sup> conductivity and CO<sub>2</sub> reduction reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR) activity. Impressively, a SOEC supported by an La<sub>0.8</sub>Sr<sub>0.2</sub>Ga<sub>0.8</sub>Mg<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>3-δ</sub> (LSGM, 140 μm) electrolyte and employing the SFM-005Ru@CeO<sub>2</sub> composite with a precisely optimized heterointerface as the cathode delivers an ultrahigh current density of 3.80 A cm<sup>-2</sup> @1.5 V at 800 °C for direct CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis, superior to all previously reported electrodes. It also shows excellent stability over 200 h under harsh operating conditions (750 °C, 1.6 A cm<sup>-2</sup>). This work opens up a new avenue to improve the performance of composite materials in various catalytic systems through precise heterointerface engineering.",

    "Abstract": "The structural diversity of zeolites depends strongly on the use of organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs) that guide their formation. Low-dimensional zeolitic materials, such as layered or chain-like phases, can serve as key intermediates in topotactic condensation pathways, yet the mechanisms governing their formation and transformation remain poorly understood. Here, we report three low-dimensional zeolitic materials, EMM-75P, EM-L01, and EM-L02, synthesized using benzimidazolium cations as OSDAs. Their structures were determined by three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED), including the atomic structure of the OSDAs, revealing their confinement within the framework to shed light on their structure-directing role. The bulky benzimidazolium OSDAs prevent the formation of materials with three-dimensional framework structures and instead direct the formation of low-dimensional zeotypes. Upon calcination, the two-dimensional layered aluminosilicate zeotype EMM-75P undergoes topotactic condensation to form a three-dimensional zeolite, EMM-75, with a previously unreported zeolite framework topology. Aluminosilicate EM-L01 is a 2D analogue of <b>STF</b>/<b>SFF</b> zeolite frameworks and partially condensed to an <b>STF</b>-topology upon calcination, whereas EM-L02, a 1D silicate composed of double 6-ring chains, packed analogous to the <b>CHA</b> zeolite framework, collapses during the thermal treatment. The detailed structural characterization of these three materials provides insights into the mechanism of topotactic condensation and demonstrates how such pathways can lead to new zeolite materials.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Central American agriculture and ecosystems are acutely sensitive to rainfall that spans the spring‐summer growing window, yet most studies still evaluate each season in isolation. Here we demonstrate that, since the 2000s, Central American precipitation anomalies in spring have become more likely to persist into summer‐a shift that single‐season analyses overlook. This lengthened persistence arises from a regime change in which multi‐month “persistent events” now dominate over the previously common “transitional events.” Persistent events are anchored by coupling between warm tropical Atlantic (TA) and cold tropical Central‐Eastern Pacific (TCEP) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies that sustains cyclonic circulation, whereas transitional events rely on rapid TCEP SST reversals that disrupt rainfall anomalies. Strengthened Atlantic influences on Pacific climate since 2000 have prolonged Pacific SST persistence, boosting persistent‐event frequency and extending springtime rainfall anomalies into summer. This cross‐seasonal persistence heightens risks to water, food and biodiversity in Central America.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Magnetic signatures preserved in rocks have long provided insight into Earth's evolution, revealing processes from plate tectonics to the habitability of Earth. While large impacts are known to impose extreme stresses (&gt;1 GPa) and heat that fundamentally alters magnetic records, lower stresses typical of earthquakes have been considered magnetically undetectable. We show that magnetic responses to sub‐GPa stresses can be precisely calibrated, enabling three‐dimensional paleostress reconstructions in rocks—even stresses of just a few MPa can fully reset magnetic signals without heat or deformation. This newly revealed magnetic sensitivity to stress opens a powerful, non‐destructive pathway to detecting paleostress fields in the elastic crust, offering new opportunities for improving seismic hazard assessment, interpreting impact processes, and re‐evaluating magnetic records across Earth and Planetary sciences.",

With high‐temperatures above 65 GPa the eight‐fold coordinated δ ‐MgFe 2 O 4 (Th 3 P 4 ‐type) is stable with Mg and Fe disordered into one site, analogous to that predicted in Mg 2 SiO 4 . While the phase‐boundary slope between the h ‐ and δ‐phases of MgFe 2 O 4 and Fe 3 O 4 differ, the substitution of Fe 2+ and Mg 2+ has little overall pressure effect on the stability of the post‐post spinel phase. This eight‐fold coordinated δ ‐MgFe 2 O 4 is stable at ∼400 GPa lower pressures compared to the predicted δ ‐Mg 2 SiO 4 , suggesting the need for further explorations into the conditions needed to substitute Fe 3+ into δ ‐Mg 2 SiO 4 and the effect of ferric iron on the onset of eight‐fold coordination in super‐Earth mantles.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract A diverse array of sulfur‐containing organic compounds (SOCs) was identified in seasonal snow samples collected from northwestern China, using high‐performance liquid chromatography interfaced with an electrospray ionization high‐resolution mass spectrometer (HPLC–ESI–HRMS). Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the HPLC–HRMS data set classified SOCs into distinct clusters based on their molecular characteristics. Substantial differences in SOC composition were observed between urban (U) and rural/remote (R) clusters. In ESI− mode, the SOCs in the U cluster exhibited higher unsaturation degrees, oxidation levels, and larger molecular sizes than the R cluster. These compounds were likely derived from anthropogenic sources, such as transportation and industry, whereas those in the R cluster exhibited signatures of mixed sources, including biomass burning, cooking‐related emissions, and local biogenetic inputs. In ESI+ mode, SOCs were scarcely detected in the R cluster but were abundant in the U cluster. These compounds were predominantly reduced and unsaturated SOCs, with more than 85% (by intensity) containing one or no oxygen atoms in their elemental formulas. Tentative assignments for these species include sulfoxides, polycyclic aromatic S‐heterocycles, thiols, and sulfides, likely originating from the use and production of heavy oils. Additionally, volatility estimates suggest that the SOCs identified in this study are more volatile than those found in other environmental media. The findings highlight the unique SOCs composition in snowpack of northwestern China, particularly those detected via positive ESI mode, offering new insights into the environmental, climatic, and biogeochemical roles of SOCs.",

    "Abstract": "Exposure to socioeconomic risk factors is associated with heightened social and behavioral difficulties in children. Yet, little is known about how cumulative socioeconomic disadvantages affect the development of social-behavioral difficulties, that is, whether the differences in such difficulties between socioeconomic risk groups change over time. It is also empirically unexplored whether specific parenting behaviors mediate the associations between cumulative socioeconomic risk and the changes in social-behavioral difficulties. Drawing on a latent growth curve analysis of data from the German National Educational Panel Study-Starting Cohort 1 (<i>N</i> = 1,842/1,881), this study examined developmental trajectories and group differences in the development of various social-behavioral difficulties (peer problems, hyperactivity/inattention, and conduct problems) for 5- to 9-year-olds growing up with different numbers of socioeconomic disadvantages (i.e., parents' low education level, low income, and migration background). Furthermore, parents' early socioemotional sensitivity in parent-child interaction and their disciplinary parenting behaviors were modeled as mediators linking cumulative socioeconomic risk and the development of children's social-behavioral difficulties. Results showed that the significant gaps between different socioeconomic risk groups at age 5 remained consistent over time for peer problems and hyperactivity/inattention, but converged for conduct problems. Different parenting behaviors partially mediated the effect of cumulative socioeconomic risk on the initial levels, but not on the development of children's social-behavioral difficulties. Practical implications for early prevention programs are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2026 APA, all rights reserved).",

    "Abstract": "Guided by developmental psychopathology and evolutionary developmental psychology models, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of executive functioning (EF) in associations between neighborhood harshness and adolescent internalizing symptomology, for youth who both were and were not exposed to child maltreatment. Data were obtained from a sample of 234 children (52.3% male; 59.2% Black/African American, 12.4% White, 9.2% Latine/Hispanic, 13.7% biracial or multiracial, 5.6% other race) who were recruited from an urban region to participate in a longitudinal study beginning at, approximately, 4 years old. The present study included data collected at age 9 and age 11 timepoints. Child maltreatment data were coded from Child Protective Services records. Results showed that child maltreatment occurring birth through early adolescence was not directly associated with adolescents' EF. EF moderated the association between harsh neighborhood contexts and prospective internalizing symptomology for adolescents with and without exposure to child maltreatment. In addition, the pattern of results was significantly different for adolescents with and without maltreatment exposure. Lower EF scores were associated with fewer internalizing symptoms for adolescents with maltreatment exposure who were living in harsh neighborhoods. Moderation results differed by type of EF task. Overall, findings underscore the need to approach research on early life adversity and the development of psychopathology from an adaptation-based perspective, and to consider the impact of neighborhood context on the development of internalizing psychopathology during adolescence.

    "Abstract": "Adolescents' ethnic-racial identity, including their beliefs about their ethnic-racial group, are shaped by their social contexts. One important ethnic-racial identity belief is public regard, which reflects adolescents' perceptions of their ethnic-racial group's social standing; however, limited research explores how school-based forces inform ethnoracially minoritized adolescents' public regard. Accordingly, the present study examined the interrelations among school discrimination, school belonging, and public regard over the course of a school year among Black, Asian American, and Latine adolescents (<i>n</i> = 2,060; <i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 15.91, 46% boys, 54% girls or another gender). Findings suggested that across the three ethnic-racial groups, higher beginning-of-year school belonging was associated with higher public regard over the course of the school year, whereas higher beginning-of-year school discrimination was associated with lower public regard over the course of the school year. Drawing on an ecological systems framing, we also explored whether these relations were bidirectional, and we found that higher beginning-of-year public regard was associated with higher school belonging over the course of the school year, but beginning-of-year public regard was not associated with later reports of school discrimination. We did not find differences in the strength or significance of any of these relations across ethnic-racial groups. Our findings highlight the important role of school contextual factors in the evolving ethnic-racial identity beliefs of adolescents from ethnoracially minoritized backgrounds.

    "Abstract": "We illustrate the use of exploratory latent class analysis (LCA) in item development or item adaptation. In particular, we focus on the use of LCA as a method for justifying the assumption that the target construct reflects a latent continuum, a key assumption in both classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT) analyses. We show how LCA statistics, in particular contrasts of predicted probabilities for each item based on the logic of Kelley's discrimination index, are informative about whether items behave in a manner consistent with the assumption of a latent continuum. LCA is particularly valuable because it makes relatively minimal assumptions and can cope with important design issues, such as planned missingness or mixed item types, that confound CTT. Moreover, LCA output is understood more readily by nontechnical stakeholders such as content experts, teachers, or clinicians than the results of most IRT analyses. For simplicity, we focus on binary scored test items, although extensions to polytomous data are not difficult. To illustrate, we use simulated data that mimic two pilot studies of a prototype mathematics assessment. Our code is available for readers who want to run their own examples.

Drawing on resource allocation theory, we explore the factors that influence training-induced changes in leaders' MH-related knowledge and self-efficacy following participation in the 3-hr long Mental Health Awareness Training (MHAT; Dimoff et al., 2016). Using multisource, multiwave data from 83 leaders and their followers (<i>n</i> = 383) from 13 organizations, we confirmed that leaders were more knowledgeable of and felt more confident to promote mental health in the workplace following MHAT. Furthermore, leaders' learning goal orientation (LGO) predicted this increase in MH-related self-efficacy, but not in MH-related knowledge. The relationship between LGO and self-efficacy changes was not moderated by leaders' pretraining MH-supportive behaviors but was positively moderated by organizational climate of MH openness. Neither moderator had an effect on the relationship between leader LGO and changes in MH-related knowledge. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings in relation to reaping the benefits of MH-focused leadership training.

    "Abstract": "Abstract The brain is a highly complex, multicellular organ composed of diverse neuronal and nonneuronal cell types that function in concert to maintain central nervous system homeostasis. Among the glial populations, astrocytes are critical regulators of neuronal function. Under physiological conditions, astrocytes provide essential metabolic support, modulate neurotransmitter release and maintain neuronal health. Traditionally viewed as passive and supporting cells, astrocytes are now recognized as dynamic and responsive elements within the central nervous system. In response to pathological insults, astrocytes undergo significant changes in function, morphology and gene expression—a process known as reactive astrogliosis. Reactive astrocytes acquire heterogeneous characteristics that can contribute to brain disorders via the non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. However, the drivers of this transformation—and their shift from neuronal guardians to potential contributors to pathology—remain incompletely understood. Here we explore the complex, multidimensional roles of astrocytes and how reactive states alter their primary functions. We focus on the dual protective and pathological roles of astrocytes, particularly the transition from healthy to heterogeneous reactive forms, with the aim of understanding their overall impact on the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Physiology Of the WEight Reduced State (POWERS) study is a multi-center clinical trial designed to understand the physiological basis for observed variability in weight regain following intentional weight loss among US adults. The primary dependent variable is weight regain over one year following a 7% or greater supervised weight loss. The overarching design and study organization, along with rationale and history of the POWERS study and outcomes measures are described in accompanying papers. This paper provides the rationale for and description of biospecimens samples that will ultimately inform on the molecular and cellular basis of the physiological variability that contributes to the regulation of energy balance in the weight reduced state. Participants will be 205 healthy adults ( n = 205), aged 25–59 years, with body mass index (BMI) 30- ≤ 40 kg/m 2 . Biospecimens will be collected prior to weight loss (baseline, BL), immediately following weight loss via lifestyle intervention (T0), and then four (T4) and twelve (T12) months after weight loss. Blood will be collected in the fasting state and following a meal challenge designed to induce hormones related to satiety. Weight change from T0 to T12 will be the primary outcome variable. Biospecimens to be collected include plasma, serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), DNA, urine, feces, adipose and skeletal muscle tissue. All samples will be biobanked at each site. This manuscript describes the rationale for the biospecimens chosen to assess contributors to homeostatic mechanisms that drive observed variability of weight regain after weight loss.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder that triggers progressive joint destruction by inducing excessive osteoclastogenesis. Porphyromonas gingivalis ( Pg ), the main pathogenic bacterium involved in periodontitis (PD), is closely related to RA. Pg can secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs), which carry numerous virulence factors. The aim of this study was to investigate whether Pg- derived EVs can be transported and exacerbate bone destruction in RA by promoting osteoclastogenesis and to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved. EVs derived from Porphyromonas endodontalis ( Pe ), which is weakly associated with PD or RA, were used as controls. Pg and Pe EVs interact with osteoclasts after translocating into the marrow and metacarpal joints of mice. In vitro, Pg EVs induce osteoclastogenesis via various components, such as lipopolysaccharide, proteins, lipoproteins, and proteases. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 promote but cannot independently control Pg EV-induced osteoclastogenesis. RNA sequencing and verification experiments further demonstrated that Pg EVs induced osteoclastogenesis by promoting the phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk). In vivo, Pg EVs exacerbated RA-induced bone destruction by activating Syk-dependent osteoclastogenesis. R406, a Syk inhibitor, significantly attenuated Pg EV-induced RA osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction. However, Pe- derived EVs presented an extremely weak ability to promote osteoclastogenesis and RA. Our findings reveal a new mechanism by which Pg EVs can exacerbate RA via transport through the circulation and the promote Syk-dependent osteoclastogenesis. This study deepens our understanding of the significant pathogenic role of EVs derived from oral bacterial in RA and explores targeted therapeutic strategies by inhibiting the activation of Syk.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Stimuli-responsive organic-inorganic metal halides hold great promise for emerging information-related applications. In this work, replacing the free halide ion Cl − with Br − in C 5 H 11 N 3 (MnCl 3 ·H 2 O)X (where C 5 H 11 N 3 2+ represents histamine cation, X represents free halide ions) converts the non-responsive hybrid C 5 H 11 N 3 (MnCl 3 ·H 2 O)Cl into a stimuli-responsive C 5 H 11 N 3 (MnCl 3 ·H 2 O)Br. The latter exhibits reversible photoluminescence color switching between red and green upon thermal or water exposure. Extensive experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the responsive property primarily stems from weakened hydrogen bonding surrounding H 2 O molecules after Br − substitution, which facilitates the initial escape of H 2 O molecules under heating. Subsequent structural reorganization and coordination transformation then induce the change in photoluminescence. Furthermore, the fabricated halide/polymer luminescent films are demonstrated to be highly applicable in multiple scenarios, such as planar temperature sensing, thermal stamping, and encryption/decryption. This study highlights the crucial yet often overlooked role of free halide ions in metal halides and offers new insights into their structure–property relationships.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Cardiorespiratory coupling (cardiovascular-respiratory interactions) is a marker of autonomic nervous system function and maturation. We hypothesize that differences in autonomic maturation are associated with disparate outcomes of premature infants. Methods We collected continuous bedside cardiorespiratory data from birth to 40 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) for 191 preterm infants born between 23–0/7 weeks to 28–6/7 weeks of gestation. Using the respiratory and ECG wave forms, we calculated cardiorespiratory phase synchronization (CRPS) as a measure of cardiorespiratory coupling. Using linear mixed effects modeling, we studied the trajectory of CRPS as a function of PMA and chronological age (CA) and any difference between groups separated by discharge status, respiratory outcome and neurological outcomes at the 40th week PMA, and different gestational ages. Results CRPS showed a decline reaching a nadir at approximately 3 weeks of age followed by a gradual increase toward term. The infants born at later GA showed higher values and steeper increases than infants of lower GA. Contrary to our hypothesis, the trajectory of the increase was similar regardless of outcome assessed. Conclusion Autonomic maturation following preterm birth shows a fixed predictable pattern that appears to be independent of respiratory or neurologic outcomes or clinicians’ assessment of readiness for discharge. Impact Cardiorespiratory phase synchronization (CRPS) trajectories, a marker of autonomic nervous system functio is provided for 175 extremely preterm infants across post-menstrual age (PMA) and chronological age (CA). CRPS initially declines but subsequently increases with advancing PMA and CA, irrespective of discharge status and respiratory and neurological outcomes at 40 weeks PMA. At all CAs after the initial decrease, CRPS was higher for infants born at 27–28 weeks compared to those born earlier.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Metastasis remains the primary cause of mortality in colorectal cancer (CRC), with a 5-year survival rate of ~14%, despite therapeutic advances. SPP1 + tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are implicated in promoting tumor progression, angiogenesis, and immune evasion. Osteopontin (OPN), encoded by the SPP1 gene, is a critical regulator of TAMs M2 polarization and CRC metastasis when derived from TAMs. However, it remains unclear whether CRC-derived OPN interacts with M2-like TAMs to promote metastasis and what the underlying mechanisms are. Here, we found that OPN is highly expressed in metastatic CRC and is associated with poor prognosis. Contrary to prior reports, neither knockdown nor overexpression of OPN in CRC cells directly altered tumor cell invasion and migration. Rather, OPN expression levels were positively correlated with M2-like TAMs infiltration. The co-culture system revealed bidirectional chemotactic interactions between CRC cells-derived OPN and M2-like TAMs. Mechanistically, high OPN expression activates the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in macrophages, promoting the secretion of CSF1, which induces M2-like polarization of macrophages to facilitate tumor metastasis. Finally, in a mouse metastasis model, blocking the CSF1/CSF1R axis with a CSF1R inhibitor reduced the M2-like TAMs recruitment and CRC tumor metastasis burden. Our study demonstrates that the OPN/PI3K/AKT/CSF1-CSF1R axis plays a crucial role in CRC metastasis. Blocking the CSF1/CSF1R axis reduces M2-like TAMs infiltration and tumor metastasis, offering a promising strategy for metastatic CRC.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose To evaluate hyperreflective choroidal foci (HCF) in Sattler’s and Haller’s layers as predictive biomarkers for treatment response and pachychoroid macular atrophy (pMA) development in chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). Methods Retrospective analysis of 70 treatment-naïve patients with recurrent CSC classified according to Chhablani’s criteria. HCF were quantified separately in choroidal layers using spectral-domain OCT at baseline and 12-month follow-up. Patients received photodynamic therapy ( n = 20), eplerenone ( n = 16), or subthreshold micropulse laser ( n = 34). Primary outcomes included treatment response (complete fluid resolution) and pMA development. Results At baseline, no significant differences in HCF counts existed between future responders ( n = 36) and non-responders ( n = 34). At 12 months, responders showed significant HCF reduction in Sattler’s layer (−9.17 foci, p = 0.001) and Haller’s layer (−3.19 foci, p = 0.039), while non-responders demonstrated increased Sattler’s foci (+4.62, p = 0.041). pMA developed in 15 patients (21.4%), more frequently in non-responders (32.4% vs 11.1%, p = 0.001). Baseline total HCF count was the strongest predictor of pMA development (β = 0.465, R ² = 0.324, p &lt; 0.001), with final HCF counts showing even stronger associations (β = 0.512, R ² = 0.348, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Layer-specific HCF quantification provides valuable prognostic information for treatment response and pMA risk in chronic CSC. These biomarkers may guide therapeutic decisions and identify patients requiring closer monitoring for atrophy development.",

While mouse type 1 ILCs (ILC1s) control acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by targeting leukemia stem cells (LSCs), the role of human ILC1s in AML remains largely undefined. Here, we find that ILC1s in AML patients are impaired, with reduced total ILC1 numbers and diminished function. In contrast, healthy donor (HD) ILC1s-derived TNFα inhibits the leukemic transition from CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup> to CD34<sup>-</sup>CD38<sup>+</sup> cells and blocks the differentiation of LSCs (CD34<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>-</sup>) into immunosuppressive, macrophage-like leukemia-supporting cells.

    "Abstract": "Previous studies have noted that cities enhance cloud cover, but the mechanisms of urban morphological types on cloud formation remain elusive. Observations of cloud climatology from 44 major U.S. cities show that cloud enhancement increases with the street-canyon aspect ratio and decreases with building density. Here, to explain these observations, we conducted numerical experiments using urban morphology-resolving large-eddy simulations. In these simulations, urban and rural surfaces retain their respective heat-flux differences, while the moisture sources and background atmospheric water vapor are prescribed to be identical, allowing us to isolate the morphological controls on moist convection. Results show that urban morphology influences cloud formation through two mechanisms: taller buildings intensify urban-breeze circulations at the urban-rural interface, while denser buildings, acting as momentum sinks, reduce vertical turbulent transport at the urban core. These vertical motions modify the transport of moisture in the urban atmospheric boundary layer, causing different cloud amounts across different urban morphology. This study highlights the mechanistic link between urban form, vertical motions, and cloud enhancement, thus providing a basis for city-specific boundary-layer convective parameterizations in large-scale weather and climate models.",

Here, we report a molecular design strategy that remodels electrolyte solvation structures via the formation of hydrogen-bonded domains, thereby enhancing both the thermodynamics and interfacial dynamics of Li<sup>+</sup> transport. Specifically, we introduce 2-cyano-N-methylacetamide, an electrochemically stable hydrogen bond donor, as a cosolvent to construct stable nanoscale hydrogen-bonded domains ( < 3.5 Å). 2-Cyano-N-methylacetamide generates both classical (H-bond, H<sup>δ⁺</sup>-O<sup>δ⁻</sup>) and nonclassical (Z-bond, N<sup>δ⁻</sup>-H<sup>δ⁺</sup>) hydrogen bonding, which disrupts loosely bound solvated clusters and induces tightly coordinated Li<sup>+</sup> solvation structures.

    "Abstract": "Active galactic nuclei (AGN) with broad emission line regions (BLRs) contain rapidly growing supermassive black holes. Their masses are typically derived from BLR gas motions inferred from spectra and BLR sizes estimated from the AGN luminosity. The breathing BLR model predicts that the spectral line width should change as luminosity varies, keeping mass estimates constant. Here, we present observations of an AGN sample at redshift <0.1 with two epochs separated by 20 years. On average, we find that luminosity and mass estimates vary by a factor of 2, showing a long-term mean-reversion pattern, while the line widths remain constant. A constant line width suggests that full BLRs do not change size during continuum or line flux variability, naturally explaining why scaling relations depend on instantaneously measured Eddington ratios. As a result, we find that single-epoch masses with the best repeatability after 20 years are obtained when sizes are estimated from the narrow [OIII] λ5007Å emission line luminosity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Several vascular diseases including coronary artery disease, hypertension, stroke, and abdominal aortic aneurysm, have significant genetic underpinnings. Genome-wide association studies have unveiled many genetic loci associated with one or more of these diseases. However, the causative genes at most of these loci are yet to be determined, which hampers the translation of the genetic findings into a better understanding of the disease mechanisms and the identification of new therapeutic targets. Here, in an integrative functional genomics analysis of these loci, we identify a panel of likely causal genes, some of which are pleiotropic for more than one of these vascular diseases. Pooled CRISPR knockout screen analyses of these likely causal genes indicate that many of them influence vascular smooth muscle cell behaviour, and validation experiments of selected genes confirm that FES , BCAR1, CARF and SMARCA4 exert such effects. Further functional experiments focusing on FES , a pleiotropic gene for both coronary artery disease and hypertension, show that it modulates the expression of genes involved in vascular remodeling and that Fes knockout in mice promotes atherosclerosis as well as raises blood pressure. These findings provide an insight into the genetic basis of vascular diseases and inform targets for therapeutic development.",

    "Abstract": "Alveolar echinococcosis (AE), a chronic parasitic disease caused by Echinococcus multilocularis (E. multilocularis), remains poorly characterized with respect to central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and its long-term effects on mental health have not been systematically investigated. In this study, we established a BALB/c mouse model of chronic E. multilocularis infection and applied an integrative framework combining behavioral assessments, histomorphological analyses (hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, and transmission electron microscopy), cytometric bead array (CBA), and multi-omics approaches (16S rRNA sequencing, metagenomics, and untargeted metabolomics) to investigate infection-induced neuroimmune-gut microbiota interactions. Chronically infected mice exhibited pronounced depression-like behavioral phenotypes, accompanied by hippocampal neuronal nuclear membrane atrophy and disrupted microglial homeostasis. Both peripheral and central inflammatory profiling revealed elevated levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, particularly IL-6 and MCP-1, suggesting coordinated systemic immune activation and neuroimmune alterations. Notably, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from infected donors was sufficient to induce depression-like behaviors in recipient mice, supporting a contributory role of infection-associated gut microbiota alterations in behavioral abnormalities. Integrated multi-omics analyses further revealed a marked reduction in Lactobacillus abundance in infected mice, which was positively correlated with decreased levels of key metabolites within the tryptophan/5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolic pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that chronic E. multilocularis infection may be associated with depression-like behaviors through gut microbiota dysbiosis and related metabolic perturbations. This study provides initial insights into the potential mechanisms underlying neuropsychiatric complications in AE and proposes a conceptual framework for future investigations into early intervention and microbiota-targeted therapeutic strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Thyroid diseases are common and highly heritable. We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies from 19 biobanks for five thyroid diseases: thyroid cancer (ThC), benign nodular goiter, Graves’ disease, lymphocytic thyroiditis and primary hypothyroidism. We analyzed genetic association data from ~2.9 million genomes and identified 313 known and 570 new independent loci linked to thyroid diseases. We discovered genetic correlations between ThC, benign nodular goiter and autoimmune thyroid diseases ( rg = 0.16–0.97). Telomere maintenance genes contributed to benign and malignant thyroid nodular disease risk, whereas cell cycle, DNA repair and damage response genes were associated with ThC. We propose a paradigm that explains genetic predisposition to benign and malignant thyroid nodules. We found polygenic risk score associations with ThC risk of structural disease recurrence, tumor size, multifocality, lymph node metastases and extranodal extension. Polygenic risk scores identified individuals with aggressive ThC in a biobank, creating an opportunity for genetically informed population screening.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Molecules that facilitate protein–protein interactions are immensely impactful. However, such compounds typically rely on accessory proteins to function, such as E3 ligases for targeted degradation, which may restrict their scope or lead to resistance. We alleviate the need for accessory proteins with a strategy that exploits protein symmetry as a selective vulnerability and is widely applicable because of the ubiquitous nature of homomeric proteins. We target homomeric proteins with PINCHs (polymerization-inducing chimeras)—bifunctional molecules composed of two linked ligands that bridge homomers and trigger their supramolecular assembly into insoluble polymers. We design PINCHs that achieve efficient polymerization of four targets. In cells, we observed that a PINCH targeting Keap1 exhibited a longer duration of action and a PINCH targeting BCL6 displayed selective lowering of B cell viability compared to their monomeric parents. Our results highlight PINCHs as a novel and general strategy to modulate and knock out protein function.",

    "Abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder where environmental factors play a predominant role in sporadic cases. While environmental toxins are implicated in PD pathogenesis via epigenetic pathways, the specific alterations in chromatin accessibility induced by these toxins remain poorly characterized. To address this gap, we established in vitro models using the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, a well-established neuronal model, exposed to the PD-associated environmental toxins rotenone and MPP⁺. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to profile the transcriptome and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) to map genome-wide chromatin accessibility landscapes under toxin-exposed conditions. This integrated dataset provides a comprehensive resource detailing both gene expression and chromatin accessibility dynamics in response to PD-relevant environmental neurotoxins and will facilitate investigations into transcriptional regulation, biomarker discovery, and the epigenetic basis of environmentally linked sporadic PD.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract A high-resolution, quantitative dataset of agricultural drought impacts is essential for advancing impact-based drought monitoring and prediction. Yet, such data remain the critical missing piece, representing the major obstacle to developing robust, impact-driven drought assessments. Here, we generated a 500 m-gridded agricultural drought-impacted area dataset in the China’s main grain region (ADIA-CMGR) during 2006–2020. We employ a leaf area index (LAI)-based relative threshold method to extract the areas with three degrees of drought impacts for summer-harvest crops, autumn-harvest crops, and early rice, respectively. The dataset constitutes various information, including drought-covered area , drought-damaged area , and crop failure area . Validation with the text-based qualitative records of agricultural drought-impacted areas shows that ADIA-CMGR offers accurate temporal variability and reasonable spatial distribution. The developed dataset satisfactorily revealed the spatial and inter-annual dynamics of agricultural drought-impacted areas across various crop-growing seasons, providing a solid foundation for managing drought impacts and improving agricultural practices.",

    "Abstract": "Diatoms are abundant unicellular microalgae that play a fundamental role in global aquatic ecosystems, producing bioactive secondary metabolites with different functions, from signalling to defence. They exhibit complex life cycles comprising distinct phases: active growth, quiescence state in some species (with the formation of spores or resting cells), and sexual reproduction. The transition to the quiescent state permits long-term persistence, allowing species to survive under unfavourable environmental conditions. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms governing the switch between growth and quiescent state remain largely unknown. Here, we present the first multi-timepoint sequencing of coding and non-coding RNAs during the formation of resting cells, induced by nitrogen depletion, in the marine diatom Thalassiosira gravida (valid name of Thalassiosira rotula). This dataset provides new omics data associated with the initiation and maintenance of the quiescent state, supporting further investigation of its underlying molecular pathways.",

Currently, there are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs or curative treatments for SCA3. This study aimed to uncover the potential therapeutic mechanism of natural products (NP or NPs) against SCA3 using an integrative computational strategy combining network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, principal component analysis (PCA), free energy landscape (FEL), dynamic cross-correlation matrix (DCCM), and Molecular Mechanics/Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) calculations. A total of 4,986 SCA3-related targets were retrieved from the GeneCards database, and 696 unique NP-related targets were obtained from SwissTargetPrediction and SuperPred databases. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis revealed 239 overlapping targets. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis identified the MAPK signaling pathway (hsa04010) as a key mechanism involving 33 critical proteins, including AKT1, TP53, TNF, EGFR, RELA, and MAPK1. Among the screened compounds, crocin exhibited the highest binding affinities with AKT1 (- 9.5 kcal/mol) and TP53 (- 6.6 kcal/mol) in docking studies. Further validation through MD simulation, PCA, FEL, DCCM, and MM/PBSA analysis confirmed the stability and strong interaction of crocin with these targets. This study highlights crocin as a promising candidate for SCA3 therapy and provides a foundation for future experimental validation.",

    "Abstract": "This study proposes a sustainable high-performance concrete (HPC) incorporating industrial by-products and recycled materials, specifically granulated blast furnace slag and recycled rubber powder, as partial replacements for cement. A series of experimental tests were conducted to evaluate the mechanical performance of the modified concrete, including compressive, flexural, and Brazilian tensile strengths, along with workability characteristics. Results indicate that replacing cement with up to 30% slag resulted in less than 5-10% reduction in mechanical strength, while significantly improving workability. The inclusion of 10% recycled rubber powder enhanced ductility and fracture energy albeit with an associated reduction in compressive strength from 89 to 73 MPa. From an environmental perspective, carbon footprint analysis revealed that cement replacement led to substantial CO₂ emission reductions, with a 42% reduction at 30% slag and up to 37% reduction at 30% rubber content compared to conventional HPC. Life cycle cost analysis further demonstrated that the mix containing 30% slag achieved the highest strength-to-cost efficiency (0.22 MPa/$), highlighting its economic viability. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining slag and recycled rubber offers an effective pathway toward environmentally friendly and cost-efficient HPC, suitable for sustainable construction applications where reduced carbon emissions, enhanced energy absorption, and adequate structural performance are required.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Evolutionary therapy (ET) applies principles of evolutionary biology to steer tumour dynamics and forestall or delay treatment resistance, typically guided by data-driven mathematical models. Our aim is to assess whether ET protocols, and specifically Zhang et al.’s protocol proposed for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer, can be theoretically effective for fast-growing metastatic cancers such as stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Using longitudinal tumour-burden data from NSCLC patients treated with erlotinib, we systematically evaluate 26 two-population differential-equation models based on classical tumour-growth dynamics, with varying assumptions about density- and frequency-dependent interactions, pharmacokinetics, and treatment-induced death. Previous work by Yin et al. on the same dataset employed an exponential model that omitted density- and frequency-dependent interactions; although it provided a good fit to tumour-burden data, its structure would theoretically lead to poorer outcomes under ET protocols. In contrast, our analysis identifies the minimal model structure required to reproduce the resistance-driven regrowth observed in NSCLC, with the Gompertzian model featuring log-kill dynamics and both density- and frequency-dependent interactions providing the best fit. In this model, Zhang et al.’s protocol prolonged median time-to-progression to 42.3 months compared with 24.8 months under maximum tolerated dose. These results indicate that ET is theoretically a viable treatment strategy for NSCLC. This study offers a practical framework for assessing ET feasibility using clinical data and supports future clinical translation of ET in NSCLC.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Brain metastases are common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and affect prognosis and survival. While frailty and sarcopenia are associated with the overall survival in NSCLC the impact on outcome and survival after surgery for brain metastasis is unknown. We therefore analyzed 179 patients (81 women) with NSCLC undergoing resection for brain metastasis between 2011 and 2020 retrospectively. Frailty was measured using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS). Temporal Muscle Volume (TMV) was assessed in preoperative T1w MRI. The median age was 63 years. Clinical frailty was present in about 20.6%. Mean follow-up was 11 months. Frailty correlated significantly with age ( r = 0.36, p &lt; 0.001) and smaller TMV ( r =-0.24, p = 0.002). However, only measurement of TMV predicted impaired survival (median OS 34.5 vs. 10.3 months, p &lt; 0.001). Physical performance after surgery was negatively affected by frailty ( r =-0.72, p &lt; 0.001) and positively by TMV ( r = 0.2, p = 0.038). Major postoperative complications were more strongly associated with sarcopenia rather than frailty. Treatment response towards immunotherapy improved in the absence of sarcopenia (B = 2.48, p = 0.031). TMV is a predictor for survival after resection of brain metastasis and an indicator of treatment response to immunotherapy in patients with NSCLC. Accounting for sarcopenia in surgical decision making could improve patient selection for different treatment modalities.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Optimising coral early life stages, particularly larval settlement, remains a challenge for coral aquaculture. Settlement typically relies on biologically conditioned substrates, such as crustose coralline algae (CCA) or microbial films, which are difficult to scale for mass-production. To overcome this bottleneck, we evaluated chemical and physical alternatives that enable spatial control of directing larval settlement. Larval responses from 14 coral species were tested against known and potential chemical inducers, including neurotransmitters and neuropeptides. Next, we investigated the efficacy of a set of known chemical inducers and microtopography to direct larval settlement. The neuropeptide Hym-248 was the most effective, inducing settlement in seven acroporid species. Embedding soluble inducers (CCA extract and Hym-248) in agar hydrogels within ceramic cubes successfully induced and directed settlement of Acropora kenti . Similarly, CCA-conditioned ceramic protrusions, with and without microtopographic pores, achieved &gt; 99% settlement on or adjacent to protrusions. These findings demonstrate that immobilised chemical cues can precisely localise larval settlement on unconditioned substrates and that conditioning only small, discrete 3-D printed features is as effective as conditioning entire tiles. This approach substantially reduces aquarium space and resource requirements, offering a scalable, cost-effective pathway to enhance the efficiency of sexually propagated coral aquaculture in reef restoration.",

    "Abstract": "This study presents an automated induction brazing system for thin-walled aluminum waveguide assemblies, integrating dual-loop control with real-time positional feedback. Two proportional control strategies were evaluated: a baseline single-loop heating-rate controller and an enhanced dual-loop configuration incorporating active inductor realignment based on thermal asymmetry. The single-loop system, operating at 20 Hz, achieved an average absolute temperature error of 3.4 °C with a 92% success rate, but exhibited sensitivity to workpiece-inductor gap variations, leading to inter-element temperature deviations exceeding 15 °C under moderate misalignments. To address this, a secondary feedback loop was introduced to dynamically correct flange-to-tube temperature differentials, improving thermal uniformity across the brazing zone. Full-scale validation on 120 assemblies across four geometric classes demonstrated that the dual-loop system reduced average temperature error to 2.1 °C, limited peak temperature spread to 8 °C, and increased yield to 97%. The control architecture features distinct bandwidth separation for power and positional loops, minimizing cross-coupling. A modular C++ software environment synchronizes multi-source data streams-including pyrometry, manipulator kinematics, power metrics, and video analytics-with real-time KPI tracking and long-term logging to an SQL-based historian. These results highlight the potential of feedback-driven control architectures in precision thermal joining, and suggest pathways for future enhancements using adaptive or fractional-order control algorithms.",

However, the trophic niche area might be influenced by a variety of biotic and abiotic factors. For instance, water level fluctuation might also affect the trophic niche area of all consumers inhabiting a given aquatic ecosystem. Thus, in this study we investigated the effect of water level fluctuation on the isotopic niche area of multiple consumers (macroinvertebrates and fish) belonging to different trophic guilds (i.e., predator, omnivore, and detritivore) over three years. The results showed that water level fluctuation strongly affects the isotopic niche area of all consumers. Nevertheless, the magnitude and direction were group specific. While predatory fish increased the isotopic niche area when the water level dropped, omnivorous fish experienced a decrease; these two trends continued even after the water level drop. In crayfish, the isotopic niche area was considerably larger during the year with water level drop. However, decreasing water levels resulted in a corresponding decrease in isotopic niche area in detritivores and predatory macrozoobenthos. Our study demonstrated the importance of water fluctuations on the isotopic niche area across different types of consumers.",

The maximum tumor diameter on US (D<sub>US</sub>) and CEUS (D<sub>CEUS</sub>), the maximum stiffness of SWE (Emax), their changes and consistency with the postoperative pathological analysis were evaluated, and their predictive value was compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. 60 patients were included among whom 28 (46.7%) achieved pCR and 32 (53.3%) exhibited non-pCR. The changes in D<sub>CEUS</sub> and Emax were significantly correlated with pCR (p < 0.005). ΔD<sub>CEUS</sub>% differed significantly between pCR and non-pCR groups across all molecular subtypes. However, ΔEmax% differed significantly in ER negative, PR negative and Her-2 negative breast cancer after NAC. The combination of ΔD<sub>CEUS</sub>% and ΔEmax% demonstrated superior predictive ability for NAC response, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.906, outperforming ΔD<sub>CEUS</sub>% (AUC 0.871) or ΔEmax% (AUC 0.722) alone.

First, a collaborative attention mechanism (CADP-SCSA) is designed and incorporated into the feature extraction network to minimize interference from complex backgrounds, effectively enhancing the extraction of multi-scale features within the global context, and improving localization accuracy. Second, a multi-scale feature space pooling module (SPPSCCAP) is designed to enhance the processing and fusion of fine-grained, multi-scale defect features on wind turbine blades. The C2f-SENetv2 module is employed to enhance the representation of features across different channels. Finally, an adaptive slice convolution module (FADown) is designed to effectively reduce information loss during the sampling process. Experimental analysis is performed on the self-constructed wind turbine blade dataset (WTBD818-DET). The proposed algorithm achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 87.7%, which is 10.5% higher than YOLOv8s, and outperforms mainstream detection algorithms such as RT-DETR, YOLOv11s, and Mamba. The experimental results indicate that the algorithm maintains high performance in detecting multi-scale wind turbine blade defects.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study aimed to investigate the relationship between myopia and retinal vascular oxygen saturation, after accounting for optical factors and individual variations. This was a prospective, observational, single-center study. Adults with anisometropia were included. All the participants underwent femtosecond-assisted laser in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK), and before and after the surgery, all the patients underwent the examination of visual acuity, intraocular pressure (IOP), spherical equivalent (SE), average keratometry (K), central corneal thickness, and retinal oximeter. A total of 196 adult patients with myopic anisometropia were enrolled. The SE of the less myopic eyes before surgery was − 3.89 ± 3.24 D, which was significantly higher than that of the more myopic eyes − 6.75 ± 3.10 D ( p &lt; 0.001). The retinal arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ) of the less myopic eyes was 94.08 ± 1.61%, which was significantly higher than that of the more myopic eyes 93.36 ± 1.74% ( p = 0.003). After FS-LASIK, the SaO 2 of the less myopic eyes (93.29 ± 1.72%) remained significantly higher than that of the more myopic eyes (92.76 ± 1.83%) ( p = 0.038). In the multivariate regression analysis, the postoperative SaO 2 was still significantly negatively correlated with axial length (AL) ( B = -0.252, P = 0.009). After excluding optical factors and individual variations, SaO 2 remains negatively correlated with AL. Myopia exerts an optical magnification effect on SaO 2 .",

    "Abstract": "Reprogramming of cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, particularly ovarian cancer (OC), that contributes to rapid cancer growth and survival. However, studies using clinical specimens are limited. To identify metabolic alterations specific to OC, we performed metabolomic analysis of OC and benign ovarian tumors. The relationship between metabolomics and transcriptomics was investigated by transcriptome analysis. Fifty-one patients with OC and three with benign ovarian tumors, diagnosed between 2011 and 2014 using available frozen tissue and plasma specimens, were enrolled at the National Cancer Center Hospital. To identify metabolic alterations, plasma samples from 51 patients with OC and three with benign tumors, along with both cancerous and non-cancerous tissue samples from 44 of the 51 patients with OC, were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. In addition, we performed transcriptomic analysis of cancerous tissues obtained from 39 of the 44 patients with OC. It was not possible to classify patients based on plasma metabolite levels; therefore, the 44 patients with OC were classified into two groups based on metabolite levels: high and low, based on tissue analysis. The group with high metabolite levels had more advanced-stage tumors (P = 0.02). Transcriptome pathway analysis revealed suppression of pathways related to natural killer (NK) cells and immune responses in the group with high metabolite levels. NK cell percentages were lower in the group with high metabolite levels than in the group with low metabolite levels (P = 0.04). Thus, the group with high metabolite levels was associated with advanced stages and a reduced fraction of NK cells, suggesting that high metabolite levels may play a direct or indirect role in immune activity or in the malignant progression of OC.",

    "Abstract": "Prostate cancer is always regarded as 'we' disease with unavoidable influence within the couples, particularly during the early post-diagnosis period. Thus, this qualitative research is to explore the psychosocial experiences of prostate cancer couples coping within six months of diagnosis in China. The study was conducted through semi-structured interviews between June 2023 and June 2024. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed following Braun and Clarke's reflective thematic analysis approach. Fourteen couples were enrolled using purposive sampling with variation in sociodemographic information. The participants' normal lives were disrupted, and couples adopted both individual and joint coping strategies to regain a new sense of balance. The overarching theme \"Refine and Regain\" was proposed during this process. This emerged from five main themes: \"Unrecognized distress and emotional fluctuation,\" \"Lost in frustration,\" \"Interrupted family and social connections,\" \"Striving for survival,\" and \"Growth and adaption.\" Couples got through physical and emotional difficulties during the anti-cancer treatment, starting from accepting the fact they got the cancer. Some participants showed a progressive adaptation to cancer over time, while others experienced a dynamic, non-linear adjustment process. The findings revealed variations in couples' psychosocial adaptation to prostate cancer, highlighting the need for tailored interventions to enhance mutual coping.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Skeletal muscle-derived extracellular vesicles (SkM-EVs) are promising candidates for non-invasive, systemically delivered therapies, but their functional specificity relative to clinically advanced mesenchymal stem cell-derived EVs (MSC-EVs) remains unclear. We reanalyzed public miRNA-seq datasets of SkM-EVs and MSC-EVs and integrated validated miRNA–mRNA interactions to infer pathway-level repression potential of EV miRNA cargo. Two complementary approaches were used: a differential-expression-based relative evaluation with RBiomirGS, and an abundance-weighted absolute evaluation that converts miRNA profiles into gene-level Impact Scores followed by preranked KEGG enrichment. Despite their different formulations, both approaches converged on a shared pattern. SkM-EV miRNAs showed a predicted repression bias in FoxO, TGF-β and ErbB signaling pathways linked to muscle atrophy, metabolic homeostasis and pro-proliferative signaling. By contrast, MSC-EV miRNAs showed a predicted repression bias in immune signaling pathways. These source-dependent pathway signatures provide hypothesis-generating evidence that SkM-EVs may be better suited for muscle-, metabolic-, and cancer-related indications, whereas MSC-EVs may be more appropriate for immunomodulatory indications, pending experimental validation. Our miRNA–target-based framework provides a general strategy to benchmark EV sources at the pathway level directly from miRNA profiles.",

    "Abstract": "Run-up velocity and take-off step technique influence long jump performance. We determined run-up velocity and jump distance of two athletes with transtibial amputation (TTA) who used a manufacturer-recommended stiffness running-specific prosthesis (RSP; 39.5 kN/m), and a less (36.0 kN/m) and more stiff RSP (43.9 kN/m) and eight non-amputee athletes who used a regulation run-up surface with a regulation (1630 kN/m), and two compliant (84.0 and 90.0 kN/m) take-off platforms. Athletes with TTA had no significant difference in maximum run-up velocity or jump distance between RSP stiffnesses, but jump distance was positively associated with run-up velocity (p = 0.002). Non-amputee athletes had no significant difference in maximum run-up velocity between take-off platforms but jump distance increased as platform stiffness decreased (p = 6.07 × 10<sup>-5</sup>) and as maximum run-up velocity increased (p = 0.001). Non-amputee athletes jumped 7% farther when they used the most compliant compared to regulation take-off platform and had the same run up velocity (p = 0.82) but jumped 16% further (p = 0.01) than athletes with TTA using the recommended stiffness RSP despite the RSP storing 45% more elastic energy than the most compliant take-off platform (p = 6.73 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). These results suggest take-off platform stiffness affects long jump performance in non-amputees.",

    "Abstract": "Achieving uniform, high-quality, and thickness-controlled two-dimensional semiconductor films at the wafer scale remains a critical challenge for practical device integration. This work presents a scalable synthesis method for MoS<sub>2</sub> films on Si/SiO<sub>2</sub> wafers using a three-step conversion (3SC) process. The process comprises the deposition of an amorphous MoO<sub>x</sub> film, low-temperature high-pressure H₂S annealing for sulfurization, and high-temperature Ar annealing to enhance crystallinity. Precise thickness control, from monolayer to ~ 20 nm, is realized by adjusting the initial MoO<sub>x</sub> thickness. A higher oxygen content in MoO<sub>x</sub> improves sulfurization efficiency and promotes uniform conversion to MoS<sub>2</sub>. Structural and optical characterizations using Raman and Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy confirm enhanced crystallinity, with a PL-FWHM narrowed to ~ 0.08 eV. The 3SC method achieves uniform MoS<sub>2</sub> coverage across the entire wafer, demonstrating its compatibility with large-area fabrication and its potential for future electronics and optoelectronics applications.",

    "Abstract": "End-to-end or Deep Reinforcement Learning-based control of autonomous vehicles generally leverages a sequence of decoupled perception-action protocols. One main limitation of such frameworks is the required backpropagation algorithm to optimize the underlying mapping function or policy network. This is because although the learning goal usually involves several objectives, they must be aggregated to realize a single objective loss utilized by the backpropagation algorithm. This also limits the preference-based driving behavior from a user perspective. To overcome these challenges, we present NeuroAction-a multi-objective neuroevolutionary method designed for reinforcement learning-based autonomous driving where several goals or objectives can be optimized simultaneously. Specifically, we propose a formulation of reinforcement learning-based control of autonomous vehicles as a multiobjective optimization problem. Consequently, any multiobjective evolutionary algorithm can be used to solve the resulting problem with the aim of generating a Pareto-front of optimal policy networks. In other words, the resulting framework is capable of generating policies that are suitable for providing users with different trade-offs based on their desired driving preferences. We investigated the proposed framework on a benchmark DRL-based autonomous driving task and presented performance evolution based on three different EMO algorithms.",

    "Abstract": "For the safety monitoring of herbal medicines (HMs), HM inspectors carry out an organoleptic examination before acceptance for market supply. The organoleptic test processes are often regarded as labor-intensive, thus calling for efficient and reliable aids. Here, we propose a plasmonic artificial HM inspector based on a collaboration between surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and deep learning (DL). Inherently, a SERS spectrum of an HM specimen contains several peaks that match bioactive compounds in the sample, yielding so-called fingerprint information of HM. Besides, its rapid, few-second data-acquisition speed lends the SERS-DL analysis adaptability to a complementary inspection method for organoleptic examination. Regarding the accuracy and reliability of this new method, the synergistic integration of SERS with DL attains ~95% accuracy in labor-saving differentiation of 35 HM species with similar appearances or of the same genus. Our SERS-DL-based analysis can potentially aid the organoleptic HM inspection and help upgrade the HM database, along with images and other analytical chemistry data.",

    "Abstract": "Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is essential for managing and searching massive image repositories across a wide variety of applications. Nevertheless, some traditional CBIR systems exhibit low retrieval accuracy because they use predetermined feature weights, lack semantic gaps, and poorly exploit heterogeneous visual features. To overcome such difficulties, the present study will introduce a multi-feature adaptive CBIR framework that combines deep and handcrafted features using an information entropy-based fusion and a trust-based weighting system. Deep convolutional models, combined with complementary low-level descriptors, are used to extract discriminative features in the proposed approach. A PageRank-based similarity propagation strategy is also used to narrow image ranking by leveraging similarity relationships across the globe. Evaluation is performed using standard retrieval measures, such as Mean Average Precision (mAP), Precision at K, Recall at K, and NDCG. The experimental results show that the proposed approach consistently improves performance across benchmark datasets. The framework boosts mAP by up to 8.6% over traditional fixed-weight fusion methods, while Precision@10 and NDCG@10 increase by 6.2% and 7.4%, respectively. The statistical analysis shows that these improvements are significant at the 95% confidence level, indicating that retrieval behavior is robust and reliable. These findings confirm the efficiency of entropy-driven adaptive fusion and ranking refinement in overcoming the major drawbacks of current CBIR systems, and the suggested framework is appropriate for large-scale image search in practice.",

    "Abstract": "End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with an increased risk. This study investigates associations between cognitive decline, resting-state networks (RSNs), and biochemical indicators in ESRD patients pre-/post-hemodialysis. 20 hemodialysis (HD) patients and 22 healthy controls underwent resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and neuropsychological assessments. Resting-state networks (RSNs) were extracted via independent component analysis (ICA), with functional connectivity strength compared between pre-/post-HD patients and controls. Correlations between connectivity strength and biochemical indicators were analyzed. Compared to HCs, the post-HD group exhibited significantly decreased FC between the auditory-somatomotor network (t = - 5.120, P < 0.001) and the visual-somatomotor network (t = - 4.199, P < 0.001). In contrast, FC between the default mode and dorsal attention networks was significantly increased (t = 2.908, P = 0.006). While serum electrolytes and iron metabolism markers remained stable post-HD (all P > 0.05), phosphorus levels decreased (P = 0.046), with significant improvements in renal function: eGFR increased from 4.560 ± 1.650 to 16.980 ± 6.428 mL/min, urea, creatinine, and PTH levels decreased (all P < 0.001). Elevated baseline chloride levels were associated with reduced post-HD attention network connectivity (r = -0.758, P < 0.001), while cognitive improvement correlated inversely with baseline connectivity (r = -0.619, P = 0.004) and positively with connectivity plasticity (r = 0.513, P = 0.021).

    "Abstract": "The implementation of Decision Support System and data visualization technologies, as Augmented Reality (AR), offers potential advantages in herd management by enabling real-time access to critical animal data, enhancing decision-making, and providing training opportunities for farmers. However, investigating the possible spread of technologies in livestock farming is fundamental to understand which factors could influence the adoption of specific technologies by farmers. For this reason, this study aimed to investigate factors influencing farmers' attitudes towards the use of AR technologies, such as Smart Glasses for AR, in livestock farms. The research involved 18 dairy farms with different technological adoption level where the main discrimination technology was the Automatic Milking System (AMS). The study revealed that farms that use AMS generally had greater technological implementation and were more familiar with advanced livestock technologies. While both AMS farmers and Conventional Milking Parlor (CMP) farmers had positive attitudes toward AR use, CMP farmers perceived greater potential benefits because of their limited access to on-site animal data. The study concludes that augmented reality has the potential to enhance the efficiency of livestock farming data use, especially on CMP farms, by offering an innovative method to visualize animal data. While the results align with existing literature, future studies should consider geographical constraints, sample size, and temporal and cultural variations. Finally, it is also recommended to explore the interoperability of AR with existing precision livestock farming technologies and to address the main barriers to its adoption, such as cost and training.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Fractured reservoirs, comprising over 20% of the world’s oil reserves, present significant challenges to enhanced oil recovery (EOR). This study investigates the potential of the halophilic bacterium Haloferax mediterranei in microbial EOR (MEOR) for improving oil recovery in fractured porous media. Experiments using a heterogeneous glass micromodel were conducted at biomass concentrations of 5.07, 6.74, and 10.14 g/L. Results showed that the optimal biomass concentration (5.07 g/L) increased oil recovery by 23% through selective plugging. Higher biomass concentrations caused excessive polymer production, blocking communication pathways between the matrix and fractures, reducing oil recovery to 11.7% and 7.8%. Permeability reductions were evaluated in two core samples, achieving average reductions of 53.5%, 62.5%, and 73.5% for the respective biomass concentrations. Using the optimal biomass concentration (5.07 g/L), oil recovery in two similar core samples increased by 14% and 12.6%. These findings underscore the importance of optimizing biomass concentration to balance permeability reduction and oil recovery efficiency. The study highlights MEOR’s potential as a cost-effective, sustainable strategy for enhancing oil recovery in fractured reservoirs. It also provides valuable insights for improving future EOR operations, contributing to global energy resource sustainability.",

    "Abstract": "This pragmatic randomized controlled trial aimed to assess the effect of a passive display of artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive analytics on hours free of clinical deterioration events among medical and surgical patients in an acute care cardiology medical-surgical ward. 10,422 inpatient visits were randomly assigned by cluster to the intervention group of a display of risk trajectories or to a control group of usual medical care. The trial was undertaken on an 85-bed inpatient cardiology and cardiac surgery ward of an academic hospital with a substantial implementation and education plan. This was a passive display with no specific response mandated. The primary analysis compared events of clinical deterioration (death, emergent ICU transfer, emergent endotracheal intubation, cardiac arrest, or emergent surgery) and compared mortality 21 days after admission. Patients with a large spike in risk score had, on average, twice the length of hospital stay (6.8 compared to 3.4 days). There was no change in the primary outcome between groups. Among those who had a clinical event, there were more event-free hours in the intervention/display-on group compared to the standard-of-care/display-off, but this did not reach statistical significance. Clinicians chose to transfer 11% of patients into or out of display beds, a censoring event removing them from the analysis, thereby undermining aspects of the randomized nature of the study. Predictive analytics monitoring incorporating continuous cardiorespiratory monitoring and displays of risk trajectories coupled with an education plan did not improve patient outcomes. While necessary to conduct the study, the pragmatic design allowed for significant movement towards intervention/displayed beds for sicker patients. Design considerations in the future must focus on understanding clinicians' interpretation, care processes, and communication practices.Clinical trial registration number: NCT04359641 Registered 4/24/20.",

    "Abstract": "In pursuit of sustainability, it is necessary to comprehend the evolving relationship between economic growth and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study conducts Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) for comparative sectoral analysis of the world's ten largest GHG emitting countries across their eight sectors; agriculture, building, fuel exploitation, industrial combustion, power industry, processes, transport and waste, using latest available data from 2000 to 2023. This study disaggregates sectoral emissions to evaluate the extent to which economic growth has been decoupled from GHG emissions, thereby offering insight into national sectoral emission trajectories and sustainability progress. This study offers sectoral ranking of countries based on average GHG emission abatement during 2000-2023 and offers the sectoral GHG emission intensity in these countries relative in year 2000. The agriculture and building sectors demonstrated significant decoupling, abatement of GHG emissions by an average of 6.44 MtCO<sub>2</sub> and 6.34 MtCO<sub>2</sub>, respectively, through sustainable practices. The fuel exploitation sector achieved modest abatement of 2.24 MtCO<sub>2</sub>, though emissions intensified in China and Indonesia. In the industrial combustion sector, GHG emissions abatement were recorded by 0.74 MtCO<sub>2</sub> but intensified in several emerging economies. The transport sector recorded a slight intensity of 0.36 MtCO<sub>2</sub>, highlighting the urgent need for low carbon mobility solutions. The waste sector achieved the most substantial GHG emissions abatement of 16.31 MtCO<sub>2</sub>, led by USA, despite intensified in four other nations. The findings emphasized the critical need for tailored, sector specific policy interventions, technology adoption, and behavioral changes to achieve sustained decarbonization. The study contributes to the global discourse on climate mitigation by offering comparative sectors specific insights to align national energy structures with global decarbonizing practices.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have led to a surge in AI/ML-enabled medical devices, posing new challenges for regulators because best practices for developing, testing, and monitoring these devices are still emerging. Consequently, there is a critical need for up-to-date data analyses of the regulatory landscape to inform policy-making. However, such analyses have historically relied upon manual annotation efforts because regulatory documents are unstructured, complex, multi-modal, and filled with jargon. Efforts to automate annotation using simple natural language processing methods have achieved limited success, as they lack the reasoning needed to interpret regulatory materials. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) presents an unprecedented opportunity to unlock information embedded in regulatory documents. This work conducts the first wide-ranging validation study of LLMs for scaling data analyses in the field of medical device regulatory science. Evaluating LLM outputs using expert manual annotations and “LLM-as-a-judge,” we find that LLMs can accurately extract attributes spanning pre- and post-market settings, with accuracy rates often reaching 80% or higher. We then demonstrate how LLMs can scale up analyses in three applications: (1) monitoring device validation practices, (2) coding medical device reports, and (3) identifying potential risk factors for post-market adverse events.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Stimuli-responsive supramolecular systems enable spatiotemporal control of nucleic acid (NA) delivery. To achieve precise and programmable vectors, we designed azobenzene-bridged ionizable amphiphilic Janus glycosides (IAJGs) as single-component, light-responsive DNA carriers. These glucopyranose-based dimers undergo reversible E/Z photoisomerization while forming stable nanocomplexes with plasmid DNA (pDNA). Photoisomerization alters nanocomplex size, surface charge, and internal order, resulting in distinct transfection outcomes. In vitro, O - and S -glycoside derivatives displayed isomer-dependent activity across COS-7, HepG2, and RAW264.7 cells, with pronounced switching effects specially in macrophages. In vivo, systemic administration revealed organ-selective responses: O -glycosides shifted expression from liver to lung upon E → Z conversion, whereas S -glycosides favored spleen targeting. All formulations maintained high cell viability. These results highlight photoswitchable IAJGs as structurally defined vectors for adjustable control over NA delivery and organ tropism.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Speckle-pattern interrogation offers a route to high-resolution spectral sensing, but its uptake has been constrained by poor temporal stability under real-world conditions. Here, we introduce an ultra-stable speckle-based architecture that overcomes these limitations and enables real-time structural health monitoring of uncrewed aerial vehicles. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on large-scale, free-space passive speckle decorrelation, our system utilizes an ultra-compact speckle pattern via laser-written scattering centers in a high aspect ratio flat fiber, encapsulated within a 3D-printed polylactide housing. This architecture suppresses environmental drift and enables robust, high-fidelity interrogation of fiber Bragg gratings in dynamic aerospace conditions. The system demonstrated exceptional stability under sustained mechanical excitation, maintaining measurement integrity at ±7 G sinusoidal acceleration along the axial direction. Furthermore, in-flight validation across uncrewed aerial vehicle flight tests confirmed real-time strain interrogation in the −100–400 µε range with a standard deviation in measurement of 1.63 µε. These results mark the demonstration of stable, real-time speckle-based interrogation in flight, establishing a path toward broader deployment of specklemeters in harsh environments.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Acute rejection (AR) remains a critical challenge to graft survival in kidney transplantation. Although dextrorotatory-amino acids (D-AAs) have been recognized as biologically active compounds, their role in mediating immunosuppression was poorly depicted. To address this, serum samples from renal transplant recipients were analyzed via [d0]/[d5]-estradiol-3-benzoate-17β-chloroformate (17β-EBC) based ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS) to assess D-AAs levels. scRNA-seq data from the GSE109564 dataset were analyzed. Additionally, murine skin and kidney transplantation models were utilized to assess the in vivo impact of d-kynurenine (D-Kyn) treatment on AR. Through analysis of patient serum and murine transplantation models, we identified D-Kyn as a key metabolite whose elevated levels correlate with stable graft function. We found that D-Kyn, more effectively than its chiral counterpart L-Kyn, inhibits the inflammatory activity of M1 macrophages. This suppression is mediated via the PHGDH/TLR4/Caspase-1 pathway, reducing the transcription and secretion of inflammatory cytokines. In murine models of skin and kidney transplantation, D-Kyn treatment demonstrated potent immunosuppressive effects, attenuating macrophage-mediated inflammation and CD8 + T cell activation, potentially through regulation of macrophage-derived IL-23a. Our findings reveal D-Kyn as a promising therapeutic candidate for preventing acute rejection and improving transplant outcomes and lay the foundation for future clinical applications from the perspective of dextrorotatory amino acids.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is an otologic emergency with often unclear etiology. Vestibular migraine (VM) is a neurological disorder that may coexist with auditory symptoms and potentially affect hearing outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of VM in patients with idiopathic SSNHL and assess its impact on hearing recovery after treatment. Method: Forty-three patients aged 20–71 years with idiopathic SSNHL were included. All underwent audiological evaluation and were assessed for VM using the Bárány Society criteria. Hearing recovery was evaluated based on Siegel criteria. Clinical features and hearing outcomes were compared between the VM and non-VM groups. Results: VM was diagnosed in 10 (23.3%) patients and migraine in 14 (32.6%). The mean age was 52.5 ± 14.0 years in the VM group and 44.7 ± 14.6 in the non-VM group. No significant differences were found between groups in age, gender, comorbidities, or baseline/posttreatment hearing thresholds ( p &gt; .05). Treatment response was also similar ( p = .197). Conclusions: VM is relatively frequent in patients with idiopathic SSNHL, but does not significantly influence hearing severity or recovery. Further studies with larger samples are needed to clarify the relationship between VM and SSNHL.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Integrating healthcare systems with intelligent transportation networks represents a critical frontier in modern urban infrastructure, where efficient resource allocation and timely service delivery can significantly impact patient outcomes. However, current approaches often fail to capture the complex interplay between healthcare facility accessibility and transportation dynamics, particularly during emergencies. Additionally, the temporal dependencies in healthcare service delivery follow strict sequential patterns that significantly influence both routine operations and emergency response effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a multi‐scale spatio‐temporal transformer network for healthcare and transportation (MST‐HT) that leverages generative AI capabilities. Our model employs multiple specialised transformer networks to model different spatial scales, capturing hidden dependencies while using graph convolutional networks to learn static infrastructure features. The architecture incorporates healthcare district patterns, emergency response corridors and facility distributions through a novel gating mechanism that adaptively combines features based on their predictive importance. The model maintains awareness of critical service delivery patterns by embedding healthcare‐specific temporal position information while optimising resource allocation. Experiments on real‐world datasets demonstrate MST‐HT's superior performance, achieving a 15.7% reduction in emergency response times and a 23.4% improvement in resource allocation efficiency compared to state‐of‐the‐art baselines.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Nepal's electricity sector operates under a monopsony, with government entities dominating generation, transmission, and distribution. This market structure suppresses competition, leading to inherent challenges in establishing fair and efficient electricity tariff systems. This study aims to address these inefficiencies by diagnosing the existing tariff structure and proposing restructured time‐of‐use (TOU) models. A key constraint of the proposal is ensuring revenue neutrality for the utility. The research employs a dual‐method approach. First, it models locational marginal pricing (LMP) across six load buses in power world simulator, integrating a 144 MW generator and categorizing demand into residential, industrial, commercial, non‐commercial, and other loads. Second, it analyzes daily load profiles from Ghusel village to design optimal TOU tariff models for residential consumers. The LMP modeling revealed significant locational price variations, highlighting congestion and inefficiencies in the current system. Furthermore, introducing distributed generation reduced the LMP for residential consumers by 12.15% compared to base case scenarios. The analysis of load profiles led to the selection of a four‐period TOU structure (morning peak, evening peak, normal, and off‐peak) as the most effective. Specific tariffs—a demand charge of 60 Nepalese Rupee (NPR)/kW and energy rates of NPR 9.49, 12.55, 6.78, and 4.07, respectively—were found to improve peak load shifting, revenue collection, and consumer fairness. The study demonstrates the strong potential of LMP and structured TOU tariffs to enhance grid reliability, sustainability, and fairness in Nepal. However, successful implementation requires overcoming practical obstacles such as cross‐subsidies, regulatory inflexibility, and inadequate metering. Therefore, this study recommends a gradual policy strategy involving pilot initiatives, regulatory reforms, and consumer awareness campaigns.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Vitiligo is a cutaneous autoimmune disease characterized by the destruction of epidermal melanocytes leading to white patches with a global prevalence of about 0.5–2%, and patients’ quality of life are greatly affected by the change in appearance and social discrimination caused by the disease. Most of the key cytokines in the pathogenesis of vitiligo act through the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway, which is an effective therapeutic target. The first generation Janus kinase inhibitors, i.e., tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, inhibit a variety of Janus kinases, whereas the new generation Janus kinase inhibitors, such as ritlecitinib and upadacitinib, exhibit inhibitory effects only on specific Janus kinases; they are therefore selective as well as safer and more effective. In this review, we aim to provide an up-to-date view of vitiligo pathogenesis at the cellular, molecular, and genetic levels and further to elucidate the relationship between Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway components and vitiligo. Finally, we summarize currently market-approved and preclinical Janus kinase inhibitors, highlighting the latest advances in their clinical applications.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis are increasingly concerning health issues, especially in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, where metabolic problems drive liver disease progression. While lifestyle changes remain essential, new drug strategies—particularly sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists—have gained growing interest for their potential to protect the liver. This review examines how sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists might help treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, focusing on their mechanisms of action, study evidence, and results from meta-analyses. A thorough search of the literature found studies on how these drugs affect insulin sensitivity, liver fat, and inflammation. Preclinical models show that they can lower liver fat, reduce oxidative stress, and decrease fibrosis markers. Clinical trials and meta-analyses support their potential to improve liver enzyme levels, decrease liver fat, and slow fibrosis growth. Overall, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists appear promising in the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, especially in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Still, more long-term research studies are needed to confirm how well they work, how safe they are, and the best way to use them, either alone or in combination with other treatments. These drugs may represent important advances in the treatment of liver diseases linked to metabolic problems.",

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of EPI (July 1, 2022, and April 12, 2024) patients discharged on full oral feedings. The primary outcome was postmenstrual age (PMA) when full oral feeding was achieved. Secondary outcomes included time to full oral feeds, PMA and weight at initiation and discharge, growth velocity, and length of hospital stay. Baseline characteristics were similar among 119 EPIs (CB-OFP: n = 61; VB-OFP: n = 58) except for maternal magnesium sulfate exposure and postnatal steroid use. CB-OFP infants achieved full oral feeding at an earlier PMA (median: 37.6 vs. 40.1 weeks; p &lt; 0.001) and in fewer median days (20 vs. 27 days; p = 0.03). CB-OFP was also associated with earlier discharge (median PMA at discharge: 38.6 vs. 41.3 weeks; p &lt; 0.001) and shorter length of stay (93 vs. 111.5 days; p &lt; 0.001). Growth velocity and discharge weight z-scores did not differ significantly between groups. Our experience suggests that a CB-OFP strategy may be associated with earlier attainment of full oral feeds and a shorter length of stay compared with VB-OFP. Future randomized controlled trials are warranted to validate these findings and to assess potential long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes with different feeding strategies.",

    "Abstract": "This case series describes high-resolution ultrasound-based diagnosis of meralgia paresthetica and the technical details of ultrasound-guided perineural therapeutic steroid injections. Twelve patients with clinically suspected meralgia paresthetica were prospectively assessed. The cross-sectional area of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve was measured proximal and distal to the inguinal ligament using an 18-MHz transducer. Of the 12 patients, 10 demonstrated sonographic abnormalities, with a cross-sectional area difference greater than 2 mm2 serving as a diagnostic criterion. Eight patients with confirmed diagnosis and nonsurgical causes of entrapment underwent ultrasound-guided perineural triamcinolone acetate injections, resulting in complete symptom relief in 87% of cases at 6 weeks. Literature review findings showed comparable success rates of 80 to 85% for ultrasound-guided injections and 80% for surgical decompression. No significant complications were encountered, highlighting the safety and efficacy of this minimally invasive approach. High-resolution ultrasound thus serves as a valuable tool for both diagnosis and guided treatment of meralgia paresthetica, offering cost-effective and patient-friendly management with outcomes comparable to surgery.",

    "Abstract": "Enteroviral infections range from self-limiting illnesses to severe neurological disorders. A thorough review of published literature reveals few studies highlighting the neuroimaging findings of such cases; however, none have been published from the Indian subcontinent. The present study analyzes the varied imaging and clinical spectrum of microbiologically proven cases of encephalomyelitis due to enterovirus in a tertiary care institute in northern India. This prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care institute in north India, and included 23 cases that presented with variable neurological symptoms of central nervous system infection and were found to have enterovirus, confirmed using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. All these patients had undergone a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI spine was done depending on the symptoms of the patients. Imaging analysis was done by two experienced neuroradiologists. Fever was the most common presenting symptom, followed by altered sensorium and seizures. In neuroimaging, we found ganglio-capsular (13 cases, 56%), brain stem (7, 30%), cerebral hemisphere (6, 26%), and spinal cord (3, 13.04%) involvement. Basal ganglia and brainstem involvement was a common pattern seen in our cases, unlike the previously reported pattern of predominant posterior fossa structure involvement. As the pattern and site of both the spinal cord and the brain differ from previously published literature, further analysis would be needed to confirm the cause of such findings.",

This report presents a case of GGI without a pathological lead point, possibly only the second such case in literature where a lead point was not present. A 57-year-old male underwent a successful ileostomy reversal following a low anterior resection for rectal carcinoma. Postoperatively, the patient experienced an acute onset of retching, vomiting, and inability to tolerate oral intake on the fourth postoperative day. Nasogastric tube placement was attempted, which was met with resistance, preventing its successful placement into the stomach. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan of the abdomen was subsequently performed, revealing the presence of GGI. An attempt at endoscopic reduction was made but proved unsuccessful.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Urban mobility decisions have become increasingly complex as transportation options expand beyond traditional modes to include ride-hailing services and on-demand shuttles. This paper investigates how consumers make these mobility choices and examines the intention-behavior relationship in real-world contexts. Three studies identified key decision-making factors and connected them to established mobility research. The main study developed a mobile application offering an access-based shuttle service, capturing 39,000 orders from 950 users over six months in Shanghai. By analyzing both stated intentions and actual behavior, the study examined travel mode choices in everyday mobility contexts. Findings reveal that consumer decisions rely primarily on three core dimensions—punctuality, predictability, and convenience—rather than the diverse factors emphasized in previous research. Intentions closely mirror actual behavior in routine mobility services. Consumers simplify decision-making by focusing on fundamental service characteristics, with additional bundled features playing minimal roles in their choices.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Drawing on a qualitative study of the French textile industry, this paper examines how Circular Economy (CE) policies impact on business model innovation and the geography, organization, and environmental upgrading of global value chains (GVCs). Our findings show that while policies which promote practices such as eco-design, reuse, and recycling have stimulated change, their impact varies significantly by firm type. Multinational lead firms have mostly reacted to policy incentives by integrating minor circular adaptations into pre-existing linear, volume-driven business models, resulting in little change to the organization or geography of their GVCs. Born-circular firms, by contrast, have developed innovative value propositions that embed circularity at their core, seeking to reorganize GVCs both geographically and organizationally, notably by integrating novel actors and creating inter-sectoral linkages. However, these firms faced significant commercial and technical constraints and remained limited in scale and influence. Overall, although these adaptations have led to the integration of new intermediary actors across the value chains studied, they have generally failed to trigger systemic change or geographic shifts. While broader EU-level policies have the potential to drive more far-reaching GVC restructuring and environmental upgrading, the challenges identified here will persist, hampering progress and making sustainability outcomes uncertain.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid advancement of communication technologies and the miniaturization of electronic devices have the demand for high-performance, lightweight microwave-absorbing materials. However, constructing efficient microwave absorbers using two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic materials remains a significant challenge. In this work, 2D van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe5GeTe2 (FGT) crystals were synthesized via chemical vapor transport, and FGT nanosheets were subsequently obtained through liquid-phase exfoliation. Subsequently, this study integrated FGT nanosheets with aramid nanofibers (ANFs) to construct ultralight aerogels via a synergistic vacuum-assisted filtration and freeze-drying techniques. The resulting FGT/ANF (AFGT) aerogels exhibit tunable densities (12.4–38.7 mg/cm3) and exceptional microwave absorption properties. The optimized AFGT-3 aerogel demonstrated superior microwave absorption performance, achieving a minimum reflection loss of −48.4 dB at 9.8 GHz with a thickness of 1.9 mm, alongside an effective absorption bandwidth of 3.4 GHz (9.2–12.6 GHz). This work not only pioneers the application of 2D van der Waals ferromagnets in functional aerogels but also provides a viable strategy for developing next-generation ultralight electromagnetic protection materials.",

    "Abstract": "Realizing the promise of artificial intelligence (AI) to accelerate scientific progress and deliver technological impact depends on how effectively AI can be integrated into real-world decision-making processes. As Peter Norvig states, “Somewhat remarkably, almost all AI research until very recently has assumed that the performance measure can be exactly and correctly specified in the form of a utility or reward function” [S. J. Russell and P. Norvig, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Pearson, 2020)]. Once the reward function is known, any problem can be formulated as an optimization or search problem—the areas well explored within the AI community. However, while the long-term objectives of a specific activity are often well defined, constructing short-term rewards that remain aligned with those goals and consistent with real-world constraints remains a major unresolved challenge. Such alignment has been achieved in domains such as chess, Go, and supervised machine learning problems, where objectives are well defined and easily simulated. However, no universal solution exists for defining intermediate rewards for complex, evolving scientific goals, which remains an open challenge. Correspondingly, the key to operationalizing automated instruments, integrating multi-instrument self-driving laboratories, and building geographically distributed research facilities is to generate experiment-aligned, probabilistic, domain-specific reward functions. These rewards must be consistent with long-term experimental objectives while remaining actionable on the timescales of decision-making on laboratory tools in microscopy and materials synthesis labs—proper reward definition operationalizes scientific intent. Here, we review the extant reward structures in the physical sciences and summarize opportunities for reward design informed by physical principles, human heuristics, and LLM-based reasoning.",

However, gaps remain between abstract quantum algorithmic development and practical applications in computational sciences. In this perspective article, we propose several properties that scalable quantum computational science methods should possess. We further discuss how block-encodings and polynomial transformations can potentially serve as a unified framework with the desired properties. Recent advancements on these topics are presented, including the construction and assembly of block-encodings, and various generalizations of quantum signal processing (QSP) algorithms to perform polynomial transformations. The scalability of QSP methods on parallel and distributed quantum architectures is also highlighted. Promising applications in simulation and observable estimation in chemistry, physics, and optimization problems are presented. We hope this perspective serves as a gentle introduction to state-of-the-art quantum algorithms for the computational science community and inspires future development of scalable quantum computational science methodologies that bridge theory and practice.",

    "Abstract": "Symmetry-protected bound states in the continuum (SP-BICs) offer a promising approach for high-quality (Q) metasurface design due to their non-radiative properties. However, conventional isolated SP-BICs typically offer limited enhancement to Q and require extremely small symmetry-breaking perturbations to become excitable, presenting challenges in fabrication and practical deployment. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance the Q-factor of resonances by merging BICs, enabling the structure to sustain ultra-high Q-factor even under relatively large symmetry-breaking conditions. Specifically, a double-layer metasurface composed of two silicon nanopore arrays is designed. By tuning the interlayer distance, SP-BICs are effectively merged with Fabry––Pérot-type BICs in parameter space, modifying the radiation behavior of the original SP-BICs. Results show that the merged BIC structure enhances the Q-factor by three orders of magnitude compared to isolated BICs. In sensing performance, the proposed structure achieves a refractive index sensitivity of 126 nm/RIU and an outstanding figure of merit surpassing 1.4 × 105 RIU−1, which substantially outperforms isolated BICs. Moreover, diverse high-Q modal features are observed in the wavelength-offset parameter space, offering new opportunities for multi-channel sensing and narrowband filtering applications.",

    "Abstract": "It is important to predict the theoretical upper limit of lattice thermal conductivity and carrier mobility in the face of high uncertainty in experimental measurements of boron phosphide (BP) and boron arsenides (BAs). Using the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) approach, we quantify the contributions of three-phonon and four-phonon scattering to thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of BP is determined by three-phonon scattering and is independent of four-phonon scattering. Due to the large bandgap between acoustic and optical phonons in BAs, three-phonon scattering is prevented, while four-phonon scattering is permitted. At room temperature, the predicted thermal conductivity with three- and four-phonon scattering is 505 W/m K (BP) and 1506 W/m K (BAs). After considering isotope scattering, the thermal conductivity is reduced to 468 and 1124 W/m K, respectively. Neuroevolution potential is trained using machine learning methods. Subsequently, the extrapolated lattice thermal conductivity through nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulation is 304 W/m K (BP) and 1008 W/m K (BAs), respectively. The Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are employed to correct bandgap and band edge shape. Utilizing the Wannier function interpolation methodology, the ambipolar mobility predicted by the iterative BTE is μa=1.61×103cm2/Vs (BP) and μa=1.79×103cm2/Vs (BAs) at room temperature, which is in good agreement with the experimental measurements. By analyzing the characteristics of branch-dependent phonon scattering, the dominant scattering of charge carriers is attributed to longitudinal acoustic phonons.",

    "Abstract": "We develop a semi-analytic theory for describing nonadiabatic bound–bound, free–bound, bound–free, and free–free photoprocesses in heteronuclear ions in the regime of the superlinear potential energy curve crossing. It extends the previous semiclassical method for calculating the absorption and emission spectra of strongly and moderately bound diatomic species based on the linear curve crossing model and can be used for molecules and ions with small dissociation energies, D0 ≲ kBT. The use of quasicontinuum approximation for rovibrational levels allows us to give a unified description of the integral contributions of the discrete and continuous spectra of the molecular species with linear and superlinear crossings to the effective cross sections and rate coefficients of the radiative processes in the systems studied. Specific calculations were performed for the excimer-like NeXe+ ion (DeNeXe+=37.3 meV). Potential energy curves and dipole transition matrix elements are evaluated using ab initio multi-reference calculations with a perturbative description of relativistic effects. In contrast to ArXe+ and KrXe+ ions studied previously, the main contributions to the absorption spectra of NeXe+ are due to bound–bound transitions and photoassociation. The emission spectra at room temperatures are determined predominantly by the bound–bound transitions, while at temperatures above 450 K, the most significant contribution to the radiation is made by bound–free phototransitions. Our calculations are in good agreement with the available experimental data. The results obtained are of interest for chemical physics, spectroscopy of weakly bound molecular systems, and physics of radiative processes in gases and plasmas, as well as for the kinetics of active media of excilamps and gas lasers based on noble gas mixtures.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Traditionally, there has been little emphasis regarding the self-evaluated experience following gender affirmation surgery (GAS). As such, this study aimed to evaluate patient-reported outcomes following vaginoplasty in transgender individuals using a novel and validated Affirming Surgery Form and Function Individual Reporting Measure (AFFIRM-A). Methods: 279 transgender patients completed the AFFIRM-A survey, reporting on their experiences with feminizing GAS outcomes. Surveys were given to patients via email prior to GAS, at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively. Pre and post GAS responses were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank tests. All participants voluntarily completed the same survey using the Vision Tree Platform to eliminate bias. Results: Prior to GAS, ~3% of respondents reported positive feelings about their genitals, ~18% reported comfort with a sexual partner seeing their genitals, ~1% reported the absence of embarrassment regarding their genitals, and ~1% reported that their genitals matched their gender identity. Six months after surgery, the percentages rose to ~85% (p&amp;lt;0.001), ~77% (p&amp;lt;0.001), 66% (p&amp;lt;0.001), and ~85% (p&amp;lt;0.001) respectively. Prior to GAS, ~78% of respondents reported they could not dress as desired because of the appearance of their genitals and 83% reported the appearance of their genitals prevented them from doing some enjoyable activities. Six months after surgery, the percentages fell to ~3% (p&amp;lt;0.001), and ~7% respectively (p&amp;lt;0.001). Conclusion: Gender affirming surgeries like vaginoplasty are associated with dramatic quality of life improvement in transgender people. All six gender identity metrics measured by the validated AFFIRM-A survey showed unequivocal benefits following vaginoplasty.",

Here, we demonstrate that in HCC, mitochondria can be transferred from hepatic stellate cells to cancer cells via tunneling nanotubes (TNTs), supplying essential energy for tumor growth. Simultaneously, cancer cells offload damaged mitochondria to macrophages through extracellular vesicles (EVs), facilitating their clearance and promoting tumor development. To disrupt this mitochondrial exchange, we developed a responsive liposomal nanocarrier (L&amp;G@Lipo PPV ) coencapsulating L-778123 and GW4869 to simultaneously inhibit TNT-mediated and vesicle-mediated mitochondrial transfer. This work provides the first comprehensive evidence of mitochondrial transfer dynamics in the TME, with tumor cells as the central hub, and highlights L&amp;G@Lipo PPV as an innovative and effective strategy to block mitochondrial crosstalk. Our findings address critical challenges of drug solubility and delivery, offering a rational approach to reprogram the TME and suppress liver cancer progression.",

    "Abstract": "The heart can adapt its performance in response to changing metabolic demands of the rest of the body. A central mechanism intrinsic to the heart is to modulate the function of the cardiac contractile proteins via posttranslational modifications. Although phosphorylation of the cardiac myosin motor-associated regulatory light chain (RLC) by cardiac myosin light chain kinase (cMLCK) has been recognized as a key signaling pathway to increase myocardial contractile function, little is known about its molecular mechanism of action. Here, we show that phosphorylation of RLC is not a stochastic process but a spatially tightly controlled mechanism in the cardiac sarcomere. Myosin motors in the region of the thick filament associated with cardiac myosin binding protein-C (cMyBP-C) are the primary target for phosphorylation by cMLCK. Moreover, we show that phosphorylation of RLC likely only leads to activation of one of the two myosin motors of the dimeric cardiac myosin molecule. Using a combination of structural measurements using bifunctional fluorescent probes on the RLC and spatially explicit modeling we show that RLC phosphorylation increases the force-dependent recruitment of the myosin motors. We propose that RLC phosphorylation exerts its functional effects via increasing the gain of the mechanosignaling between different zones of the thick filament. A better mechanistic understanding of the role of RLC phosphorylation likely underpins the development of therapeutic interventions for both heart disease and heart failure.",

Here, we determine the crystal structure of MPXV A30/H2 subcomplex via the tandem-fusion strategy, and show that A30 undergoes large conformational rearrangements upon H2 binding. Structural analysis reveals extended intersubunit interface and highly conserved intermolecular interactions. In vitro binding data further clarify key residues and elements involved in the A30/H2 subcomplex formation. Finally, we show that the H2-A30 fusion protein, superior to A30 ectodomain alone or the ectodomain-mixture of H2+A30, can induce more potent neutralizing-antibody responses which could inhibit viral infection. These data provide valuable information for the understanding of poxvirus EFC assembly and the H2-A30-based immunogen design and optimization.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Bahnar language, a member of the Northern Bahnaric branch of the Mon-Khmer family, shows distinctive register contrasts that provide important insights into the process of registrogenesis. This paper studies register variation across three major dialects of Bahnar (spoken in Bình Định, Gia Lai and Kon Tum provinces of Vietnam) based on production acoustic data collected from 48 native speakers. The authors analyze several phonetic parameters, including fundamental frequency (F0), vowel quality, voice quality, voice onset time (VOT) and vowel duration and focus on the correlation between initial consonants and the following vowels. The findings show clear dialectal differences: Bình Định displays a particularly lower register and complex devoicing patterns in initial consonants, while Gia Lai and Kon Tum rely more on spectral and temporal cues. These patterns suggest that Bahnar is experiencing transphonologization, with registers compensating for the weakening of initial consonant voicing. Beyond collecting regional variation data, the paper also explores sociophonetic variation. It contributes to the understanding of the phonetic mechanisms that drive registrogenesis in Austroasiatic languages and highlights the role of social factors in influencing Bahnar phonology.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background : High-tunnel tomato production technology has emerged as a vital technology in western Amhara, Ethiopia, to address the production challenges during the rainy season. However, its productivity is low, mainly because of the absence of recommended rates of N and P nutrients. Therefore, two-year experiments were conducted in the 2023 and 2024 main seasons to optimize N and P nutrients. Methods : The experiment involved four levels of nitrogen (0, 160, 320, and 480 kg N ha −1 ) and four levels of phosphorus (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg P 2 O 5 ha −1 ), arranged in a factorial RCBD with three replications. Phenology, growth, yield, and quality data were collected and analyzed using R software V.4.0. Results : The results revealed that the combined application of N and P fertilizers significantly ( P &lt; 0.01) affected the productivity of tomato. The combined application of 320/120 kg ha −1 N/P 2 O 5 was the optimal combination for flower number cluster −1 (7.71), fruit number cluster −1 (6.27), fruit set percentage (81.15%), marketable yield (88.21 tons ha −1 ), total yield (90.71 tons ha −1 ), fruit firmness (13.01 N), and total soluble solids (4.37 °Brix). Conversely, the lowest performance was observed in the untreated plots and plots treated with either of the two nutrients. The regression analysis found that the combination rate can be extended up to 358/128 kg ha −1 N/P 2 O 5 for maximum yield. Conclusion : This combination greatly enhanced tomato productivity and provided the highest net benefit of 3,506,745.00 ETB ha −1 with a marginal rate of return of 2370.5%, which is recommended for high-tunnel tomato production in the study area.",

This case series explores the use of clinical hypnosis as a treatment to attenuate comorbid mental symptoms and enhance quality of life for individuals with VCFS. Sixteen cases aged 6 to 38 with genetically confirmed VCFS and psychological disorders were taught self-hypnosis and positive reframing. Caregivers assisted participants with practicing self-hypnosis and monitoring progress. Outcomes were assessed qualitatively based on symptomatic improvements reported by caregivers and patients across clinical visits. Treatment efficacy appeared influenced by patient engagement, caregiver support, and strategically directed hypnotic suggestions. Findings suggest therapy with hypnosis appears to be a low-cost, non-pharmacological approach for reducing anxiety, improving emotional-regulation, and alleviating some psychotic symptoms in VCFS.",

    "Abstract": "1. This experiment examined the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of aniseed oil (AO) in meat emulsions. Spices are integral part of emulsion-based products imparting desirable flavours. In the search for chemical-free preservatives, these spices hold promising potential for extending the shelf-life of meat emulsions.2. Three different levels of aniseed essential oil viz. AO1 (0.25%), AO2 (0.5%), AO3 (0.75%) and control C (without aniseed essential oil) were incorporated in chicken meat emulsions. Samples were assessed for changes in physico-chemical, antioxidant activity, lipid oxidation, microbiological parameters and visual sensory scores during refrigerated storage under aerobic packaging. Samples were evaluated at a regular interval of 3 d until the appearance of incipient spoilage.3. Titratable acidity, emulsion stability and extract release volume decreased significantly, whereas pH value increased (<i>p</i> < 0.05) among all samples throughout storage. Total phenolic, 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline)-6-sulphonic and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl acid per cent inhibition increased as the level of aniseed oil incorporation increased among groups. However, this value reduced considerably (<i>p</i> < 0.05) during storage.4. Peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, free fatty acid content and microbial quality parameters increased (<i>p</i> < 0.05) by the end of storage. Visual sensory attributes score of AO2 were rated higher than AO3, although sensory score declined (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in all groups during storage.5. The results showed that AO2 maintained better sensorial characteristics than AO3 and sustained physicochemical, antioxidant and antimicrobial activity compared to the control, AO1.",

Current models cannot account for different performance patterns between delayed naming and repetition tasks within the same individual.One key way that naming differs from repetition is the duration of stimulus exposure. We investigated the contribution of stimulus duration to temporal processing variability in aphasia. 19 PWA completed tests of immediate and delayed naming and repetition. Pictures in short-exposure naming appeared for only 100 ms, whereas pictures in the long exposure condition appeared for3000 ms. While this manipulation did not eliminate diverging performance accuracy between delayed naming and repetition, shortening picture duration did increase task difficulty and revealed greater variability in temporal processing. We discuss the role of visual semantic activation in the time course of word retrieval.",

    "Abstract": "Interpreting Indian tax law is challenging due to frequent legislative amendments, complex statutory structures, and the requirement for precise citation. This paper presents TaxFlow, a domain-specific legal assistant that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with the LLaMA-3 language model for statutory question answering. The system is trained on a curated corpus of Indian tax statutes, government gazettes, and case law, processed through structured extraction, segmentation, and dense–sparse indexing. TaxFlow incorporates temporal validity filtering to ensure that retrieved provisions reflect the legally effective version at query time. The architecture combines FAISS-based retrieval, legal-domain adapters, and critique-driven generation to reduce hallucinations and improve citation fidelity. Evaluation is conducted on a unified Indian tax law benchmark using automatic metrics. Experimental results show that TaxFlow achieves 96.5% accuracy and a 95.0% F1-score, demonstrating consistent and substantial improvements over representative baseline systems, while BLEU and ROUGE-L scores demonstrate significant improvements in linguistic quality. The findings confirm the effectiveness of domain-adapted hybrid RAG systems for reliable and scalable legal assistance.",

    "Abstract": "Immigrants in Germany experience elevated rates of mental health challenges, often stemming from identity confusion and acculturative stress. Addressing the critical shortage of culturally sensitive mental health services, this study investigates the efficacy of integrating Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) into an immersive art exhibition as a low-intensity intervention. Ten young adult immigrants residing in Bremen participated in a four-station audiovisual experience designed to physically manifest ACT principles: Creative Hopelessness (process of recognizing controlling experiences leads to suffocation), Acceptance (process of making space for any emotions), Cognitive Defusion (ability to distance thoughts from self), and Values (what matters in life). Reflexive Thematic Analysis of post-intervention interviews revealed that the immersive environment successfully facilitated psychological flexibility. Participants reported a shift from cognitive entanglement to flow of mind, noting that multisensory aesthetics helped externalize difficult thoughts and foster an 'Observer Self' perspective. However, limitations regarding cultural personalization and sensory intensity were identified. The findings suggest that immersive arts can effectively translate abstract therapeutic rationales (i.e. ACT) into tangible experiences and conclude that ACT-integrated immersive art represents a promising alternative to bridge the service gap for minority populations. Nevertheless, future research is required to optimize personalization and quantify efficacy.",

    "Abstract": "With the advancement of modern medicine and engineering, breast deformation analysis has become increasingly important in the fields such as cosmetic surgery, reconstructive surgery, sports biomechanics, and health-related research. The morphological changes in breast tissue not only affect an individual's aesthetic appearance and mental well-being but are also closely linked to breast health. Finite Element Method (FEM) and Machine Learning (ML) are two advanced technologies that exhibit significant potential in breast deformation analysis. FEM plays a crucial role in modeling the mechanical behavior of breast soft tissues and analyzing deformations due to its precise numerical solutions and realistic simulation capabilities. On the other hand, machine learning techniques provide new perspectives for personalized health management and disease risk assessment by processing large-scale breast morphology data to uncover patterns and correlations. This paper reviews the latest advancements in the application of FEM and ML in breast tissue morphology analysis, explores their potential and challenges in simulating both static and dynamic breast deformations in clinical practice, and summarizes the characteristics and application scenarios of both technologies. This paper discusses the novel opportunities brought by the integration of these two approaches for the clinical diagnosis and analysis of breast-related diseases. It synthesizes these developments and explores the potential benefits of methodological integration for future breast morphology-related research and clinical applications.",

    "Abstract": "Oral insulin delivery represents a transformative approach to diabetes management, offering improved patient compliance and physiological insulin delivery patterns compared to subcutaneous injection. However, multiple gastrointestinal barriers, including enzymatic degradation, mucus entrapment, epithelial impermeability, and first-pass metabolism, have limited oral bioavailability to below 1% for unmodified insulin. This review comprehensively examines contemporary strategies to overcome these barriers. We analyze structural modifications of insulin, including PEGylation, lipidation, cyclization, and glycoengineering, which enhance stability while maintaining biological activity. The analysis extends to sophisticated formulation technologies incorporating nanocarriers (polymer-based, lipid-based, inorganic nanocarriers, and metal organic frameworks), biomimetic systems, and stimuli-responsive mechanisms for protection and delivery. A central focus is on absorption-enhancing strategies, which range from chemical permeation enhancers to precise biological mechanisms like receptor-mediated transcytosis and other active transport pathways. Emerging tools such as microbiome-based carriers and smart devices are also discussed. Despite significant progress in preclinical models, challenges remain in manufacturing scalability, inter-patient variability, long-term safety, and regulatory approval. Future directions emphasize hybrid delivery systems, digital health integration, and personalized formulations. Realizing clinically viable oral insulin requires continued multidisciplinary collaboration addressing biological, technological, and translational barriers to transform diabetes care.",

Maintaining access to Sipavibart remains justified, as future antigenic shifts could restore its activity. Its deployment should rely on genomic surveillance and local epidemiology.

    "Abstract": "The development of lightweight and high-performance materials is vital for improving automotive efficiency and reducing environmental impact. This study investigates the synergistic influence of chemical treatment and graphene reinforcement on the mechanical and microstructural behavior of hybrid bio-composites fabricated using Syzygium cumini and Morinda tinctoria fibers. Hybrid composites were produced in varying resin-to-fiber ratios (65:35, 70:30, 75:25) with 1–2 wt.% graphene nanoplatelets uniformly dispersed in an epoxy matrix, and fibers subjected to alkaline treatment to enhance interfacial compatibility. Mechanical characterization revealed a substantial improvement in treated, graphene-modified composites, including a ~ 39% increase in tensile strength, a ~ 30% rise in flexural strength, and a ~ 27% enhancement in impact resistance compared to untreated counterparts. Water absorption decreased by up to 45%, while hardness values increased notably, reflecting improved surface integrity. SEM analysis confirmed superior interfacial adhesion, reduced voids, and uniform graphene dispersion, while FTIR, XRD, and TGA results verified enhanced structural order, chemical stability, and thermal resistance. The combined effects of graphene infusion and chemical treatment significantly elevate fiber – matrix bonding and overall composite performance. These findings establish the treated graphene-reinforced S. cumini/M. tinctoria hybrid composite as a promising lightweight material for structural automotive components, particularly bonnet applications.",

    "Abstract": "The effectiveness of face coverings against respiratory viruses is crucial for public health but often lacks realistic performance assessments of protection and comfort. In this study, a system-level test method was developed using an animatronic headform to incorporate fit and dynamic wear into the assessment of total filtration efficacy of medical masks and barrier face coverings. Six commercially available products were evaluated, including an N95 respirator as the control. Total filtration efficacy was calculated from differential particle counts recorded inside and outside of face coverings each minute. The baseline method was able to statistically differentiate between products to a difference in means of 5% at a particle size of 0.3 μm optical diameter. The 16 and 28 L/min sinusoidal flow rates significantly impacted total filtration efficacy, as did the influence of headform movement and duration of wear for select products. There were statistical differences between operators at both flow rates for the KN95 and surgical style masks that were difficult to don consistently, highlighting the variability in performance due to fit. However, the product type remained the most significant cause of variance in the method at 66.10%, demonstrating that the headform test method was able to repeatedly and reproducibly evaluate the efficacy of various face coverings. Furthermore, there were significant decreases in filtration when the facepiece was not sealed properly due to poor fit. This highlights the importance of evaluating these source control devices, including barrier face coverings and public use of medical masks, as they are intended to be worn to incorporate their fit into the reported results.",

    "Abstract": "Ginseng's prolonged development renders it susceptible to environmental stresses. Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are essential for plant resistance to abiotic stress. Our previous study demonstrated that <i>PgLEA2-50</i>, a member of the LEA protein family, plays a significant role in stress resistance. In this study, we employed IP-MS, bioinformatics, and molecular interaction assays to investigate the mechanisms underlying its stress resistance. PgLEA2-50 formed complex networks with multiple interacting proteins, which were enriched in stress-related processes such as gibberellin (GA) signal transduction, saponin biosynthesis, and the oxidative stress response. Transcriptome analysis revealed that its interacting targets exhibited significant responses to abiotic stress at the transcriptional level. An investigation of the DELLA protein PgRGA4 showed that it was down-regulated following GA induction, with its transcriptional activity inhibited under stress conditions. <i>PgRGA4</i> was found to be localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and co-immunoprecipitation (CO-IP) confirmed its interaction with PgLEA2-50, suggesting that PgLEA2-50 indirectly regulates GA-mediated stress resistance. This study provides a ginseng-specific case for the role of LEA proteins in stress resistance and identifies a novel gene target for molecular breeding in medicinal plants.",

    "Abstract": "Annelids represent one of the most important invertebrate groups in marine environments, yet their diversity and distribution are affected by knowledge gaps. In this study, marine annelids occurring along the Salento Peninsula were reviewed, based on 120 literature sources, 72 of which include georeferenced data, and new samples collected in the years 2022–2025 in several different environments. Aside from georeferenced occurrences and ecological traits, the data also included information on reproduction and development. In addition, barcoding data based on two mitochondrial markers (16S rDNA and COI) were obtained for a total of 208 nominal species. The evidence from literature and new data allowed the reporting of 715 species along the Salento Peninsula, 23 of which are potentially new to science, and 45 non-indigenous. The available data showed a density skewed towards the areas of Taranto and Porto Cesareo, while the remaining coast of Salento remains poorly explored. A similar unevenness accounts for taxonomic groups; while some families (such as Syllidae and Sabellidae) were overall well known according to the literature, some families (such as Scalibregmatidae) were historically almost completely unknown in the area. Barcoding data confirmed the distinctness of some of the potential new species, but revealed the occurrence of multiple mitochondrial lineages in 64 nominal species (32% of all assayed species), supporting the hypothesis of widespread occurrence of cryptic diversity in Mediterranean marine annelids and allowing us to identify possible case studies for future research. Three allegedly native species showed genetic matches with individuals sampled in other geographical areas, suggesting the occurrence of human-mediated translocation. Conversely, a minor portion of the species showed genetic homogeneity despite morphological differences. These results confirm the importance of the Salento Peninsula as a marine biodiversity hotspot and stress the need for further detailed research on marine annelids even in the relatively well-known Mediterranean Sea.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Using computational chemistry, we have scanned a set of four-membered N-heterocyclic carbenes with bulky substituents for their ability to form carbene metal amides (CMAs) with excellent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) properties. In comparison to the properties of their well-known five- and six-membered analogs, the transition dipole moments of the first excited singlet states of the corresponding Cu (I) carbazolide (Cz) complexes increase. For CMAs of the most promising four-membered carbene, a&amp;#xD;lactam-based carbene (4LAC), detailed investigations of the TADF properties have been performed using advanced quantum chemical methods. Due to the small energy separation between its singlet and triplet ligand-to-ligand charge-transfer (LLCT) states,&amp;#xD;4LAC–Ag (I) –Cz exhibits the best ratio between reverse intersystem crossing (rISC) and intersystem crossing in the coinage metal triad for a coplanar orientation of the ligands. The TADF properties of the corresponding Cu (I) and Au (I) complexes benefit from twisted ligand–ligand alignments, achieved by using tetrafluorocarbazolide (4FCz) as donor ligand. The moderate reduction of the fluorescence rate constant upon twisting by about 45-50° is overcompensated by a decrease of the singlet–triplet energy gap, thus improving the TADF performance. Overall, with fluorescence rate constants of the order of 10 7 s −1 and rISC rate constants between 10 9 and 10 10 s −1 , TADF should have competitive advantage&amp;#xD;over common triplet deactivation processes such as triplet–triplet annihilation. Like in other CMAs, full excited-state geometry relaxation in liquid solution is detrimental for the emission properties. In the solid state, where the formation of a perpendicular ligand–ligand alignment is sterically hindered by the environment, 4LAC–M–Cz and 4LAC–M–4FCz are predicted to be eﬃcient TADF compounds with red to orange emission.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purple Martins (Progne subis) are migratory aerial insectivores that have experienced a 37% population decline over the past five decades. One hypothesized cause for this decline is exposure to contaminants at their non-breeding grounds. However, non-breeding grounds of Purple Martins extend over 35 degrees latitude in South America, likely resulting in different contaminant exposure scenarios. In this study, we compare total mercury (THg) content in feathers from 247 Purple Martins from two roosts in Brazil: one in the Amazon Basin and another in the Southeast region. We hypothesized that birds in the Amazon region would exhibit the highest feather THg content due to the combined influence of anthropogenic activities and the region’s geological features. However, mean THg feather contents were significantly higher in the Southeast (3.2 ± 1.6 μg g−1) than in the Amazon Basin (1.77 ± 0.81 μg g−1), likely driven by local and regional environmental factors, including industrialization and historical land-use change. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding how the non-breeding range of migratory species may influence their contaminant exposure. This information will assist in the development of conservation strategies tailored to the unique environmental conditions migratory species are exposed to throughout their annual cycles.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Maltose is one of the most abundant sugars in brewer’s wort, and its efficient utilization is critical for successful fermentation. However, maltose consumption varies naturally among Saccharomyces eubayanus strains isolated from different host trees, such as Quercus and Nothofagus. To identify the genetic determinants underlying these phenotypic differences, we performed bulk segregant analysis (BSA) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping using an F2 offspring derived from QC18 (Quercus-associated) and CL467.1 (Nothofagus-associated) strains. QTL mapping identified two significant genomic regions on subtelomeric loci of chromosomes V-R and XVI-L, each containing complete MAL loci composed of MAL32 (encoding maltase), MAL31 (transporter), and MAL33 (transcriptional activator) genes. Comparative polymorphism analyses identified mutations in MAL32 and MAL33 of QC18, including frameshift mutations resulting in premature stop codons. Functional validation demonstrated that the heterologous expression of MAL33ChrV from CL467.1 fully restored maltose utilization in QC18, indicating the functional presence of MAL33 cis-regulatory sequences and MAL32 and MAL31 genes in QC18. While structural protein predictions identified truncation and impaired functionality in the maltose-responsive activation domain of Mal33p from QC18, overexpression of QC18’s own MAL33ChrV allele also improved maltose metabolism, suggesting dosage-dependent transcriptional limitations rather than complete functional loss. These results indicate that allelic variations in the maltose-responsive activation domain of Mal33p result in differences in maltose consumption between strains. We hypothesized that reduced maltose metabolism in QC18 is an adaptive response to the distinct sugar composition in Quercus robur bark, contrasting with the starch-rich environment of Nothofagus pumilio. These findings highlight subtelomeric MAL gene diversity as a reservoir of genetic variation, representing a key evolutionary mechanism that influences maltose adaptation among natural Saccharomyces isolates.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The genome is compacted in the nucleus through a hierarchical chromatin organization, ranging from chromosome territories to compartments, topologically associating domains (TADs), and individual nucleosomes. Nucleosome remodeling complexes hydrolyze ATP to translocate DNA and thereby mobilize histone proteins. While nucleosome remodeling complexes have been extensively studied for their roles in regulating nucleosome positioning and accessibility, their contributions to higher-order chromatin architecture remain less well understood. Here, we investigate the roles of two key nucleosome remodelers, esBAF and INO8°C, in shaping 3D genome organization in mouse embryonic stem cells. Using Hi-C, we find that loss of either remodeler has minimal effects on global compartment or TAD structures. In contrast, subcompartment organization is notably altered, suggesting that esBAF and INO8°C contribute to finer-scale chromatin topology. To overcome the limited resolution of Hi-C for detecting regulatory loops, we employed promoter capture Micro-C (PCMC), which revealed that the loss of esBAF or INO8°C alters a subset of promoter anchored looping interactions. Although these changes occur at distinct genomic loci for each remodeler, the affected sites are commonly enriched for bivalent chromatin regions bound by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG (OSN), as well as BRG1 and INO80 themselves. Together, our findings reveal that esBAF and INO8°C selectively influence subcompartment identity and enhancer-promoter communication at key regulatory loci, highlighting a previously underappreciated role for nucleosome remodelers in higher-order chromatin organization.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives Sickle cell disease is one of the most prevalent inherited hemoglobin disorders globally, affecting over 300,000 newborns annually, with the majority born in sub-Saharan Africa. Children with sickle cell disease are particularly vulnerable to severe bacterial infections, which are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Among these, Salmonella species, especially non-typhoidal Salmonella, are frequently implicated and are notably associated with osteomyelitis, a serious bone infection. In this study, we performed whole genome sequencing and genomic analysis of 12 Salmonella isolates recovered from osteomyelitis cases in children with sickle cell disease in Dakar, Senegal. Methods The isolates’ identity was confirmed using a MALDI-TOF biotyper and antimicrobial susceptibility testing carried out using the disc diffusion method. Whole-genome sequencing was conducted on an Illumina platform and bioinformatic analyses carried out using open-access and custom tools. Results The isolates belonged to seven serovars, with Enteritidis and Typhimurium being the most frequent (three isolates each). Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed that 11 isolates were fully susceptible to all tested drugs, while one was an extensively drug-resistant strain previously linked to a nosocomial outbreak in a neonatal unit. Most of the isolates contained important Salmonella virulence factors including several Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands and plasmid-borne virulence genes. Conclusion These findings highlight the clinical significance of Salmonella infections in children with sickle cell disease in low-income settings and underscore the urgent need for genomic surveillance and targeted public health interventions to protect this high-risk population.",

    "Abstract": "Plexiform neurofibromas (PNs) are a hallmark of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), affecting ∼50% of individuals with the condition. Originating from Schwann cells and other peripheral nerve sheath components, these tumors can cause significant morbidity, including functional impairment, diminished health-related quality of life, chronic pain, and malignant transformation. Managing NF1-PNs is challenging because of disease variability, differing growth rates, and age-related differences in clinical presentation and treatment tolerability. This review examines current therapeutic strategies, including surgery, medical therapies, and emerging treatments, emphasizing individualized care. Highlighted here is the need for age-specific treatment planning, particularly as disease progression, comorbidities, and side-effect profiles differ between pediatric and adult patients. Optimizing outcomes requires personalized surveillance and coordinated multidisciplinary management across all age groups. While MEK inhibitors (MEKi) provide therapeutic benefit, their long-term efficacy and safety, particularly in pediatric patients who may receive these agents for extended periods, warrant further investigation. Additionally, adult patients face unique comorbidities that may complicate therapy. Superficial PNs and potential MEK inhibitor resistance remain underexplored. Growing interest in combination therapies and adjuvant strategies may improve outcomes. Ongoing research is crucial to personalize treatment regimens, to identify effective combinations, and to refine surveillance protocols, ultimately enhancing long-term quality of life for individuals living with NF1-PN.",

    "Abstract": "Potato mop-top virus (PMTV) is a significant pathogen causing potato \"spraing\" disease worldwide. The PMTV 8K protein functions as a weak viral suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR), has viroporin activity and plays a role in pathogenicity by promoting viral long-distance movement and modulating host responses. Uniquely, PMTV can establish systemic infection in the absence of the 8K protein, though the infection is slightly delayed. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying PMTV-host interactions, we conducted comprehensive RNA-seq analysis comparing wild-type PMTV with a mutant lacking the 8K gene (PMTV-Δ8K) in Nicotiana benthamiana. Our transcriptomic analysis shows that wild-type PMTV and PMTV-Δ8K elicit largely distinct transcriptional responses in the host, with more unique than shared differentially expressed genes. The analysis also revealed extensive reprogramming of metabolic pathways, stress responses, and defense mechanisms. Notably, wild-type PMTV induced more defense-related transcription factors, including 27 WRKY genes compared to 8 in PMTV-Δ8K infections. RNA silencing pathway genes displayed distinct expression patterns, with AGO2, RDR1, and AGO-MEL1 showing notably enhanced upregulation (up to 9.7-fold) in PMTV-Δ8K infections. Functional analysis identified chloroplast-associated genes GNS2, CHUP1, and KIN5l as host restriction factors. Virus-induced gene silencing experiments confirmed that GNS2 and CHUP1 restrict viral accumulation under both infection scenarios (wild-type PMTV and PMTV-Δ8K), while localization studies revealed that TGB2 protein and GNS2 co-localize at chloroplast structures. These findings provide insights into PMTV pathogenesis, suggest that 8K is a multifunctional protein operating through diverse mechanisms, and advance understanding of viral suppression strategies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Parasites can induce changes in their hosts, favoring the success of the infection and its development at each stage of their life cycle. The host minimizes the effects of the parasite's presence through its defense system, balancing the parasite–host relationship. The intricate parasite–host relationship provides physiological, immunological, and molecular cues that suggest interaction and mutual regulation of the transcriptome and epigenome, promoting phenotypic plasticity and survival in a changing environment. There has been a growing interest in the epigenetic mechanisms of Schistosoma mansoni , a parasite with remarkable phenotypic plasticity in response to signals from the environment and its hosts. Several studies emphasize the epigenetic mechanisms behind the phenotypic plasticity of Schistosoma . Regarding the host's gene expression in the face of infection, however, there is little evidence of which pathways are altered by the passage of the parasite through the lungs and by the pathogenesis in the hepatic portal system. In this work, we characterized S. mansoni infection in parasitological and biochemical aspects of the murine model in comparison with the profile of the initial, acute, and chronic phases of infection (3, 7, and 20 wpi (weeks postinfection), respectively). The biochemical and morphological results of the infection at 3, 7, and 20 wpi show the phenotypic changes of schistosomiasis in the murine model. ATAC‐seq (Assay for Transposase‐Accessible Chromatin using sequencing) at 7 wpi shows a chromatin with higher accessibility for infected individuals, and Western blotting at 7 wpi shows an increase in histone marks H3K9ac and H3K9me3, indicating a change in chromatin status after infection. RNA‐seq (RNA sequencing) for 7 wpi results show a differential profile of lipid metabolism genes that are negatively modulated, while immune system genes are positively modulated. It is interesting to note that the negative modulation of mRNA expression of lipid pathway genes causes the rates of these metabolites to appear decreased in the blood, while the increased expression of immune system defense genes is in accordance with liver histology data, which shows an inflammatory profile.",

    "Abstract": "Background. Since current opioid overdose deaths occur mainly from potent synthetic opioids with high affinity for the opioid receptor, such as fentanyl and carfentanil, it is important to determine the efficacy of naloxone, particularly the intranasal formulation, in reversing opioid-induced respiratory depression. This study evaluated effectiveness of 4 mg intranasal naloxone (Narcan ® ) in reversing moderate respiratory depression induced by fentanyl and sufentanil, in opioid-naïve individuals and self-reported daily opioid users. Sufentanil was compared to fentanyl because of its higher affinity for the opioid receptor than fentanyl. Methods. In this prospective, crossover trial, 12 opioid-naïve individuals and 18 daily opioid users (morphine milligram equivalent of 291 (range 60-2250 mg/day) received continuous fentanyl or sufentanil infusions, titrated to achieve 30-40% reduction in ventilation (V̇ E ). Participants were administered Narcan ® during steady-state respiratory depression. Primary endpoints included time to reversal of diminished V̇ E and elevated end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (pCO 2 ). Results. Narcan ® restored V̇ E within 2-4 min across all participants but showed delayed reversal of end-tidal pCO 2 (11-17 min), with pCO 2 recovery during sufentanil exposure in just 8 opioid-naïve individuals and 10 daily opioid users. Hysteresis analysis showed for V̇ E -reversal onset/offset time (blood-effect-site equilibration half-life) of 0-1 min and end-tidal pCO 2 2-11 min. Because of withdrawal symptoms, seven of eighteen daily opioid users participated once in the study. Study limitations included continuous opioid infusions that do not occur in real-world overdose settings. Conclusion. A single Narcan ® dose reversed moderate fentanyl- and sufentanil-induced respiratory depression, though effectiveness varied by endpoint and opioid receptor affinity. Rapid V̇ E -recovery suggests clinical utility of intranasal naloxone, but delayed and sometimes incomplete recovery of end-tidal pCO 2 , particularly during exposure to the high-affinity opioid sufentanil, indicating reversal inefficacy and persistence of respiratory instability. Further studies are needed to address optimal naloxone doses and alternative formulations to address high-dose potent opioid threats.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To provide real-world data to inform benchmarking goals and practical issues that influence optimal antenatal corticosteroid timing and to examine patient factors, such as gestational age at steroid administration and presenting diagnoses, associated with steroid administration in relation to delivery. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of singleton deliveries between July 1, 2016, and December 31, 2024, at two large academic hospitals with level IV neonatal intensive care units in a single health system. The primary cohort of interest was individuals who delivered between 24 0/7 and 33 6/7 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome of interest was the timing of antenatal corticosteroid administration in relation to delivery, categorized as none, delivery between 6 hours and 7 days after the first dose of antenatal corticosteroid (“optimally timed” per the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine’s quality metric), and delivery less than 6 hours or more than 7 days after the first dose of antenatal corticosteroid (“suboptimally timed”). As a balancing measure to optimally timed antenatal corticosteroid administration, we also examined those who received antenatal corticosteroids before 34 weeks of gestation and delivered at term (after 37 weeks). We reported the rates of optimal timing and term delivery by their corresponding weeks of gestation and performed multivariable logistic regression modeling to understand patient factors and diagnoses associated with antenatal corticosteroid timing. RESULTS: Among the 1,694 pregnant patients who delivered before 34 weeks of gestation, 961 (56.7%) had optimally timed antenatal corticosteroid administration, 162 (9.6%) received the first dose of antenatal corticosteroids less than 6 hours before delivery, 320 (18.9%) delivered more than 7 days after antenatal corticosteroid administration, and 251 (14.8%) did not receive antenatal corticosteroids. Of those who received antenatal steroids before 34 weeks of gestation, 747 of 2,879 (25.9%) delivered at term. There was little variation in optimal timing or term delivery by gestational age. Clinical factors associated with optimally timed antenatal corticosteroid administration compared with delivery more than 7 days after administration included pregnancy-related hypertensive disorder (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.88, 95% CI, 1.31–2.69), preterm labor (aOR 2.78, 95% CI, 1.32–5.81), premature rupture of membranes (1.37, 95% CI, 1.33–1.42), anxiety disorder (aOR 079, 95% CI, 0.76–0.83), multiparous with no history of preterm birth (aOR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.77–0.86), placenta previa (aOR 0.76, 95% CI, 0.68–0.84), and placenta accreta (aOR 0.83, 95% CI, 0.81–0.85). CONCLUSION: Achieving optimal timing of antenatal corticosteroid administration remains challenging. These findings underscore the need for improved prediction of preterm delivery and individualized patient assessment to ensure timely access to antenatal corticosteroids for women at risk of preterm birth while reducing unnecessary exposure.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Evidence related to anemia in early pregnancy, and its resolution or persistence by late pregnancy, is limited. We evaluated pregnancy outcomes associated with anemia in early pregnancy and resolution compared with persistence in late pregnancy. METHODS: We used the Merative™ Marketscan ® Commercial Database of nationwide insurance claims (2018–2023) and included pregnant individuals without hereditary anemias. We used hemoglobin and hematocrit to identify anemia in early pregnancy (before 14 weeks of gestation) and late pregnancy (at or after 24 weeks of gestation). Pregnancy outcomes included preeclampsia, placenta previa, placental abruption, severe postpartum hemorrhage, blood products transfusion, cesarean birth, nontransfusion severe maternal morbidity (SMM), spontaneous preterm birth, medically indicated preterm birth, and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) birth weight. We used modified Poisson regression to estimate associations between: 1) anemia in early pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes; and 2) anemia resolution by late pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes, adjusting for confounders by inverse probability weighting. RESULTS: Among 73,586 individuals, 4.4% (95% CI, 4.3–4.6%) had anemia in early pregnancy. Early pregnancy anemia was associated with higher risk of each outcome assessed, with the exception of placenta previa, with the highest associated risk of blood products transfusion (2.4% vs 0.8%; adjusted risk ratio [aRR] 2.45; 95% CI, 1.91–3.13). Of those with early pregnancy anemia and laboratory values in late pregnancy (72.1%), 53.4% had persistent anemia and 46.6% had resolved anemia. Persistent anemia was associated with nontransfusion SMM (2.6% vs 1.1%, aRR 1.64; 95% CI, 1.13–2.37), blood products transfusion (2.9% vs 0.8%, aRR 2.60; 95% CI, 1.84–3.69), and SGA birth weight (8.5% vs 6.8%, aRR 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01–1.50), compared with those without anemia in the first trimester. The resolution of anemia by late pregnancy was not associated with nontransfusion SMM (1.6% vs 1.1%; aRR 1.07; 95% CI, 0.65–1.74) but was associated with blood products transfusion (1.6% vs 0.8%; aRR 1.64; 95% CI, 1.01–2.67) and SGA birth weight (10.0% vs 6.8%; aRR 1.38; 95% CI, 1.15–1.67) compared with those without anemia in the first trimester. CONCLUSION: Anemia in the first trimester was associated with adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. The resolution of anemia by late pregnancy eliminated the association with nontransfusion SMM but not other outcomes, emphasizing the importance of treating anemia in early pregnancy and before pregnancy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Esophageal perforation is one of the most challenging complications related to anterior cervical spine surgery. Although the perioperative complication profile of anterior cervical disc replacement (ACDR) is similar to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), esophageal perforation and its management have not been reported in the setting of ACDR. Case Report: We present a case of a 61-year-old woman who experienced delayed esophageal perforation five weeks after ACDR. She presented to the emergency department with severe neck pain, dysphagia, dysphonia, and subcutaneous emphysema. Gastrografin swallow study and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) demonstrated a small (&lt;1 cm) esophageal tear. This defect was successfully repaired with an endoscopic clip without the need for a vascularized flap. Surgical anterior neck exploration confirmed adequate esophageal repair and well-fixated hardware. Early oral intake was initiated on hospital day 8, and the patient was discharged home on antibiotics by day 10. The endoscopic clip was successfully removed after eight weeks. The prosthetic disc was preserved and continued to function at one-year follow-up after the index operation. Discussion: Esophageal perforation after anterior cervical spine surgery is a rare complication that carries high mortality rates, especially in delayed cases. Early diagnosis and intervention are key to alleviating morbidity associated with this injury. Current operative management includes direct repair augmented with vascularized flaps. This is typically accompanied by delayed oral intake and often requires the placement of a gastroenteric feeding tube. Successful esophageal repair was achieved in this case with the use of an endoscopic clip without the use of a vascularized flap. This treatment allowed for early oral feeding and quicker hospital discharge. Conclusions: Successful esophageal repair using an endoscopic clip was performed in this case of delayed esophageal perforation after ACDR. Endoscopic repair without the need for a vascularized flap may be advantageous in the setting of small tears and low-profile construct designs as they offer quicker recovery and early oral nutrition in comparison to direct repair augmented with vascularized flaps.",

    "Abstract": "Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Objective: Compare short-term outcomes after cervical laminoplasty (LP) versus laminectomy with fusion (LF) for central cord syndrome (CCS). Background: CCS is the most common incomplete spinal cord injury. LP preserves motion and may reduce perioperative risk; LF is favored with instability or kyphosis. Large multicenter data can clarify early safety and utilization. Methods: Adults with CCS undergoing LP or LF were identified in the TriNetX Network. Cervical fracture, infection, and neoplasm were excluded. One-to-one propensity score matching on demographics and comorbidities created balanced cohorts (n=196 per group). Outcomes at 30, 60, and 90 days included health care utilization (readmission, emergency department/outpatient visits, physical therapy), medical complications, neurological events (sensory deficit, pain, gait abnormality, bowel/bladder dysfunction), and opioid exposure. Between-group differences were summarized as odds ratios (95% CI) with two-sided P values (α=0.05). Results: Among 1046 eligible patients (LF 811; LP 235), 196 per group were matched. Through 90 days, readmission, emergency department use, physical therapy, composite medical complications, neurological endpoints, and opioid exposure did not differ. Outpatient visits were higher at 30 days after LP (22.6% vs . 14.6%; P =0.030) but not at 60 or 90 days. Several infrequent surgical outcomes (hematoma, surgical-site infection, wound dehiscence, early implant failure, conversion to fusion, and revision subtypes) were not estimable because of small-cell suppression; dural tear/cerebrospinal fluid leak was 0 in both groups. Conclusions: LP and LF showed comparable short-term safety and utilization. Beyond a transient rise in 30-day outpatient visits after LP, no meaningful differences—including opioid exposure—were observed. LP is a reasonable short-term alternative to LF for selected CCS patients. Longer follow-up is needed to assess rare device-related events.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to determine nursing students’ perceived opinion leadership toward social media influencers and their attitudes toward the nursing profession, examine the relationship between these variables, and assess the effect of perceived opinion leadership on professional attitude. Using a descriptive, cross-sectional design, data were collected through the Demographic Characteristics Form, the Opinion Leadership Scale of Social Media Influencers Among Followers, and the Attitude Scale Toward the Nursing Profession. The study was conducted between October 2024 and May 2025 with 674 nursing students from a university in western Turkey. Reporting followed the STROBE checklist. The mean score for opinion leadership was 52.25±16.43, while the mean score for professional attitude was 155.94±20.43. Structural equation modeling showed that the Proximity dimension had a significant positive effect, and the Imitation dimension had a significant negative effect on all subdimensions of professional attitude ( P &lt;.01). The Entertainment dimension positively influenced only the General Status subdimension ( P =.035). Students perceived social media influencers as low-level opinion leaders but held positive attitudes toward nursing. Although overall opinion leadership showed no direct effect on attitudes, its subdimensions had significant associations. These findings highlight the impact of social media dynamics and the need for media literacy strategies in nursing education.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background: Visual input supports locomotion through sensorimotor integration. However, the neural mechanisms underlying how the brain adapts to degraded vision are not well understood. This study investigated the effects of visual occlusion on interactions between regions within the sensorimotor network. Methods: Twelve healthy young adults (8 males, 4 females; mean age 24.0 ±2.1 years) were recruited from the Department of Ophthalmology at Peking University Third Hospital between December 2024 and September 2025. Pattern-reversal visual evoked potentials were recorded under both normal vision and visual occlusion condition (Snellen 20/60 acuity). We acquired resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data to calculate the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) focused on visuomotor integration regions. A one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted with three within-subject conditions: seated rest, level walking with normal vision, and level walking with visual occlusion. Results: Stimuli consisted of checkerboard patterns with large (1°) and small (15′) checks. Under 1° visual stimulation, visual occlusion prolonged binocular P100 latency (117.00 ± 8.55 ms vs . 111.81 ± 5.12 ms; 116.78 ± 9.79 ms vs . 110.96 ± 4.28 ms; all P &lt;0.05) and reduced N75–P100 amplitude (5.798 ± 2.372 μV vs . 8.613 ± 3.949 μV; 6.230 ± 2.459 μV vs . 7.453 ± 2.692 μV, all P &lt;0.05). For 15′ stimulation, occlusion decreased both binocular N75–P100 (5.935 ± 3.500 μV vs . 10.794 ± 5.249 μV; 3.991 ± 1.585 μV vs . 10.361 ± 3.143 μV, all P &lt;0.001) and P100–N135 amplitudes (6.218 ± 3.516 μV vs . 12.499 ± 4.236 μV; 4.427 ± 2.218 μV vs . 10.767 ± 4.904 μV, all P &lt;0.001). Rs-fMRI analysis showed reduced ALFF in the right paracentral lobule after walking (peak Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates: 3, –39, 66; P &lt;0.001, F = 14.009). Walking activated multiple visuomotor pathways (all P &lt;0.001), including the bilateral calcarine and middle temporal gyri, the right calcarine and middle frontal gyri, the bilateral supplementary motor area and right cuneus, and the bilateral precentral gyrus and right cerebellar lobule VI. The visual occlusion strengthened FC between the right precentral and the right middle frontal gyri (peak MNI: 27, 57, 27; F = 16.456, P &lt;0.001). Conclusions: Basic visuomotor pathways demonstrate consistent activation to maintain locomotion. Increased functional connectivity between the right precentral and middle frontal gyri serves as a compensatory mechanism for reduced visual input.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose of review Spontaneous control of HIV replication has been primarily associated with cellular immune responses. However, it remains multifactorial, and viral determinants, innate and humoral immune responses could be additional relevant contributors. Furthermore, posttreatment control cases reveal new roles for humoral responses. This review describes the direct, indirect and passive roles of humoral responses in HIV control. Recent findings New evidence supports the role of the humoral responses in the natural control of HIV. Indeed, a strong association has been reported between polyfunctional humoral responses and slow disease progression, highlighting the active role of both neutralizing and nonneutralizing antibodies in natural control. Moreover, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are being considered as therapeutic interventions to directly or indirectly mediate HIV control in cure strategies. Data from the latest clinical trials show that treatment with bNAbs may induce high-quality CD8 T-cell responses, pointing to bNAbs as a major indirect strategy to induce durable HIV control. Finally, humoral responses can serve as biomarkers for monitoring elite controllers and have been useful to identify stable aviremic controllers, providing new clinical monitoring tools. Summary Humoral responses are relevant for understanding immune mechanisms of control, for defining therapeutic interventions and for the clinical follow-up of elite controllers.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), was renamed in 2020 to emphasize its metabolic nature. Presently, modern medicine faces challenges in providing effective treatments for MAFLD. In contrast, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has demonstrated potential in alleviating clinical symptoms and improving the liver function. Modified Linggui Yinchen Decoction (M-LGYCD) is derived from Lingguizhugan and Yinchenhao decoctions. This blend is specifically designed to invigorate the spleen, soothe the liver, and alleviate the stagnation of turbid yin. Methods: This study develops a randomized, double-blind, positive drug-controlled trial protocol to investigate the effects of M-LGYCD on apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1)/lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity in reverse cholesterol transport. It is planned to recruit 124 outpatient and inpatient obese MAFLD patients with syndrome of spleen deficiency and liver depression, along with turbid yin stagnation for a period of 8 weeks. The research goal is to assess the efficiency and safety of M-LGYCD by analyzing liver and kidney functions, blood lipids, metabolic indicators, and patient-reported symptoms before and after treatment. Additionally, plasma ApoA1/LCAT activity measurement, transcriptome analysis, and lipid metabolome analysis will be conducted to elucidate the therapeutic mechanism of M-LGYCD and reveal the connotation of spleen deficiency and liver depression, along with turbid yin stagnation syndrome. Discussion: This study is expected to provide a scientific basis and new therapeutic ideas for the TCM treatment of obese MAFLD.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose of review The dynamic reconstruction of oropharyngeal defects demands tailored solutions that balance functional, aesthetic, and oncologic priorities. This review synthesizes advancements in reconstructive techniques over the last 18 months, contextualized within the evolving landscape of oropharyngeal disease, and highlights innovations that prioritize both surgical efficacy and quality of life. Recent findings Recent studies underscore the importance of tailored, functionally focused reconstructive strategies, integrating robotic-assisted surgery and tunneled, folded, or super-thin flaps. Buccinator myomucosal and lateral arm flaps have garnered attention for their versatility and low morbidity, while platelet-rich fibrin and tissue plug modifications have shown promise in reducing common reconstructive complications such as pharyngocutaneous fistulas. Other studies have addressed the impact of prior or upcoming radiation on reconstructive approach. Many emphasize quality of life and aesthetic measures, representing a shift toward survivorship over solely objective outcomes. Summary Modern oropharyngeal reconstruction emphasizes patient-specific and function-preserving strategies that necessitate biologic adjuncts and nuanced surgical planning. However, the lack of prospective studies, standardized outcome measures, and comparator groups underscores the need for future research to ensure broader applicability and improved reliability of these approaches.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To evaluate rates of critical illness and significant infection among children discharged from the emergency department (ED) with a pending blood culture. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of children 90 days to 18 years old discharged from one of 37 pediatric EDs between 2016 and 2024 with a complete blood count or C-reactive protein performed. Our primary outcome was a diagnosis of specific bacteremia on representation to the ED within 3 days. Secondary outcomes on 3-day return visit included: (1) sepsis, (2) intensive care unit admission, and (3) receipt of ≥3 days of systemic antibiotics. We evaluated for differences in outcomes based on the performance of a blood culture on the index visit. Results: We included 416,357 discharges (median encounter age 6.3 y, IQR: 2.1 to 12.7). Of these, 229,269 (55.1%) had a blood culture collected. Among encounters with a blood culture, 0.1% (n = 151; 95% CI: 0.1-0.1) had specific bacteremia on return visit. Encounters with a blood culture at the index visit had higher odds of specific bacteremia [odds ratio (OR) 10.86, 95% CI: 5.8-20.34], sepsis (OR: 3.16, 95% CI: 1.88-5.30), intensive care unit admission (OR: 2.82, 95% CI: 1.94-4.12), and ≥3 days of systemic antibiotics (OR: 4.77, 95% CI: 4.17-5.46). Conclusions: Children discharged with a pending blood culture have higher rates of significant bacteremia and other clinically important return visits than children discharged without a blood culture, though absolute rates of these outcomes were low. Improved guidelines are needed to better identify children who require blood cultures.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Tailgut cysts, or retrorectal cystic hamartomas, are uncommon developmental lesions found in the theoretical space between the rectum and the sacrum. Frequently asymptomatic and incidentally detected, they occur predominantly in women. Compression of nearby structures may cause perineal and back pain and even obstructed labor. Case Report: We report a case of a 50-year-old man with prior coccygeal fracture who presented with dull perineal pain, worsened by prolonged sitting. MRI revealed a cystic mass, and surgical excision was performed via a posterior perineal approach. Postoperative recovery was uneventful apart from surgery-related increased perineal pain. Pathology demonstrated a retrorectal cystic hamartoma. Discussion: Tailgut cysts are thought to originate from the embryonic tail, which normally regresses by the eighth week of gestation. MRI is the preferred imaging modality, with cysts appearing hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 images. Solid components or irregular cyst walls on imaging may suggest malignancy. Preoperative biopsy carries risks of hemorrhage, infection, and tract seeding. In purely cystic lesions, complete surgical resection without biopsy is preferred. A perineal approach is recommended for small lesions below S3, while abdominal and abdominoperineal approaches are needed for larger lesions and those superior to S3. Routine coccygectomy was previously thought necessary to prevent recurrence but is now understood to be avoidable unless needed for exposure or the cyst is adherent. Malignant transformation occurs in up to 27% of cases, with recurrence up to 16%. Complete excision is essential to prevent recurrence and obtain a definitive diagnosis. Conclusion: Tailgut cysts, the most common retrorectal tumors, are often asymptomatic. MRI is the preferred imaging modality. Complete surgical resection is crucial to prevent malignancy and recurrence. The role of preoperative biopsy is controversial, and routine coccygectomy is no longer recommended.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) remains a critical clinical challenge, with peptic ulcer disease accounting for up to two-thirds of cases. While most bleeding duodenal ulcers respond to endoscopic therapy, refractory hemorrhage, particularly in the presence of arterial involvement or vascular anomalies, may necessitate escalation to interventional radiology (IR) or surgery. Case presentation: We present the case of a 64-year-old woman with a bleeding duodenal ulcer arising from an aberrant branch of the superior mesenteric artery in the setting of severe celiac artery stenosis. Despite multiple endoscopic interventions and an attempted transcatheter arterial embolization, hemorrhage persisted due to challenging vascular anatomy and tortuous arterial supply. Ultimately, emergent laparotomy with oversewing of the bleeding vessel and duodenal repair achieved definitive hemostasis. The patient experienced a prolonged but successful recovery and was discharged to rehabilitation in stable condition. Discussion: This case highlights the importance of early recognition of vascular variants and altered mesenteric flow in patients with UGIB. It also reinforces the role of surgery as a critical salvage therapy when less invasive measures fail. Conclusion: This case demonstrates the need for early multidisciplinary coordination and timely escalation to IR or surgical management in high-risk duodenal ulcer bleeding, particularly when aberrant mesenteric anatomy complicates standard approaches.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction and importance: Transvenous embolization (TVE) for brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) typically requires two microcatheters or a dual-lumen mini-balloon catheter in the draining vein. A single Apollo microcatheter can replace these devices, offering a novel TVE alternative for AVMs with the “Caput Medusa” sign. This case report describes the technique, as such reports remain limited. Case presentation: A 34-year-old male patient suffered intracranial hemorrhage and developed right-sided hemiplegia and aphasia. Angiography revealed a left corpus callosum AVM supplied by the left anterior cerebral artery and lenticulostriate artery, with drainage into a thick vein exhibiting the “Caput Medusa” sign. After navigating the tortuous, stenotic distal draining vein using an Apollo microcatheter, TVE was performed through the following sequential steps: coiling of the left distal anterior cerebral artery, temporary occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, maintenance of blood pressure below 100 mm Hg, and injection of Onyx-18 via the Apollo microcatheter to achieve complete AVM obliteration. Postoperatively, no new neurological deficits were observed. On postoperative day 40 follow-up, he could walk with right muscle strength grade 4 and had normal speech function. Clinical discussion: The “Caput Medusa” sign of the AVM is produced by the convergence of multiple shunts into a thick proximal draining vein, making the draining vein system clearly visible. The Apollo microcatheter is soft and can navigate through the tortuous and stenotic drainage vein. Conclusion: The “Caput Medusa” sign of the AVM facilitates TVE visualization. TVE may be feasible in selected AVMs when a single Apollo microcatheter is used.",

    "Abstract": "Since the discovery of gadolinium (Gd) in the brain following the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), considerable progress has been made in understanding their pharmacokinetics and neurotoxicology. This review summarizes animal studies assessing the presence of Gd after GBCA administration, with a specific focus on functional and behavioral outcomes, rather than providing a comprehensive overview of all aspects of Gd presence in the brain. These findings indicate that Gd accumulation in the brain depends on the chemical structure of GBCAs, with linear agents exhibiting greater retention and slower clearance than macrocyclic agents. Gd distribution is nonhomogeneous, primarily localized in deep gray matter structures, and is influenced by cerebrospinal fluid-mediated transport and perivascular deposition. Although motor and cognitive functions are generally unaffected under normal conditions, prolonged exposure to linear GBCAs or preexisting conditions such as inflammation or metabolic disorders may increase neurotoxic risks, resulting in motor and cognitive deficits. Pain and sensory hypersensitivity are frequently and reproducibly observed, particularly when linear agents are used. We will also discuss the potential mechanisms of neurotoxicity caused by free Gd 3+ ion. However, these mechanistic findings are limited because the studies cannot be extrapolated to clinical practice. Future studies should investigate the potential associations between GBCA exposure and neurodegenerative diseases. These insights are essential for enhancing GBCA safety and informing clinical guidelines.",

    "Abstract": "Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH), also known as Masson tumor, is a rare benign vascular lesion characterized by reactive endothelial proliferation within the vessel lumen. Eyelid involvement is exceedingly uncommon and may clinically mimic malignant vascular tumors. The authors report a case of post-traumatic IPEH of the eyelid in a 50-year-old man presenting with a slowly enlarging purplish nodule in the lateral canthal region. Complete surgical excision was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed tuft-like papillary endothelial proliferation confined within an expanded vein with associated thrombus, without cytologic atypia or mitotic activity, consistent with the pure type of IPEH. Immunohistochemical staining showed diffuse CD34 positivity and negative p53 expression, supporting the diagnosis and excluding angiosarcoma. No recurrence was observed during follow-up. This case underscores the extreme rarity of eyelid involvement and emphasizes that, despite a history of trauma, accurate subtype classification of IPEH relies on histopathologic rather than clinical findings.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: 1) Analyze National Institutes of Health grant disbursement to female otolaryngologists, 2) compare funding patterns to those of ophthalmology and neurosurgery, and 3) provide strategies to increase female surgeon-scientists. Methods: The principal investigators of K, R, and U grants in each specialty were collected from the National Institutes of Health Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools Expenditures and Results for 2000-2021. To factor in the number of females versus males, the number of female or male grant holders was divided by the respective number of female or male physicians in each field for proportional analysis. Conversion rates of K to R or U grants were calculated. Results: Otolaryngology had a 1.46 times higher rate of female K grant holders (p=0.02), and a trend of 1.27 times higher rate of female R and U grant holders than male grant holders (p=0.13). Neurosurgery had 2.23 times greater rate of female K grant holders (p&lt;0.01), and 2.62 times greater rate of female R and U grant holders than otolaryngology (p&lt;0.01). Ophthalmology trended to have a 0.25 times higher rate of female K grant holders (p=0.24), but a 0.19 times lower rate of R and U grant holders than otolaryngology (p=0.12). Female otolaryngology grant holders tended to convert at a 24.4% lower rate than males (p=0.13). Conclusion: Female otolaryngology surgeon-scientists’ success in obtaining funding reflects successful prior initiatives and holds promise for increased female representation in leadership. However, there are fewer female otolaryngology grant holders compared to neurosurgery, illuminating the need for continued efforts.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Social contingencies—the timely responses that follow infant action—facilitate learning in the moment and over developmental time. Although links between social contingencies and infant learning are well documented, the mechanisms of influence remain underspecified. We draw on a growing body of research to propose several pathways that lead from infant action to social contingency to infant learning, with a focus on early word learning as a model system. Specifically, we contend that social contingency: (i) builds on infant attention, (ii) creates multisensory experiences, (iii) spurs a self-sustaining feedback loop that engenders continued engagement by the infant, (iv) facilitates connections among events in memory, and (v) supports infants’ learning of the pragmatics of human communication. We conclude with consideration of the role of social contingency beyond infancy, across domains, and across nested timescales.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Human infants express vocal distress to signal needs to be met by a caregiver. Maternal responses to infant distress are influenced by biological constraints and shaped by cultural practices. This study used a culture learning perspective to investigate the ways immigrant mothers’ responsiveness to their infants’ vocal distress is modified by acculturation. Methodologically, group-level acculturation was assessed by comparing immigrant Japanese, South Korean and South American dyads with nonmigrant dyads in their respective cultures of origin (Japan, South Korea and Argentina) and destination (United States); immigrant mothers were also compared with each other. Altogether, 408 mothers and their 5½-month-old infants were videorecorded in the naturalistic setting of the home. The frequencies and odds ratios for five maternal responses to infant distress (distract, hold, nurture, speak, affection) were computed using sequential analysis and then compared. Patterns of acculturation at the group level proved to be specific to each cultural group. Comparisons among the immigrant samples revealed differences for most responses. These results support the specificity principle in acculturation for maternal responsiveness to infant distress.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Previous studies on social contingency have revealed that young infants are sensitive to the consistent temporal pairing of contingent responses and can draw various, evolutionarily relevant inferences from it. For example, when infants identify that it is highly probable for an unfamiliar entity to produce temporally contingent responses to another agent’s actions, they can infer that the reactive entity is an intentional agent, even if it shows no other cues of agency. However, the consistent temporal pairing of contingently exchanged actions is not sufficient to account for the full range of inferences induced by contingent social reactivity. Based on recent findings, I argue that recognizing socially contingent interactions relies on the sensitivity to the predictability of subsequent actions along three dimensions. I propose that young infants monitor ‘what’, ‘when’ and ‘how’ response actions are produced. By tracking these three factors, infants can represent the relatedness of subsequent actions exhibited by interacting social partners, guiding their contingency-based inferences, including those that have traditionally been viewed as independent of social contingency. I conjecture that the cognitive mechanism to monitor the predictability of exchanged actions may have become further specialized during human evolution, enabling social partners to engage in complex cooperative and communicative interactions.

    "Abstract": "Abstract For human infants, attention is a crucial skill that both facilitates and constrains learning, with individual differences predicting cognitive development. Traditionally, early attention differences were posited to arise from predetermined non-social mechanisms. However, given human infants’ altriciality and extended dependence on carers, persistent attention differences may also be affected by early social feedback. Here, we experimentally tested social influences on early attention by manipulating the form and timing of social interactions, then assessing infant attention in a subsequent behavioural vigilance task. Eighty infants aged 6–7 months interacted with an experimenter who responded to infants’ looks and vocalizations using one of four response schedules, varying in contingency (rate of responding to infant behaviour) and joint focus (response congruency with infants’ attention). Infants then completed the vigilance task with a new adult. We found that experimenters’ prior contingency predicted infants’ later attention. When rarely responded to, infants subsequently showed higher vigilance (frequent visual scanning and shorter response latencies) than infants who received high response rates. Furthermore, highly vigilant infants attended more rigidly to highly salient stimuli across task trials. Our findings provide strong experimental evidence that contingent social feedback causally organizes infant attention in later settings, suggesting possible mechanisms for interventions supporting adaptive outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Children learn to communicate via real-time behavioural feedback loops with their social partners (e.g. infant vocalizes, caregiver responds and infant learns from the response). Across development, feedback loops become increasingly complex as children master new skills, engage in new activities, interact with a growing network of social partners, and thus elicit a tremendous variety of social responses. For autistic individuals, these feedback loops unfold in distinct ways. Autistic people’s social behaviours (like gaze, gestures and language) differ from the behaviours of non-autistic people; as a result, they elicit different input from social partners, which then has cascading impacts on future social behaviour. Here, we review literature on the mechanisms that underpin social communication development in autism from infancy through adulthood. We discuss how changes in abilities (e.g. motor, cognitive, emotion, communication), social demands and environmental contexts (e.g. interactions with peers) influence the social contingency experiences of autistic individuals. We propose that differences in real-time behavioural feedback loops contribute, in part, to broader developmental trends in autism (e.g. the pace of language learning). Research from neurodiverse samples offers insights into how feedback loops facilitate social communicative development broadly and has real-world implications for clinical and educational initiatives.

    "Abstract": "Abstract From birdsong to human language, acoustic communication by vocal learners involves the concatenation of sounds into sequences. Sequences are more efficient for the producer and more accommodating to the capacities of receivers. Over development, the compression of syllables into rapid sequences (in terms of more syllables per second) may reflect both social learning and motor maturation. We tested whether sequence compression could be predicted uniquely by exogenous (i.e. social) and endogenous (i.e. motor) sources. In human infants, we found that (i) vocal sequences strongly engage adults, (ii) from 5 to 10 months, sequences compress, (iii) social feedback to 5-month-olds’ sequences predicted sequence compression over development, and (iv) sequence compression over development predicted infants’ vocabulary development. We next examined the extent to which compression develops in a paradigm in which we could separate social feedback from motor practice. In zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata), we found that (i) motor development predicted sequence compression, but (ii) compression only predicted song maturity (similarity to tutor) when birds received contingent social feedback to their immature vocalizing. In addition, (iii) social feedback predicted finches’ sequence compression. These findings demonstrate the potency of social feedback across two vocal learning species in the emergence of vocal efficiency.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Social interactions are crucial for learning not only in humans but also in non-human animals. To date, comparative studies have typically focused on what is learned from others and on purely observational learning, while paying less attention on how social interactions facilitate learning. Here, we present how computational approaches can be leveraged to examine the role of contingency in learning through social interactions, focusing on callitrichid monkeys. They are the only primates besides humans in which group members other than the mother contribute significantly to infant care (i.e. cooperative breeding), resulting in more and richer opportunities for social interactions and learning, in both immatures and adults. We first review how contingency, turn-taking and social timing fundamentally shape learning and inter-individual coordination. We then zoom in on turn-taking in vigilance and vocal accommodation, illustrating how mathematical modelling can offer unique insights into the underlying mechanisms. We also highlight the potential of hybrid approaches that combine machine learning’s pattern detection strengths with the interpretability and explanatory power of mathematical models. Overall, we find that contingency is key to learning through social interactions not only in humans but also in non-human primates, and perhaps particularly so in the cooperatively breeding callitrichids.

    "Abstract": "Abstract During communicative interactions, individuals exert reciprocal influences on each other; senders influence receivers and receivers influence senders. Relatively little is known about how contingent interactions vary across social contexts (audiences), and such investigations could provide insight into the function of behavioural contingencies. Here, we analyse behavioural contingencies across two different social contexts in zebra finches. Specifically, because male zebra finches learn their vocalizations during social interactions in development and use these learnt vocalizations during courtship interactions in adulthood, we analysed behavioural contingencies between adult and juvenile males (learning) and between adult males and females (courtship). We discovered that adult male zebra finches (senders) can display ‘overt behaviours’ before song production that increase the attention of receivers and, moreover, that the contingent attentional responses of juvenile males but not of adult females predicted the type of song produced by the adult male. Specifically, adult males were more likely to direct songs at juveniles when juveniles became attentive after the overt behaviour, but they directed songs at females regardless of the female’s attentional state. Together, these data underscore that audiences differentially affect song production in songbirds and suggest that behavioural contingencies could be more important for learning than for reproduction.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Vocal individuality has important biological functions in mammals: at crucial stages of development, it ensures feeding and is a prerequisite for auditory-based mother–pup recognition. Is vocal individuality only shaped by maturation or also by the degree of conspecific acoustic input? Here, we test how the neonatal auditory environment shapes development and individualization of calls in harbour seal pups (Phoca vitulina). To simulate low- versus high-conspecific acoustic density, 18 pups heard playbacks of calls from either 2 or 30 conspecifics. We recorded calls before and after playback exposure and extracted 12 acoustic parameters. Supervised machine learning and discriminant function analyses showed greater individual distinctiveness in both groups after playback, indicating a developmental trend toward individualization. Notably, pups exposed to less-variable input showed higher individuality. Euclidean distances on call parameters showed that both groups diverged from the playback signals. Distances on within-pup and between-pups housed together revealed opposite trajectories in the two groups: after the exposure, less-variable auditory input determined steadier individual calls, while more-variable auditory input scattered calls across the acoustic space. Altogether, our findings indicate that auditory input modulates vocal development in pups, making harbour seals a promising model for unravelling how neonatal environment affects vocal plasticity in a non-human mammal.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Understanding social relationships is critical to succeeding in primate societies. In species with complex social networks (including humans), correctly predicting the strength of one’s social relationships or bonds helps individuals better navigate future interactions. Social contingency—behaviour that depends on and directly responds to another’s actions—is a key feature of interaction that provides opportunities to learn about these relationships. We propose that playful teasing in great apes represents a specialized form of social contingency that enables relationship assessment in a relatively safe context. Playful teasing involves one individual pestering, harassing or provoking another in a playful manner. An ape can learn about their bond by observing how a social partner responds to mild provocation—seeing how far they can push the other before receiving an explicitly negative response. Since responses range from mild aversion to benign tolerance to reciprocal play, the teaser can gain valuable information about relationship quality through monitoring the socially contingent responses to teasing actions. This form of learning through contingency may have evolved as a relatively low-risk method to assess social relationships through direct feedback, though several alternative explanations exist. We examine multiple evolutionary hypotheses for playful teasing and offer suggestions for future empirical testing.

    "Abstract": "Abstract A limitation of social contingency research with infants is that scientists can only instruct the caregivers to modulate their interactive behaviour with the infant. This approach results in a one-sided perspective on social contingency where the infant is a passive recipient merely reacting to changing circumstances. Thus, with this approach it is not possible to investigate how infants actively shape social contingency. We propose the use of a novel realistic interactive digital model of a human child (named by its developers as ‘BabyX’) as an innovative social contingency research tool. This simulated digital child is autonomously animated by a cognitive architecture that can interact in real time with a social partner in human-like ways. Critically, researchers can manipulate the digital child’s responsiveness to social contingency. In this article, we present three examples to illustrate the limits of current methodological approaches in social contingency research. Second, we introduce the digital child and highlight its usability to investigate social contingency. Third, we argue that studies with the digital child are key to closing the loop in social contingency research. It is our opinion that infants’ communicative signals are key to shaping caregiver responsiveness. By employing BabyX we are in the unique position of being able to investigate not only how caregivers respond to infants’ social contingency, but how infants actively shape social interactions.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Many debates in the language acquisition literature have revolved around the role of negative evidence for the acquisition of grammar. The scientific study of this question has not been settled with traditional research methods, given that it requires handling children’s natural social interaction while controlling for the specific role of error-contingent feedback, independent of other types of input. Here, we leveraged computational modelling to test whether there are learning gains in grammar induced by caregivers’ feedback above and beyond learning from input alone. More specifically, we compared language models trained on large corpora of child-directed language to the same models that were additionally fine-tuned through reinforcement learning using a reward model trained to provide caregiver-like feedback. Focusing on clarification requests, we found that fine-tuned models produced more grammatical utterances than baseline models. However, performance on challenging benchmarks of grammar knowledge evaluation did not improve. We showed that these benchmarks could, in principle, be improved through integration of other types of feedback. The broad impact of the current work is to introduce a methodological framework that enables scientists to test many types of feedback, including signals beyond the verbal modality, leading to a more comprehensive evaluation of caregiver feedback in language development.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Dialogical actions are contingent in humans and also need to be contingent when implemented on intelligent systems such as social robots in order to ease human–robot interaction. Whereas current studies suggest that social robots can support children in different contexts, little is known about individual differences in the way children react to their instructions within an interaction. One dimension of individual differences is temperamental shyness—a tendency to be reluctant in novel social situations. The literature suggests that shyness might influence contingency patterns, and effective robots would need to adapt to this. This study aims to analyse the patterns of dialogical actions in preschoolers (N = 28) in a long-term interaction as a function of their shyness level. In two consecutive sessions in which a robot taught the children novel words, we investigated latencies between the robot’s prompt and the child’s corresponding action. Results showed that higher levels of shyness were associated with increased action latencies, particularly in the first session. However, this effect diminished over time, because latencies decreased from the first to the second session. The discussion focuses on the findings on the role of shyness in interactions with increasing familiarity, and their implications for a robot’s partner modelling.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Children’s social interactions with caregivers play a crucial role in their development. One strong cue to an ongoing social interaction is the mutual dependency of interaction partners’ behaviours, a feature we refer to as social contingency. Socially contingent interactions have been shown to support learning, but it remains underexplored whether social contingency alone, even in the absence of other social cues, can drive developmental advantages. Addressing this question requires faithfully representing bi-directional contingency in infant–adult interactions while isolating it from other social cues. Building on the perceptual crossing paradigm, we designed an innovative setup where infants and adults interact in real time using eye gaze, with all interactions mediated through a non-social, screen-based display. Extending beyond the one-way responsiveness in previous studies, this setup captures bi-directional contingency through dependencies in gaze movement upon mutual detection. Our findings demonstrate that social contingency modifies infant behaviour even in such a streamlined context. To extend the paradigm’s applicability, we integrated it with word learning, a task sensitive to the concurrent effect of social interaction. Preliminary evidence suggests that contingency facilitates word learning, underscoring the potential of the gaze-crossing paradigm to further elucidate the role of contingency in child development. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Mechanisms of learning from social interaction’.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract One of the primary aims of cognitive and behavioural sciences is to generate empirical findings that are both reproducible and generalizable to real-world settings. The present study investigates the extent to which results obtained from a structured laboratory task—parent–infant toy play—can be generalized to more naturalistic contexts and everyday activities. We focused on joint attention between parents and infants, a construct that has been extensively examined within developmental science. To characterize parent–infant joint attention during toy play, we recorded and analysed contingent gaze behaviour captured through dual head-mounted eye-tracking devices worn simultaneously by parents and their infants during spontaneous activities such as toy play and meal preparation. By continuously monitoring gaze locations and manual actions, we obtained fine-grained measures of how often dyads fixated on the same object concurrently and how their coordinated visual and manual behaviours contributed to the establishment and maintenance of joint attention. Our results suggest that laboratory findings can be both replicated and generalized when: (i) the study is designed to capture natural behaviours rather than to elicit specific, constrained responses, and (ii) the theoretical constructs are clearly defined and precisely measured through high-resolution behavioural data.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Primates exhibit a range of vocal behaviours. This range arises from species-specific developmental processes which, in turn, are shaped by evolutionary pressures. We must therefore consider that all primate species do not follow the same developmental path to their vocal behaviours. We will use marmoset monkeys as a case study for the integrative biology of vocal learning. As we will show, marmoset contact call development exhibits a pattern of socially guided vocal production learning that is like the pattern exhibited by prelinguistic human infants and the juvenile zebra finch, a songbird. This socially guided contact call development and other vocal behaviours emerge in a landscape of anatomical changes that is modulated by a large-scale neural system. Comparing their vocal developmental strategies with humans, we will then consider the possibility that the marmoset monkey's potential for infant vocal production learning may be the result of similar (convergent) evolutionary changes to their developmental timing and life history strategy. Overall, we hope that the example of marmoset monkeys presented here reveals how species differences in vocal behaviours—vocal learning, in this instance—can unfold across the different timescales of evolution, development and behaviour.

    "Abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is often associated with chronic liver diseases and significant alterations in host cellular signalling. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying HCV-related liver pathogenesis remain to be elucidated. The Hippo signalling pathway, a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival, plays a critical role in maintaining liver homeostasis. Here, we investigated the role of the Hippo pathway in HCV-related pathogenesis. We demonstrated that HCV infection induces degradation of LATS1, a key regulator of the Hippo pathway. Degradation of LATS1 protein was restored by a proteasomal inhibitor, but not a lysosome inhibitor, indicating that HCV promotes proteasomal degradation of LATS1 protein. HCV-induced degradation of LATS1 protein was suppressed in si-Itch-transfected Huh-7.5 cells. These results suggest that Itch ubiquitin ligase is involved in ubiquitin-dependent degradation of LATS1 protein. Cell fractionation assays and immunofluorescence staining revealed that HCV infection promoted nuclear translocation of YAP1 protein, suggesting that HCV infection suppresses the Hippo pathway. Furthermore, the transcription of YAP1 target genes, CYR61 and CTGF, that are involved in tissue remodelling and proliferation, was upregulated in HCV-infected Huh-7.5 cells and in HCV-infected patients. Taken together, we propose that HCV promotes the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of LATS1 protein, leading to suppression of the Hippo pathway, thereby upregulating transcription of CYR61 and CTGF genes, which may contribute to HCV-related pathogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "The emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria poses a major and growing public health risk. Because antibiotics act on specific molecular targets, bacteria may evolve resistance mechanisms that alter or bypass these targets. This work investigated the antimicrobial effects of carbon monoxide-releasing molecules (CORMs) and their potential for co-administration with a variety of commonly used antibiotics against Escherichia coli . CORMs, commonly transition metal carbonyls, release carbon monoxide under certain conditions. Interestingly, CORMs have been shown to exert antimicrobial activity against bacteria both in vitro and in vivo . However, to effectively treat patients with antibiotic-resistant infections, combination therapies involving two or more antimicrobial agents may be a useful approach. Herein, we report the antimicrobial activity of CORM-2 and CORM-3 against E. coli and, importantly, that sub-inhibitory concentrations of either compound in combination with antibiotics showed a significant increase in efficacy of the conventional antibiotics as assessed by inhibition of bacterial growth and reduced viability. Furthermore, administration of sub-inhibitory concentrations of CORMs increased the antimicrobial activity of multiple antibiotics with a range of modes of action when measured by E-tests and microdilution broth assays. The minimal bactericidal concentrations were reduced 2- to 8-fold and 10- to 63-fold for CORM-2 and CORM-3, respectively. Drug interactions between CORMs and antibiotics were also assessed using checkerboard microdilution methods, providing evidence that CORM activity is synergistic with a wide range of conventional antibiotics tested with fractional inhibitory concentration indices between 0.31 and 0.45. These findings demonstrate the antibacterial activity of CORMs and their synergy with a range of commonly used antibiotics, opening potential avenues for CORMs to be used as adjuvants to traditional antibiotic treatments.",

Design/methodology/approach Hydrogen diffusion, hydrogen adsorption and density functional theories were used to investigate the effects of tensile stress on the ingress behaviour of hydrogen. Findings Tensile stress/strain facilitated atomic bond relaxation and dislocation multiplication, resulting in a negative shift in the corrosion potential. Simultaneously, stress–defect interactions and dislocation multiplication induced by tensile stress/strain resulted in a decreased effective hydrogen diffusion coefficient. More importantly, tensile stress significantly enhanced surface hydrogen adsorption by increasing surface energy and introducing dislocation-induced adsorption sites. Furthermore, stress–defect interactions and dislocation multiplication suppressed hydrogen desorption and hindered subsurface hydrogen escape. In addition, strain reduced the hydrogen barrier energy, and dislocation multiplication provided fast diffusion channels, synergistically accelerating the hydrogen penetration into subsurface. These mechanisms collectively increased the surface coverage and hydrogen content. Originality/value The effects of tensile stress/strain on hydrogen permeation and adsorption behaviours were systematically analyzed.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to explore the impact of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance on enterprise competitiveness and integrates internal and external perspectives to analyze how supply chain stability and competitive strategy serve as mediating and moderating mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach Utilizing survey data from 2,973 companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, which encompass 23,360 observations from 2012 to 2022, this study constructs a unified analytical framework that incorporates supply chain stability and competitive strategy. Employing a dual fixed-effects model, the research empirically examines the direct effects of ESG performance on enterprise competitiveness, the mediating role of supply chain stability, and the moderating influence of competitive strategy among listed companies in China. Findings The study found that the enhancement of ESG performance significantly strengthens the competitiveness of enterprises. Furthermore, when enterprises improve their ESG performance, they can indirectly enhance their market competitiveness by increasing the stability of relationships with suppliers and customers, thereby improving the efficiency and responsiveness of the entire supply chain. In addition, by adopting different competitive strategies (cost leadership or differentiation) based on their resources and market positioning, enterprises can further amplify the positive impact of ESG performance on competitiveness. This paper also validates the main findings through two typical case studies.

It clarifies how divergent understandings of fairness contribute to polarized reactions to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts and positions fairness as a shared foundation for bridging divides. Design/methodology/approach A systematic review of 300 peer-reviewed articles from the Web of Science database was conducted. Articles were thematically analyzed to identify divergences and convergences in OJ and D&amp;I conceptualizations of fairness, culminating in an integrative theoretical framework grounded in OJ models. Findings Fairness perceptions underpin polarized responses to DEI. Integrating OJ's focus on individual-level cognitive-affective processes with D&amp;I's emphasis on intergroup dynamics and organizational contexts identifies three values that are central to fairness: individuality, group membership and morality. DEI backlash can be understood as perceived violations of meritocracy, procedural transparency, and moral clarity. Research limitations/implications The study is limited to published literature and theoretical exploration. Future research should examine how individuality, group membership, and morality interact to shape fairness perceptions across contexts. Practical implications The integrative fairness framework offers a basis for repairing relationships and advancing DEI with rigor. Restorative justice can help restore trust, while OJ measures offer a rigorous way to assess DEI programs' quality, implementation and impact across all groups.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This article explores the interconnection between childhood bullying victimisation and mental health and its resulting risk of subsequent drug addiction on a comparative international scale. Toward this, the objective of this article is to bring out the awareness about the abiding impacts of childhood bullying and how it leads to substance abuse and mental health problems in both developed and low- and middle-income nations. Design/methodology/approach The study uses a narrative literature review, where various literature reviews are used as a study selection. The literature review has led to the unfolding of seven themes that depict psychological impacts, causal factors and dilemmas of victimisation by bullies on the mental health of youth. Findings The link between childhood bullying with the mental health of youths who engage in substance abuse has been depicted to be strong. It also shows that victims of childhood bullying are at high risk of developing anxiety, depression and other mental issues. Further, a strong association also exists between drug addiction behaviour and bullied victims among the youth. Findings also indicate that bullying rates and substance use characteristics differ across the world, with developed nations reporting higher cyberbullying rates, whereas developing nations report higher victimisation rates, whether physical or social, resulting in drug addiction. Practical implications This narrative review can be an eye-opener for the schools, communities, organisations and policymakers to establish comprehensive anti-bullying programs and mental health support programs with an aim of eliminating bullying and providing help to the victims of bullying. The article encourages the context-specific interventions, especially regarding low- and middle-income nations in which the level of mental health support and policy implementation is still insufficient based on global policy lessons. Originality/value This narrative literature review will complement the existing research on childhood victimisation by bullying, mental health consequences and its predisposition to drug addiction. It adds an international comparative perspective, establishing cross-cultural similarities and differences, like bullying and its psychological impact. In addition, it provides the necessity of context-specific solutions to focus on these issues.",

While it is well established that general IT outsourcing is due to human resource scarcity, this relationship has not been explicitly theorized or empirically tested for information security. This oversight is notable given the specialized nature of security functions, which require distinct expertise and carry unique risks. These risks are especially salient for information-intensive firms. The purpose of this study is to theorize and perform an empirical analysis of how human resource scarcity and information intensity of firms affect their security outsourcing decision. Design/methodology/approach Analysis of firm-level data spanning nine years. Findings Firms facing IT human resource scarcity are more likely to outsource information security, whereas information-intensive firms are significantly less likely to do so. The interaction effect was not significant. Originality/value The finding contrasts with general IT outsourcing, where information-intensive firms are more likely to outsource non-security IT functions. The theory and empirical findings highlight the need for firms to carefully negotiate the balancing act between managing risks and benefiting from security outsourcing.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The electricity distribution industry is among the most hazardous sectors globally, with Iran experiencing a particularly high rate of severe accidents. While safety performance is traditionally measured using reactive, lagging indicators (e.g. accident rates), modern safety science advocates the use of proactive, leading indicators to predict and prevent incidents. However, a validated model integrating both indicator types is lacking for the Iranian context. This study aims to develop and empirically validate an integrated safety performance evaluation model that links leading and lagging indicators to provide an actionable tool for the electricity distribution industry. Design/methodology/approach This applied, cross-sectional study was conducted within an Iranian power distribution company. A comprehensive framework was constructed, categorizing 14 leading safety criteria into organizational, technical and human dimensions. Data on these leading indicators were collected from 158 safety personnel across 27 subsidiaries using a binary-scored questionnaire. The relative weight of each dimension and criterion was determined using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). An overall safety performance score (SPS) for each subsidiary and the mother company was calculated by integrating the leading indicator scores with their FAHP weights. Concurrently, standard lagging indicators – accident frequency rate (AFR), accident severity rate (ASR) and frequency-severity indicator (FSI) – were calculated from 1 year of archival data. Model validation was performed using Spearman’s correlation and linear regression analysis in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) to examine the relationship between the SPS (leading index) and the lagging indicators. Findings The overall company SPS was 0.67 out of 1.00. The organizational dimension was identified as the most critical (weight = 0.431), while the technical dimension was the weakest performer. Statistical analysis confirmed a significant negative correlation between the SPS and both AFR and ASR. Linear regression demonstrated that a one-unit increase in the SPS predicts a 55.0% decrease in AFR and a 54.6% decrease in FSI, thereby validating the predictive power of the proposed model. Research limitations/implications This study, like any other study, has faced limitations, including the fact that in this study, safety criteria were examined in three dimensions: organizational, technical and human. Other dimensions of safety, including environmental and behavioral dimensions, which have also been mentioned in the research background, can be considered, and appropriate criteria can be presented. Binary logic was used to score the indicators in this study, and in future research, the radar logic of the organizational excellence model can be used to measure the status of the indicators. This method helps to calculate the performance score for the company and also to define corrective actions to improve the safety performance status. One of the limitations of the research is that the study was conducted in one of the Iranian electricity distribution companies (Khorasan Razavi Province Electricity Distribution Company), and naturally, cultural characteristics can affect its results, thus limiting the possibility of generalizing its results to other countries. Practical implications The research findings can be used to develop safety policies for the power industry across three dimensions: organizational, technical and human. Based on the criteria and indicators of each of the mentioned dimensions, operational plans can be developed considering the score of each indicator. This is not a universal proposition, but it should be done based on the differing situations such as company and country. Social implications This study provides an empirically validated model that effectively links proactive safety management with reactive outcomes in a high-risk industry. The findings demonstrate that strategic improvement in leading indicators – particularly by addressing identified weaknesses in the technical dimension – can significantly reduce accident rates. The model offers managers a practical and diagnostic dashboard for transitioning from a reactive to a proactive, data-driven safety management strategy, with potential applicability in other high-risk sectors in similar cultural contexts. Originality/value This study offers a theoretical base for preventing workplace accidents and improving safety of power distribution companies in Iranian culture as a unique culture.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Beyond the traditional concerns of cost, time and quality, megaprojects often face criticism for failing to meet social responsibility expectations, which are essential for ensuring their long-term sustainability and legitimacy. Governance mechanisms, particularly contractual and relational mechanisms, offer potential pathways to improve megaproject social responsibility performance (MSRP). However, their effectiveness can vary depending on the host country's institutional environment, particularly in the context of international megaprojects. Therefore, this study examines the impact of governance mechanisms on MSRP and the role of the host country's institutional environment in moderating these effects with a specific focus on Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) megaprojects. Design/methodology/approach A conceptual model comprising six hypotheses was developed. A questionnaire survey was designed, refined and distributed to the participants in the BRI megaprojects, yielding 145 valid responses. The resulting data were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings The results indicate that both contractual governance and relational governance positively improve MSRP. While the host country's institutional environment does not directly impact MSRP, it plays a significant moderating role. Specifically, a weak institutional environment positively moderates the impact of contractual governance on MSRP, but it weakens the positive relationship between relational governance and MSRP. These results highlight the importance of adapting governance mechanisms based on the institutional context of the host country. Practical implications The findings suggest that policymakers and stakeholders should adopt context-specific governance frameworks that balance contractual and relational mechanisms while considering factors such as legal systems, political stability and economic development in the host country. Such tailored approaches enhance social responsibility performance in BRI megaprojects. Originality/value The study is one of the pioneering efforts to examine how different governance mechanisms enhance social responsibility performance in BRI megaprojects, with the host country's institutional environment playing a key role in shaping and determining the efficacy of these mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to examine the impact of innovative work behaviour (IWB) on sustainable innovation in micro-enterprises. While IWB is recognised as a driver of innovation in larger firms, its role in small-scale businesses remains unclear. This research investigates whether IWB fosters social and ecological innovations in micro-enterprises. Design/methodology/approach The study is based on survey data from 1,848 Polish micro-enterprises. A multivariate probit model (MVP) is used to assess the relationship between different dimensions of IWB (idea generation, exploration, championing and implementation) and sustainable innovations, measured according to the OSLO Manual and European Commission frameworks. Findings The results show that only idea exploration (seeking improvements beyond routine tasks) and idea implementation (efforts to develop new solutions) have a significant influence on sustainable innovation. Other IWB dimensions, such as idea generation and championing, have no significant effect. This suggests that proactive problem-solving and applied innovation are key to advancing sustainability in micro-enterprises. Practical implications Micro-enterprises should prioritise fostering employee behaviours related to exploring and implementing innovative solutions. Policymakers and business leaders should focus on training programs that enhance these capabilities to support ecological and social innovation. Originality/value This study provides empirical evidence on how IWB influences sustainability in micro-enterprises, an under-researched sector. By identifying the most impactful dimensions of IWB, it offers valuable insights for both academia and practice.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This article investigates the business case for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) within the context of Operations and Supply Chain Management (OSCM), a topic that has been the focus of intense debate in academic and practitioner circles, and has become strongly associated with conflicting ideological perspectives. It combines an extensive literature review on DEI and potential outcomes, including the other contributions in the special issue “On Sustainable Operations and Supply Chain Management: What about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion?”, with empirical analyses, both quantitative and qualitative, to examine the potential outcomes of DEI initiatives. Design/methodology/approach In the empirical analysis, a mixed-methods of explanatory sequential design is used. First, the association between OSCM employees' perceptions of workplace DEI and firm-level performance is examined using matched data from Glassdoor employee-reviews of DEI in Fortune 500 companies and Refinitiv Workspace. Then, a qualitative follow-up analysis is undertaken based on 10 interviews with experienced DEI-leaders and OSCM practitioners. Findings DEI research in OSCM is still in its early stages and extant knowledge is predominantly based on case studies. Evidence on the relationship between firm-level DEI and performance is mixed and may reflect the context as well as the available information. While there are arguments for a positive association, our quantitative analysis challenges this expectation. Our interviews highlight potential positive outcomes such as enhanced employee engagement and job satisfaction that could translate into performance, but also suggest negative effects when DEI initiatives alienate core groups, are performative rather than substantive, or incur significant short-term costs. Overall, further academic research is needed to address the rhetorics and realities of DEI, understand unfulfilled expectations, identify moderating and mediating factors, and thus potentially resolve inconsistencies in findings. Originality/value This introductory article underscores that the DEI debate is far from settled and offers a future research agenda based on an assessment of the current state of DEI scholarship within OSCM, empirical analyses and a review of the seven papers selected for this special issue.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The actual operation of face gear pairs in torque-split transmissions is prone to edge contact and nonuniform tooth surface loading. These issues, stemming from machining errors, installation inaccuracies and structural deformation under load, result in inconsistent contact patterns. Consequently, tooth surface modification is an essential measure for improving the service performance of face gears. Design/methodology/approach Based on the theory of face gear pair modification, a differential corrective design is proposed for the gear pairs in a torque-split transmission system. The design optimization targets the dual objectives of expanding tooth surface contact area and reducing transmission error fluctuations. Subsequently, a comprehensive optimization framework is developed based on numerical tooth contact analysis and loaded tooth contact analysis models to achieve the differential modification across the transmission branches. Findings The optimal modification parameters are derived through computation with the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II genetic algorithm. A finite element simulation model of the optimized system is subsequently constructed to assess the enhancements in gear meshing performance. Experimental validation demonstrates that the optimized parameters effectively improve the contact path, contact pattern, tooth surface stress distribution and transmission error characteristics. Originality/value This paper presents a modification scheme for face gear torque-split transmission systems, validated to meet practical requirements. The findings serve as a theoretical foundation for future surface modification of aviation face gear pairs.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to examine the impact of corporate governance (CG) on corporate risk-taking by considering the moderating effect of firm size and free cash flow. Design/methodology/approach The present study is based on a sample of 261 Indian firms spanning the period from 2014 to 2023. Suitable panel data models have been used for the analysis. Additionally, the system generalised method of moments model is used to address potential endogeneity issues and provide robust results. Findings The results disclose that robust CG practices lead to a reduction in corporate risk-taking, with firm size and free cash flow playing a significant moderating role in this relationship. The negative impact of CG on corporate risk-taking weakens for larger firms, underscoring the importance of size in shaping the dynamics between CG and corporate risk-taking. Additionally, findings show that the risk-reducing impact of CG strengthens as free cash flow increases, suggesting that governance amplifies risk control when cash is abundant. Originality/value The paper validates the significance of strong CG on risk-taking behaviour. While prior literature has established the roles of firm size and free cash flow in investment decisions, to the best of the knowledge, limited prior research has explicitly examined their moderating effects on the relationship between CG and corporate risk-taking. This study fills this gap by demonstrating how these critical firm-specific factors alter the efficacy of governance mechanisms, particularly within the unique institutional context of India.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to investigate whether short-term financial spillovers exist within a green supply chain by analyzing the dynamic stock price linkage between Tesla Inc. and its Taiwanese upstream supplier, Innolux Corporation. The research examines how Tesla’s daily price movements, particularly sustainability-related negative shocks, affect the supplier’s short-term stock performance. Design/methodology/approach This study uses daily stock price data for Tesla and Innolux from 2014 to 2024. A long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning model is used to forecast short-term price patterns, while a decision tree model identifies nonlinear threshold responses that characterize spillover transmission within a green supply chain. A regression model is further applied to statistically validate the cross-firm linkage and quantify the magnitude of Tesla’s influence on its supplier. Findings The results demonstrate that Tesla’s prior-day price movements have a significant predictive effect on Innolux’s next-day closing price. The LSTM model shows strong forecasting accuracy (RMSE = 0.4760; R² = 0.9121), while the decision tree identifies a critical threshold indicating that when Tesla’s daily decline exceeds 1.4%, Innolux is highly likely to experience a price drop. The regression analysis further confirms a strong linear relationship between the two firms’ stock price dynamics (R² = 0.992). Together, these findings provide robust evidence of short-term financial spillovers from a leading EV manufacturer to its upstream supplier within a green supply chain ecosystem. Research limitations/implications This study analyzes only a single upstream supplier in Tesla’s green supply chain, which may constrain the generalizability of its findings. In addition, external influences – such as macroeconomic fluctuations, policy shocks and geopolitical events – were not incorporated into the models. Future research may broaden the scope to include multiple firms across different tiers of the supply chain, integrate sustainability-related news or sentiment data, and apply nonlinear or regime-switching models to capture more complex spillover dynamics. Practical implications This study offers investors and portfolio managers actionable insights into short-term financial spillovers within green supply chains. The identified predictive linkage between Tesla and its upstream supplier, Innolux, provides a basis for timely risk assessment and threshold-based trading strategies, particularly during periods of sustainability-related negative shocks. The findings also support policymakers by underscoring the importance of improving data transparency, refining ESG disclosure mechanisms and promoting digital finance tools that enhance the resilience of sustainable industrial ecosystems. Social implications This study highlights the societal importance of transparency and resilience in sustainable supply chains. By revealing the financial interdependence between a leading global EV manufacturer and a Taiwanese upstream supplier, the findings emphasize the role of cross-border collaboration in advancing sustainability objectives. Enhanced data openness and the use of AI-based analytical tools can empower investors, firms, and policymakers to make informed decisions that support environmental responsibility and positive social impact. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is among the first to examine short-term financial spillovers within a green supply chain using deep learning techniques. By focusing on Tesla and its Taiwanese upstream supplier, Innolux, it presents a novel case-based analytical framework that integrates LSTM forecasting, decision tree threshold identification and regression validation. The research contributes to the green finance and sustainable supply chain literature by uncovering previously unobserved, short-horizon spillover mechanisms between leading EV firms and their suppliers within a sustainability-oriented industrial ecosystem.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to examine the long-term impact of digital financial inclusion (DFII) on humanitarian crises (HC) in Africa. Specifically, it seeks to explore how DFII, as both a technological and financial innovation, can be used to strengthen long-term crisis management, empower beneficiaries and support sustainable humanitarian efforts across African countries. Additionally, the research investigates how DFII can help reduce mortality rates, improve access to clean water and decrease refugee populations. Design/methodology/approach This study explores long-term DFII influence on HC in Africa nations from 2004 to 2023, using dynamic common correlated estimation (DCCE) method, and Dumitrescu and Hurlin (2012) Granger causality test. Findings The DCCE results portray a long-term diminishing influence of DFII on HC. Specifically, greater DFII reduces HC including mortality rates and refugee populations, while improving clean water access, over the long-term. Additionally, less insecurity (IS) reduces HC over the long-term. Other significant drivers of HC are political instability (PS) and domestic credit to private sector (DCPS). The causality test’s results portray a bi-directional causality between DFII and HC, with one-way causality from IS, PS, PR and DCPS to HC. Research limitations/implications The research unravels the significant role of DFII in alleviating humanitarian crises in African nations over the long-term. Additionally, it portrays that improvements in DFII helps in reducing mortality rates and refugee populations, including increasing access to clean water. Practical implications To manage and alleviate HC, Africa’s policymakers are advised to adopt strategies that promote DFII, invest in digital infrastructure and integrate these systems into disaster management frameworks to enhance the effectiveness of humanitarian responses. Originality/value This study presents a novel multi-country analysis of DFII and HC relationship across ten under-researched African nations.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to address the theoretical and methodological gaps in the green logistics and supply chain management (GLSCM) literature through the lens of knowledge management. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review of 80 articles was conducted following a strict research protocol and the theories-contexts-methods framework, refined through explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Findings Results show that the resource-based view, the natural-resource-based view and institutional theory are the most frequently applied theories in GLSCM research. The literature is dominated by single-country studies, with limited attention to multi-country contexts. A similar pattern is observed at the industry level, where only a few studies cover multiple industries. Building on these findings, this study develops a framework that extends current theoretical approaches and emphasizes the need to incorporate global, national and organizational-level knowledge-sharing and innovation practices to prepare for and respond to disruptions like the global pandemic. Research limitations/implications Although justified in the existing literature, the research protocol applied may exclude relevant studies. Similarly, the coding procedure, while guided by strict rules, may unintentionally introduce bias. Practical implications When facing multiple combined external pressures on the supply chain network, firms can mitigate adverse effects by creating knowledge, engaging knowledge brokers and establishing a digital platform and governance mechanism for effective knowledge transfer. The study also highlights a growing trend in stakeholder activism. Stricter regulations and transparent incentives tied to sustainable practices throughout the supply chain could encourage more sustainable behaviors among all stakeholders.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This article seeks to understand how marginal organizational actors can successfully challenge and overcome “deep structures” that inhibit change in bureaucratic, ossified organizations. Design/methodology/approach The research utilizes a longitudinal, comparative, qualitative analysis based on semi-structured interviews with 47 workers and 11 union officials across three voting cycles. Findings Early attempts at change, based on parrhesia, were unable to dismantle the deep structures maintaining organizational stasis, leading to repeated failures. It was only when marginal actors engaged in organizational dissensus that the underlying structures were successfully challenged, leading to transformative change. This dissensual approach, which contests the very logic of a system’s hierarchy and rules of discourse, was the critical factor in converting prior failures into success. Originality/value This article builds on structuration theory to illustrate the importance of dissensus for transformative organizational change, while exposing the limitations of dialogical and parrhesiastic perspectives.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study examines the cross-cultural challenges experienced by expatriate doctors working within an National Health Service (NHS) Health Board in Wales, with particular attention to how they navigate adaptation in professional and social contexts. Design/methodology/approach The study adopts a qualitative research design based on semi-structured interviews with expatriate doctors employed at a Welsh NHS health board. Data were analysed thematically to explore participants' experiences of communication, relocation, workplace practices and organisational support during their adaptation process. Findings The findings indicate that expatriate doctors face persistent challenges related to language and communication nuances, relocation and social isolation, and adjustment to flatter professional hierarchies. Successful adaptation was facilitated by individual factors such as personality traits (notably extraversion and open-mindedness), access to social and familial networks, and prior exposure to the UK healthcare system. Participants consistently highlighted the absence of structured cross-cultural training as a barrier to smoother professional integration. Originality/value By focusing on self-initiated expatriate doctors in a Welsh healthcare context, the study extends existing research on cross-cultural adaptation in healthcare beyond commonly examined settings. It offers practical insights for improving onboarding, cross-cultural training and institutional support mechanisms, with implications for staff wellbeing, retention and patient care outcomes within the NHS.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to explore how open innovation practices in the healthcare sector can improve collaboration, while also fostering efficiency and quality of services. The analysis focuses on how open innovation can meet healthcare sector challenges and foster the development of innovative solutions through strategic approaches, process innovations and collaboration. Design/methodology/approach The study combines a systematic literature review, guided by the PRISMA flowchart, with an empirical analysis based on multiple case studies. While the literature review identified relevant studies on open innovation in healthcare, the empirical analysis examined concrete applications of these practices. Findings The results show a growing interest in open innovation, with the case study analysis identifying six categories, including innovations in processes, adoption of emerging technologies, strategic approaches, co-creation and intellectual capital management. In particular, open innovation practices facilitated collaboration between external and internal actors, leading to improved healthcare service quality and operational efficiency. Practical implications Top management, through strong leadership and by implementing open innovation practices, can facilitate collaboration between actors in the healthcare ecosystem, coordinating values, goals and missions, and promoting the co-creation of innovative solutions. These will result in benefits associated with improved decision-making, problem-solving, incentivised employee engagement and improved holistic performance. Originality/value This study offers an original contribution by adopting an ecosystem perspective and combining a systematic literature review with multiple case studies. It identifies six previously underexplored categories of innovation that reshape patient-centred care, therapeutic development and technology adoption, providing concrete managerial insights to enhance healthcare quality and efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study examines the validity of a core principle of adaptive leadership framework: that leadership is distinct from authority. It also extends the framework by offering new insights. Design/methodology/approach Latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to reveal hidden heterogeneity in leadership behaviors among a sample of 1909 organizational employees with different authority levels. We also used multinomial regression to explore how authority level relates to adaptive leadership behavior classes. Findings Our findings are consistent with Heifetz's (1994) notion of leadership is distinct from authority. Results suggest that organizations may have employees across different authority levels who exhibit leadership to varying degrees. This study also indicates that some groups of employees without substantial authority may exercise adaptive leadership even more than those in high positions of authority. It also offers a counterintuitive finding that shows as formal authority increases, the likelihood of belonging to higher-ALB profiles decreases. Practical implications Organizations should not restrict their leadership development strategy to only those with senior or minimal authority. The article explains why training leadership competencies should be tailored to specific authority levels. It introduces organizational conditions needed to see more leadership behavior from those in authority positions. It also offers insights into how individuals with more or less authority in organizations can support one another while exercising leadership. Originality/value This study advances adaptive leadership framework by providing empirical support for one of its core principles, namely that leadership can be exercised from any position, independent of authority.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to design and characterise new photoluminescent (PL) coatings intended for road marking applications, comprising a mixture of a transparent epoxy resin, phosphorescent pigments (SrAl2O4:Eu²+, Dy³+ and ZnS:Cu) and glass microspheres. The aim is to improve road marking durability, visibility and overall safety performance, particularly under low lighting and harsh environmental conditions. Design/methodology/approach Hybrid epoxy coatings were prepared with 5% and 10% pigment contents and sizes of Types 1 and 2 glass beads (sizing ranges of 100–850 µm and 600–2000 µm, respectively). The requisite standardised American Society of Testing and Materials and Deutsches Institut für Normung tests were also performed to evaluate the coatings based on adhesion, abrasion, slip, ultraviolet (UV) stability, water and oil resistance, luminance, dry film thickness and time to dry. Findings Compositions with 8 Wt.% Type 1 glass beads and 5–10 Wt.% SrAl2O4:Eu²+, Dy³+ pigment provided optimal luminosity and strength. The coatings were characterised by an adhesion strength of over 1.5 MPa, an abrasion loss of less than 40 mg after 1,000 cycles and a slip resistance of up to 56 British Pendulum Number (BPN). SrAl2O4:Eu²+, Dy³+ has an average luminosity retention of over 80% (&amp;gt; 400 mcd/m²) after 180 min, which is superior to that of ZnS: Cu-containing compositions. All formulations provided high light-fastness and UV resistance, with an average film thickness of 420–480 µm and an average drying time of 132–207 min. Originality/value The prepared microsphere-strengthened PL epoxy coatings exhibited superior durability and self-illuminative capabilities compared to common retro-reflective materials. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first time when SrAl2O4:Eu²+, Dy³+-based pigment-epoxy microsphere composites are tuned to exhibit optimal mechanical and optical properties simultaneously, which will prove to be more sustainable and.",

    "Abstract": "Research methodology This case is based entirely on secondary data, including public interviews with Deepinder Goyal, LinkedIn posts, verified press coverage (e.g. NDTV 2024, The Economic Times HR 2023, Business Today, 2025), Zomato’s official blog announcements, investor relations reports and official government releases. Statements attributed to Goyal are drawn from published sources or his verified social media presence.No primary interviews were conducted. No confidential or disguised information is included. Because the case is derived solely from publicly available materials and official disclosures, no IRB approval or ethics board review was required. The case adheres to factual representation and avoids fictionalized internal dialogue.Several prior teaching cases have focused on Zomato and related gig economy firms (Saldanha et al., 2022; Yadav and Goyal, 2022; Subramanian and Choudhary, 2023; Gupta and Prashar, 2023; Pailwar, 2022). These cases emphasized themes such as delivery partner dissatisfaction, attrition, trust deficits and ultra-fast delivery challenges. The present case complements that body of work but differs by centering on empowerment initiatives, including Accelerated Safety Response Program (ASRP), the Shelter Project, Project Arya, maternity insurance and Project ZEAL, and by examining the question of whether such initiatives can be scaled while maintaining financial competitiveness and meeting investor expectations. Case overview/synopsis This case follows Deepinder Goyal, the cofounder and CEO of Zomato, as he grapples with a strategic dilemma in 2024–2025: should Zomato embed worker empowerment into the core design of its gig-based food delivery model, or should it prioritize delivery speed and cost efficiency in an increasingly competitive quick-commerce market?After conducting a covert ride-along as a delivery rider in Jaipur, Goyal launched a portfolio of empowerment initiatives focused on gig worker dignity, inclusion, safety and financial well-being. These included the ASRP, the Shelter Project, financial literacy workshops with the NSE Academy, Project Arya for women’s inclusion, maternity insurance for female riders, Project ZEAL for disability inclusion, an electric vehicle adoption pledge, fuel partnerships, a career ladder program and the Delivery Partner Well-being Framework and Survey.Students are asked to evaluate whether Goyal’s empowerment-first model can scale across India’s cities without undermining profitability or platform efficiency. The case offers an opportunity to apply strategic tools such as institutional theory, structural empowerment theory and dynamic capabilities theory to a real-world dilemma faced by a high-growth, publicly listed Indian food-tech firm. Complexity academic level This case is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate-level courses, especially in programs that cover platform strategy, entrepreneurship or organizational leadership. It has been classroom-tested on an MBA-level Strategic Management course and can be used in both core and elective formats.",

Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research design was used, collecting data from 888 managerial employees (based on purposive sampling) in Pakistan’s telecommunications sector using a Likert scale questionnaire. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to analyze the data. Findings The results indicate that DEEV positively influences both employee ambidexterity and involvement. However, it did not directly affect IWB. Employee ambidexterity and involvement were found to be significant mediators in the relationship between DEEV and IWB. Interestingly, OA did not exhibit a significant moderating effect. Practical implications The findings suggest that organizations should focus on cultivating employee ambidexterity and involvement as key mechanisms to enhance IWB. By leveraging the positive influence of DEEV on IWB, employee ambidexterity and involvement, organizations can create an environment that encourages and supports innovation. Originality/value This research offers originality by investigating the combined mediating roles of employee ambidexterity and employee involvement in the relationship between DEEV and IWB.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Achieving global climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and restoration goals requires innovative solutions that balance carbon sequestration with biodiversity conservation. Payments for ecosystem services markets often treat carbon sequestration and biodiversity separately, but integrating biodiversity as a co‐benefit within carbon farming could improve the environmental outcomes of carbon markets. This study explores the potential for carbon farming strategies in south‐eastern Australia, investigating the trade‐offs and synergies between carbon farming and biodiversity conservation. We aim to evaluate whether modest changes to carbon farming policy could influence biodiversity outcomes, carbon sequestration and economic returns. We develop an optimisation framework to evaluate two carbon farming practices, assisted natural regeneration and environmental planting, under different climate projections and policy scenarios. Our model incorporates carbon sequestration estimates and biodiversity priorities across historical climate and projected climate change defined by the shared socio‐economic pathways, specifically SSP245 and SSP585. The selection of land use change sites is optimised for two policy settings: a least‐cost carbon policy that emulates current market design, and a premium carbon credit policy that provides a 10% premium to maximise biodiversity outcomes without sacrificing carbon sequestration or economic return. Results indicate that biodiversity premiums in carbon credit payments could significantly improve biodiversity outcomes without sacrificing carbon sequestration or economic returns. Spatial analyses reveal shifts in optimal locations for carbon farming under different climate change projections. Previous research on carbon‐biodiversity trade‐offs has overlooked the impacts of current policy settings, eligibility criteria, risk factors and transaction costs. By addressing these gaps, this study provides new insights into how a moderate premium to existing policies could significantly enhance biodiversity co‐benefits within carbon credit schemes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Research summary Crime and violence continue to be problems that plague urban areas across the United States and the globe. One key approach for responding to these problems is “focused deterrence” which includes programs that prevent criminal behavior by blending criminal justice, social service, and community‐based action. While previous systematic reviews have supported the crime control effectiveness of focused deterrence, prior reviews have not included randomized experimental evaluations which are generally recognized to provide stronger causal claims when implemented with fidelity. This updated review of 50 controlled evaluations benefits from the addition of 26 rigorous studies, of which 9 are randomized experimental field trials. This suggests the importance of reassessing the evidence and provides opportunities for additional moderator analyses of program impacts. The overall meta‐analysis suggested that focused deterrence was associated with a statistically significant 23% crime reduction in treatment groups relative to control groups. Meta‐analysis of the 9 randomized experiments suggested focused deterrence generated a smaller 16% crime reduction. Programs designed to reduce gang and group‐involved gun violence were associated with the largest crime reduction impacts. Studies that examined community outcomes generally observed positive impacts. Policy implications A much more rigorous scientific evidence base now exists to support the continued use of focused deterrence to control crime and violence. These analyses, which include randomized controlled trials, provide robust and consistent evidence that focused deterrence reduces crime. Moreover, preliminary results from a group of studies that measure community outcomes, suggest that community residents have positive perceptions of these programs. Program implementation remains challenging with studies noting persistent problems with treatment integrity and sustainability. Further research is also needed to clarify prevention mechanisms so key program activities can be better understood and enhanced.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The Turkestan ground‐jay (Podoces panderi) , a corvid endemic to Central Asia's deserts and steppes, exemplifies how extreme environments drive speciation. Our study provides the first comprehensive high‐resolution genomic analysis of this species, using complete mitochondrial genomes (49 individuals) to decode its population structure and demographic past. Our analyses revealed three highly divergent genetic clusters with strong geographic structure. The P. p. iliensis population (Cluster_3) showed particularly pronounced genetic distinctiveness, with significant differentiation from P. p. panderi (Cluster_2 and Cluster_1) populations. This clear genetic separation supports the taxonomic validity of P. p. iliensis as a distinct evolutionary lineage. Demographic reconstruction indicated that Cluster_2 likely represents the ancestral group, with subsequent southward expansion into the Karakum region. The isolated P. p. iliensis population exhibited signatures of long‐term isolation, including reduced genetic diversity and absence of recent gene flow with other clusters. These results provide strong evidence that P. p. iliensis represents a distinct evolutionary unit. The genetic structuring into three clusters reflects historical isolation in desert refugia during Pleistocene climatic fluctuations. Notably, we detected asymmetric gene flow among three clusters. These findings redefine P. panderi as a model for desert adaptation, where climatic extremes forged genetic fragmentation amid limited dispersal. Beyond taxonomy, our work highlights how aridification sculpted biodiversity in Asia's interior, urging conservation attention for these evolutionarily distinct lineages.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The transition of cetaceans from a terrestrial to an aquatic environment involved a crucial sensory adaptation in environments with limited visibility. Vibrissae, important mechanoreceptors, undergo an ontogenetic transformation in odontocetes. Although most lose them early in life, their follicles persist as innervated vibrissal crypts, suggesting a continuous sensory function. In some species, these crypts could function as mechanoreceptors, electroreceptors, or even be involved in magnetoreception. The Franciscana ( Pontoporia blainvillei ) is a species restricted to the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean. It currently faces high mortality rates due to incidental capture in gillnets, which has led to its current classification as Vulnerable. This research describes the histomorphology of vibrissae and crypts in different developmental stages. The samples were processed using routine histological techniques, immunohistochemistry, and scanning electron microscopy. In neonates, the emerging and innervated vibrissae probably are important for lactation. Subsequently, the vibrissal hair is lost or involutes , being replaced in juveniles and adults by an innervated pseudohair that likely maintains a mechanoreceptive function, although its micromorphology also suggests a potential electroreception. The maturation of the echolocation system, which allows for a broader diet, coincides with these changes in the vibrissae. This suggests that the initial mechanoreceptive structures, linked to lactation, evolve to complement hearing and foraging within low‐visibility environments.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Members of the Onchocercidae family are parasites that infect a wide range of tetrapods, including wild birds and other animals. In Colombia, studies on avian blood parasites have diagnosed infections with microfilariae in several species using light microscopy. However, no morphological or molecular analyses of these nematodes have been conducted to date. The present study examined samples from 3820 wild birds with material deposited in the biological collection of the Host–Parasite Relationship Study Group since 1999. Of these individuals, 142 (3.7%) were infected with microfilaria and were analyzed using morphological and morphometric measurements. Additionally, 55 samples with blood or tissue preserved in ethanol were analyzed for sequencing of nuclear marker 18S rDNA and mitochondrial markers 12S rDNA and COI. Morphological analyses showed infection by at least one of 13 designed morphotypes of microfilariae. Twenty‐nine sequences were obtained (10 of COI, 6 of 12S, and 13 of 18S), corresponding to 21 molecular lineages associated with Onchocercidae. These sequences were associated with the subfamilies Lemdaninae and Splendidofilariinae, the genera Aproctella Cram, 1931 , Splendidofilaria Skrjabin, 1923, and Eufilaria Seurat, 1921, and other sequences did not cluster within any genus for which sequences were available for a particular molecular marker. These findings establish the first framework of morphological and molecular diversity of avian Onchocercidae in the megadiverse Neotropical country Colombia, expanding the known distribution of several genera and highlighting the need for further sampling of adult filariids to refine taxonomic resolution.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and asthma are prevalent conditions that often coexist. These diseases share common inflammatory mechanisms, such as T‐helper cell 2 (T2)‐high inflammation, driven by interleukin (IL)‐4, IL‐5, and IL‐13 cytokines. The frequent comorbidity between CRS, especially CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP), and asthma exacerbates disease severity, impairs quality of life, and complicates treatment. Patients with NSAID‐exacerbated respiratory disease (N‐ERD) represent a severe phenotype of this disease, characterized by the coexistence of CRSwNP, asthma, and NSAID hypersensitivity, which poses unique therapeutic challenges. This EAACI Task Force explores the shared risk factors, including genetic predispositions, epithelial barrier dysfunction, microbiome dysbiosis, underlying CRS, and asthma. It also evaluates current therapeutic strategies such as biologics, aspirin therapy after desensitization (ATAD), and endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS). Biologics have shown their effectiveness and safety in the treatment of asthma and CRS. Dupilumab, mepolizumab, depemokimab, and omalizumab have emerged as transformative therapies, particularly for patients with severe type 2 inflammation. Tezepelulumab is effective for both T2‐high and T2‐low asthma and CRSwNP. Itepekimab has shown its effect in asthma and is under investigation for CRSwNP. Omalizumab is effective in allergic asthma and CRSwNP. ATAD provides an additional disease‐modifying approach for N‐ERD, though patient adherence and tolerability remain critical challenges. ESS significantly improves asthma control, reduces medication use, and enhances sinonasal outcomes, particularly in severe asthma cases; however, these patients often need recurring surgeries. Despite these advances, treatment outcomes vary based on individual phenotypes and endotypes, underscoring the need for personalized approaches. The report highlights gaps in the literature, such as the lack of head‐to‐head trials comparing biologics, ATAD, and surgery. Future research should focus on refining treatment algorithms, identifying biomarkers for treatment selection, and assessing long‐term outcomes to optimize care for patients with CRS, asthma, and N‐ERD.",

The aim of this study was to compare the post‐operative clinical, functional and quality of life outcomes of the SuperPath and Direct Lateral approach in hip osteoarthritis patients undergoing THR . Methods A retrospective analysis was performed of a single‐surgeon consecutive cohort of THR 's. Data was obtained from the St. Vincent's Melbourne Arthroplasty Outcomes ( SMART ) Registry, for all THR 's between 01‐01‐2012 and 31‐12‐2019. Primary outcomes were the patient‐reported WOMAC and VR12 , measured at pre‐op, 12‐ and 24‐month timepoints. Groups were compared using a mixed‐model analysis adjusted for potential confounders. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, surgery duration, complications, readmissions, and reoperations. Results 384 patients were analysed (259 Direct Lateral; 125 SuperPath). Total WOMAC Scores were significantly better for the SuperPath group (mean diff: 7.1, 95% CI 0.76–13.54, p = 0.02). VR12 Total Scores were significantly higher for SuperPath patients (mean diff: 3.9, 95% CI 0.53–7.35, p = 0.02). For secondary outcomes, the SuperPath approach had a shorter operation time than the Direct Lateral approach (81.9 min vs. 85.8 min, mean difference 3.8, 95% CI: 0.14–7.50, p = 0.04). Conclusion Although the SuperPath approach led to slightly better pain, function and quality of life outcomes than the Direct Lateral approach, the difference was below the minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ) although statistically significant. There were no differences in other clinical outcomes except for shorter surgery duration, presumably since there were more cemented procedures in the Direct Lateral group.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Patients undergoing cancer treatment incur significant out‐of‐pocket costs attributed to both medical and non‐medical expenditure. We quantified out‐of‐pocket costs for patients receiving surgical treatment for oesophageal cancer and their financial toxicity. Methods Patients who had undergone oesophagectomy for cancer completed an out‐of‐pocket questionnaire which determined medical costs (e.g., gap payments and medications), non‐medical costs (e.g., travel, accommodation, wage loss) and carer costs (travel and wage loss). Financial toxicity was assessed using the validated Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) questionnaire. Out‐of‐pocket costs and financial toxicity were summarised using medians with bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (1000 resamples). Between‐group comparisons were assessed with Wilcoxon rank‐sum and Kruskal–Wallis tests and associations with income percentiles using Spearman's correlation. Results Seventy individuals completed the survey (43.3% response rate). The majority were male (85.7%), aged 60–79 (76.5%) and 0–5 years post‐cancer diagnosis (55.7%). Median out‐of‐pocket expenditure was $1352 and was mainly attributed to wage loss (64.7%), followed by carer cost (23.7%). Out‐of‐pocket costs were higher for younger age groups (40–59 years) compared to those aged 60–79 years ( p = 0.003). There was no statistically significant difference in out‐of‐pocket costs between public versus privately insured patients. Median out‐of‐pocket costs trended higher for rural ($1696) versus urban located patients ($1235), but this was not statistically significantly different ( p = 0.140). The median financial toxicity score was 23.5 (95% CI: 21.0–27.5), indicating moderate financial toxicity. Financial toxicity did not differ significantly by age, gender, country of birth, education or location. A lower income percentile was associated with greater financial toxicity ( ρ = −0.30, p = 0.012). Conclusion Patients facing oesophagectomy for cancer incur many out‐of‐pocket costs, mostly due to wage loss from time spent away from work for both patients and carers. Younger patients and those with lower income face proportionately greater financial burdens, highlighting a need for targeted support to reduce financial stress.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To describe Australian practices and attitudes regarding equine analgesia. Study Design Cross‐sectional anonymous, voluntary survey of Australian veterinarians treating equine patients. Methods Australian veterinarians in equine or mixed practices completed a six‐section, 60‐question survey between November 2019 to August 2020. Information was gathered on demographics, analgesia prescription, pain assessment and attitudes surrounding specific analgesics. Respondents assigned a pain score ranging from 0 to 10 for various conditions; these were averaged to give each respondent an “average pain score”. Results Data from 153 respondents were included for analysis. The majority of respondents were female (68%). There was no obvious effect of gender on practice type, with approximately half of respondents working in equine exclusive (50.3%) or mixed (49.7%) practice irrespective of gender. Butorphanol was the most frequently used opioid, with 25.5% and 39.2% of respondents using it “every day” and “a few times a week”, respectively. The use of nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) was diverse, with phenylbutazone, flunixin and meloxicam being the most administered. Formal pain scales were infrequently used, with more than 35% of respondents reporting no pain scale being utilised commonly. In response to various clinical scenarios, veterinarians graduating less than 10 years ago were more likely to assign high average pain scores compared to respondents graduating more than 10 years ago (78.0% vs. 66.0%, respectively). Female veterinarians were more likely to assign high average pain severity scores than males (73.0% vs. 60.0%, respectively). However, in the multivariable analysis, none of the predictors were found to be statistically significant. Conclusions This survey demonstrates that demographic factors influence the attitudes of Australian equine veterinarians regarding pain and there may be opportunities to educate and optimise pain assessment and protocol choices.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This article examines the origins, institutional frameworks, and pedagogical strategies of the “touring exhibitions” (“wystawy objazdowe”) program in early Stalinist Poland. Initiated in 1947 under the auspices of the National Museum in Warsaw and rapidly scaled by state cultural authorities, this program brought thematically curated exhibitions to rural and working‐class publics, attracting hundreds of thousands of visitors within its first 3 years. Focusing on two case studies—a 1947 show dedicated to the nineteenth‐century academic painter Jan Matejko and the 1949 exhibition on poets Adam Mickiewicz and Alexander Pushkin—I argue that these displays reinterpreted the Polish art‐historical and literary canon to present state socialism as the culmination of Poland's collective struggle and contested identity. Drawing on pedagogical models inspired by Soviet historical materialism, the exhibitions combined visual didacticism, scripted interpretation, and logistical mobility to fulfill a dual purpose: expanding access to national culture while serving as a vehicle for political propaganda and an instrument of emergent Stalinist state formation.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Anthropogenic climate change is threatening ecosystem functionality and biodiversity globally. While significant research has been dedicated to understanding how organisms may respond to future climate change, most of these studies focus on individual levels of biological organisation in controlled laboratory settings, which often fail to capture the complexity of natural ecosystems. Organisms respond to climate stressors across various levels of biological organisation, which also involve complex interactions or feedback mechanisms among levels, making it difficult to generalise responses to climate change from laboratory experiments or single levels alone. Natural analogues provide a unique opportunity to observe complex ecological interactions in real‐world environments with long‐term exposure to climate change stressors. Here, we provide a systematic literature review to reveal how natural analogues of ocean warming and ocean acidification can be used to assess fish responses to climate change across multiple levels of biological organisation (from molecular to biogeographical scales) and to assess how cross‐level buffering and feedback mechanisms may shape fish species persistence in a future ocean. We identify key knowledge gaps and propose research frameworks that integrate natural analogues with laboratory experiments, mesocosms, and predictive models to better capture the complexity of fish responses to climate stressors in a more holistic way. Finally, we highlight the importance of coordinated, cross‐system research using multiple natural analogues to reveal adaptive mechanisms and strengthen predictions of fish community reorganisation under climate change.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Fish migration through river networks is essential for completing life cycles and accessing critical habitats, but fragmentation increasingly disrupts spawning movements. In Europe, over one million barriers limit connectivity and create trade‐offs between ecological integrity and human uses, such as hydropower, flood control, fisheries and water storage. Furthermore, climate change can decrease habitat suitability, reinforcing migration needs to escape local extinctions. Limited knowledge of environmental triggers constrains species‐specific migration predictions. Here, we quantified the influence of seven environmental triggers—water temperature, flow, turbidity, cloud cover, rain, air pressure and radiation—on spawning migration of European freshwater fishes. A meta‐analysis of 112 studies (685,333 individuals, 953 effect sizes, 50 species) showed that water temperature was the dominant migration trigger. Radiation, turbidity and cloud cover showed weaker, context‐dependent effects, while effects of flow, rain and air pressure were non‐significant. Species‐specific average spawning migration temperatures correlated with upper limits of species‐specific thermal tolerances, indicating that migration timing reflects physiological constraints. Following this argument, we derive a new classification of thermal sensitivity for European freshwater fishes, distinguishing three thermal spawning guilds: cold (&lt; 11°C), cool (11°C–15°C) and warm (&gt; 15°C), with positive migration responses to temperature most frequently in warm‐water, less in cool‐water and rarely in cold‐water species. Our synthesis identifies gaps for species and triggers beyond temperature and flow, providing a quantitative basis for predicting spawning migration timing to guide conservation and connectivity restoration in European rivers.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective This study examined the impact of quality time spent with family in modifying the relationship between various negative home and social consequences of the pandemic and subsequent social and behavioral outcomes. Background Adverse consequences related to economic, health, and social factors were brought about by the COVID‐19 pandemic. In other contexts, family protective factors and resiliency have been found to mitigate similar adverse circumstances. Method This mixed‐method study included participants across five states ( N = 67). Quantitative methods included survey data on individual and family experiences related to work and education, home and social circumstances, and physical and emotional health. Qualitative measures included individual interviews to better understand familial experiences during the pandemic. Results Relationships between negative home life experiences and consequences of the pandemic and subsequent negative outcomes were found to be altered as levels of quality time spent with family and children increased. These results were replicated through robust qualitative data, which told the stories of families using quality time to support positive outcomes. Conclusion Findings suggest that quality time spent with family can be a point of emphasis for mitigating adverse social and health outcomes. Implications Quality time may serve as a low‐cost, accessible relational strategy that can be intentionally emphasized in prevention, intervention, and public health messaging to strengthen family resilience during periods of prolonged adversity.",

    "Abstract": "Cis ‐(+)‐12‐oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) is a bioactive oxylipin and phytohormone participating in regulation of plant stress responses, growth, and development. Due to its α, β‐unsaturated carbonyl moiety, OPDA covalently binds to free thiol groups by Michael addition. This binding, termed OPDAylation, alters the activity of target proteins, such as cyclophilin 20‐3 (EC:5.2.1.8) and thioredoxins, that are essential components of the cellular redox regulatory network. To function as a reversible redox regulatory mechanism, OPDAylation should be complemented by a process of de‐OPDAylation allowing for fine‐tuning of OPDA‐dependent regulation. This study explored OPDAylation and de‐OPDAylation in vitro with emphasis on the involvement of glutathione. OPDA can be transferred from protein to glutathione (GSH) and vice versa . In a competition experiment, OPDAylation of thioredoxins (TRX) occurred rapidly in the presence of GSH, while over extended incubation times, de‐OPDAylation of TRX occurred due to the stoichiometric excess of GSH. These results support the hypothesis that the initial TRX‐based OPDAylation is proceeding under kinetic control due to the higher reactivity of the more nucleophilic cysteine moiety in TRX compared to the one of GSH, while the OPDAylation of GSH observed at prolonged incubation time is then the result of a thermodynamically controlled process. De‐OPDAylation depends on the protein's sensitivity towards OPDA, the pH and the concentration of excess thiol groups. This likely allows for precise modulation of OPDA amounts, as the rapid modification of protein activity enables subsequent induction of OPDA signaling, whereas de‐OPDAylation, triggered by increasing glutathione, increasing cellular reduction or presumably enzymatically, reverses this effect.",

Climbing the career ladder to high‐status positions requires more than just confidence and technical expertise; it necessitates strategic social skills that help female broadcasters navigate male‐dominated networks, deal with discrimination, generate good impressions, and position themselves to capitalize on opportunities. This study's phronetic iterative analysis of in‐depth interviews with six elite female sport broadcasters, from some of the most prestigious and wide‐reaching global sports media organizations, produced novel insights into the politically astute skills that were integral to their career success and longevity. In the face of changing gendered complexities, their strategies included diligent preparation, careful cultivation and maintenance of productive relationships, and judicious decisions about how and when to engage in resistance. With implications for professional preparation and development schemes, the findings break new ground by highlighting the sophisticated relational acuity involved in productively negotiating a power‐ridden, highly competitive, and frequently discriminatory (though changing) industry culture.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Ciprofol, a novel sedative‐hypnotic agent and structural analog of propofol, has emerged as a promising sedative agent in recent years. However, its efficacy in mechanically ventilated intensive care unit ( ICU) patients is not well understood. Aims To compile and synthesise the existing evidence on the efficacy and safety of ciprofol compared to propofol in mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CNKI databases from inception to June 2025 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ciprofol and propofol in ICU settings. Outcomes analysed included sedation success, hypotension, time to extubation, rescue sedation and bradycardia. Meta‐analysis was then conducted to quantitatively assess and compare these outcomes between ciprofol and propofol. Results Three RCTs, comprising 228 participants, were included. There was no significant difference in sedation success between ciprofol and propofol (risk ratio (RR) = 0.989, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.809–1.209; P = 0.913), indicating that ciprofol is as efficient as propofol (the gold standard in this area) in inducing sedation. Ciprofol was associated with a lower risk of hypotension, although this association did not reach statistical significance (RR = 0.668, 95% CI = 0.397–1.124; P = 0.128). Similarly, the mean difference in time to extubation was not significant (MD = −2.98 min, 95% CI = ‐6.80 to 0.83; P = 0.125). Rescue sedation rates also did not differ significantly (RR = 0.786, 95% CI = 0.163–3.800; P = 0.764), and no significant difference was found in the risk of bradycardia (RR = 0.874, 95% CI = 0.298–2.558; P = 0.805). Across all outcomes, heterogeneity was negligible ( I 2 = 0.0%). Conclusions Ciprofol demonstrates comparable efficacy and safety to propofol for ICU sedation in mechanically ventilated adults. Further large‐scale RCTs are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Thinning operations in forestry typically involve a two‐machine system (TMS) with a harvester and a forwarder. Its productivity in different forest conditions is well documented. To date, drones have been used for data collection and surveillance but not as an alternative to a TMS. Drone systems are now being developed for thinning operations for removal of smaller trees, but little is known about their productivity and configuration. Two important advantages of drone systems are reduced soil damage and CO 2 emissions. We propose an evaluation approach that describes drone systems in detail and enables a direct comparison with a standard TMS. This approach is then tested on a large case study comprising 1171 harvest areas with diverse characteristics with regard to, for example, flying and forwarding distance, wetness, and steepness defined through detailed digital terrain models. We perform sensitivity analyses on a set of drone system configurations regarding the number of drones, battery system, system parameters, automation level, CO 2 tax level, and soil damage cost. The results show that the drone system requires less energy, but with no automation and only four drones in a system, the TMS system is more competitive in virtually all harvest areas. However, with eight drones in a system and a higher automation level, the drone system is competitive in up to 50% of the harvest areas. This figure increases if a CO 2 tax and a cost related to soil damage are included.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Research inspired by the social identity theory of leadership has focused predominantly on the importance of a leader being seen to be representative of the groups they lead. However, beyond this, research suggests that leaders also need to create, advance, and embed a sense of shared social identity in those groups. In the present research, we explore how these different facets of identity leadership combine to form distinct leader profiles. We draw on two heterogeneous independent samples from the Global Identity Leadership Development project ( N = 7682; N = 7855) to explore profiles of leaders’ engagement in identity leadership. In both studies, a latent profile analysis of the results of a CFA using a bifactor‐( S − 1) model was conducted. In each case, the analysis identified two different predominant identity leadership profiles: ‘engaged identity leaders’ and ‘moderate‐inconsistent identity leaders’. Employees working with engaged identity leaders reported substantially more positive job‐related attitudes. The results were very similar across the two studies and suggest that this profile analysis is generalizable. The findings support suggestions that identity leadership is multidimensional rather than solely a matter of identity prototypicality.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This article examines the adaptive stability of the European Union's long‐term budget from the Delors I package of 1988–1992 to the Multiannual Financial Framework of 2014–2020, focusing on the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Cohesion Policy. Building on incrementalism, punctuated equilibrium, historical institutionalism and rational choice coalition theories, we propose the theory of Adaptive Budget Stability. To examine the explanatory value of the theory, we analyse quantitative data on national contributions and allocations from 1987 to 2020 to calculate Net Budget Balances, followed by a K‐means cluster analysis to identify potential coalitions. Our findings reveal that funding for CAP is more stable due to the consistent support from major net contributors. Conversely, Cohesion Policy is more prone to reform as no major net contributor maintains a long‐term interest in preserving it.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aims/Introduction To investigate the safety of anagliptin/metformin combination tablets by evaluation of lactic acid levels in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and moderate renal impairment. Materials and Methods The participants of type 2 diabetes with creatinine‐based eGFR (eGFRcr) of ≥45 and &lt;60 (mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) (Group G3a) received anagliptin/metformin combination LD tablets (anagliptin: 100 mg, metformin hydrochloride: 250 mg/tablet) twice a day for 4 weeks. After 4 weeks, they received anagliptin/metformin combination HD tablets (anagliptin: 100 mg, metformin hydrochloride: 500 mg/tablet) twice daily until after 16 weeks. The participants (Group G3b) with baseline eGFRcr ≥30 and &lt;45 (mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) received anagliptin/metformin combination LD tablets twice daily for 16 weeks. The serum lactic acid levels were examined at weeks 4, 8, and 16 after receiving anagliptin/metformin combination tablets. Results The change in serum lactic acid levels from baseline to 16 weeks was −0.09 [−0.28, 0.10] mmol/L (mean [95% confidence intervals]), not exceeding the pre‐specified non‐inferiority margin (0.7 mmol/L). No significant differences occurred in the change in serum lactic acid levels during all observation periods. Serum lactic acid levels exceeded 2.5 mmol/L in four participants (10.5%) and 5.0 mmol/L in one participant (2.6%) during the observation period. No participant had a plasma metformin exceeding 2.5 μg/mL. Conclusions This study demonstrates that the fixed‐dose combination of anagliptin and metformin can be used safely in patients with type 2 diabetes complicated by moderate renal dysfunction. The advantage of this fixed‐dose combination is also considered to be very large.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Analyzing longitudinal patient‐reported outcomes (PROs) remains methodologically challenging, particularly in populations with high mortality rates during follow‐up. Many PRO studies overlook this issue, potentially leading to biased estimates and limited clinical interpretability. We discuss various methods for analyzing patients who died during follow‐up in PRO analyses and examine how these methods affect the interpretation of the study outcomes, using a clinical example in older patients with cancer. Methods For our clinical example, we included adults aged 70 years with cancer from a prospective cohort. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed with the EuroQoL 5‐Dimension (EQ‐5D) tool at baseline and 6 and 12 months after treatment initiation. We applied six different methods: Four methods calculated absolute changes in mean scores; two methods estimated the proportion of patients with a changed QoL. Results Of the 1218 participants, 321 (26%) died within 12 months. Methods restricted to the 897 survivors at the end of follow‐up lead to results that are difficult to interpret due to selection bias. In linear mixed models, EQ‐5D scores are implicitly reconstructed for the 321 participants that died, creating a hypothetical view of QoL assuming no patients died. Alternative approaches, such as the “while‐alive” strategy or composite endpoint strategies, treating death as the worst possible score on the EQ‐5D, produce more complete views of the QoL. Conclusions The interpretation of longitudinal PROs strongly depends on the chosen method, associated estimands and how patients that died are addressed: different methods lead to different estimates and conclusions. Properly defining the research question and choosing the most appropriate method is essential for meaningful interpretations for clinicians and patients.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Black midwives today and in the past have indicated their motivation to provide physically and emotionally safe perinatal care that includes building meaningful relationships, equitably sharing information, spending more time with clients, and providing racially concordant care. An unexplored element within the literature the consideration of a patient's environment. This work seeks to understand the importance of this element in a patient's care and reproductive experience. Methods Semistructured interviews (60‐75 minutes) of 5 Black midwives across the continental United States were conducted to answer the research question How do considerations of the environment shape Black midwives’ care praxis? Participants held a variety of licensing designations; 3 were certified nurse‐midwives, 1 was a certified midwife, and 1 was originally unlicensed but later became a certified professional midwife. Abductive analysis was used, and multiple rounds of coding were conducted to produce themes. Results Three general categorizations of environment emerged: (1) natural or climatic environment, (2) social environment, and (3) caregiving environment. Environmental consideration informs anticipatory guidance , or experiences witnessed and participated in that inform how midwives will advise a future patient. This anticipatory guidance demonstrates how Black midwives draw on their embodied knowledge of past experiences to inform and personalize their care for current and future patients. Discussion Black midwives consider the environment in a multiplicity of ways to inform their care and how it may impact a pregnancy. Awareness of both the natural and social environment of a patient informs the midwives on relevant aspects of the patient's history and steers the Black midwives’ anticipatory guidance, which can go beyond just one patient. Overall, the consideration of the environment for Black midwives does not necessarily change the quality or type of care they administer, but instead informs how to approach care so that they can provide a more personalized experience for patients.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aims Continuous pulse oximetry monitoring has been used in patient deterioration recognition systems for decades. For patients on supplemental O2 , questions related to the effectiveness of this approach have been raised due to elevation of SpO2 from O2 therapy. We examine this issue in the context of a stable inpatient continuous pulse oximetry‐based rescue system with the aim of ascertaining if patients receiving supplemental oxygen are at risk of experiencing clinically meaningful delays in deterioration recognition as compared to patients on room air. Design Retrospective observational analysis. Methods Clinical markers of deterioration recognition timeliness and impact were compared for patients receiving various levels of supplemental oxygen and those on room air over 6 years. Chart review was conducted to assess cause and likelihood of preventability and improvement in detection with other monitoring modalities for emergent cases. Results Analysis adjusted for patient characteristics, and population level supplemental oxygen use showed no difference between patients on supplemental oxygen vs. room air for transfer rate, emergent transfer rate, or death after rescue or transfer. Analysis excluding population supplemental oxygen modeling showed limited increases in event likelihood, but not for emergent transfers. Chart review of emergent transfers revealed no pattern of delay in recognition of deterioration for patients on supplemental oxygen. Conclusions This study found no evidence that pulse oximetry‐based continuous monitoring significantly degrades or delays detection of severe deterioration episodes for patients receiving supplemental oxygen. These findings challenge arguments suggesting pulse oximetry is not an appropriate continuous monitoring modality for general care patients receiving oxygen. Implications for the Profession and/or Patient Care This study provides clinical nurses with information about using continuous monitoring when caring for patients who are receiving supplemental oxygen in the general care setting. The study also assesses patient safety of the practice of using pulse oximetry for monitoring in this patient population. Impact This study addresses concerns related to using continuous pulse oximetry monitoring for deterioration detection when patients are receiving supplemental oxygen. This study found no evidence that pulse oximetry‐based continuous monitoring significantly degrades or delays detection of severe deterioration episodes for patients receiving supplemental oxygen. The results can be used by the inpatient nursing community to ensure safe practices are in place for patient care. Reporting Method This study adheres to the STROBE reporting method.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Metabolic dysfunction–associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease globally, but its prevalence and severity remain poorly characterized in the general population. Our aim was to estimate the prevalence of MASLD and the risk of advanced fibrosis in a large Swedish general population cohort. Methods From the Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study (SCAPIS) cohort, we analyzed 27,763 participants aged 50–64 years who underwent extensive clinical characterization. MASLD was defined as &lt;48 HU on non‐contrast liver computed tomography (CT) imaging. The risk for advanced fibrosis was assessed using the dynamic aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine transaminase (ALT) ratio. Results MASLD was present in 18.1% of participants and was more common in men than women (25.5% vs. 11.2%). Prevalence increased with cardiometabolic burden: from 7.0% among those without obesity, hypertension, or Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to 70.2% among those with all three conditions. MASLD risk was elevated in individuals with obesity alone (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 5.56; 95% CI = 4.89–6.31), T2DM alone (aOR = 2.66; 95% CI = 2.13–3.33), or hypertension alone (aOR = 1.78; 95% CI = 1.59–1.99). The combination of all three conferred the highest risk (aOR = 17.1; 95% CI = 14.0–20.9). Among persons with MASLD, 24.8% were classified as at risk for advanced fibrosis. Fibrosis risk was independently associated with hypertension (aOR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.24–1.66), T2DM (aOR = 1.24; 95% CI = 1.06–1.46), male sex (aOR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.02–1.42), and alcohol consumption (aOR per gram/day = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.01–1.03). Conclusions In Sweden, almost one in five middle‐aged adults is affected by MASLD, with a quarter of cases at risk of advanced fibrosis. Male sex, obesity, T2DM, and hypertension are important predictors of the prevalence and severity of MASLD.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Evidence regarding the risk of new‐onset myasthenia gravis (MG) following statin therapy initiation is limited. Objectives To investigate this potential adverse effect using multinational real‐world population‐based data. Methods A self‐controlled case series (SCCS) study was conducted using electronic medical records and claims databases from Hong Kong, the United Kingdom (UK) and Japan. Individuals aged ≥18 years with first diagnosis of MG and initiated statins were included. Conditional Poisson regression compared the risk of MG in different risk periods (up to 2 years after initiation) with non‐exposure period, adjusted for age. Pooled results based on meta‐analysis across all study sites were reported. Results In total, 2267 MG cases were analysed. Combined across all study sites, a significantly increased risk of incident MG was observed during the first year after statin initiation compared to non‐exposure period, with a higher risk from Days 0–179 (pooled incidence rate ratio [IRR] [95% CI]: 2.662 [1.276–5.553]) than Days 180–364 (1.407 [1.014–1.954]). No increased risk of MG was observed more than 1 year after statin initiation (1.011 [0.848–1.206]). Moreover, the magnitude of MG risk elevation within the first 180 days after statin initiation was more pronounced with higher intensity statin regimens. Conclusion In this multinational SCCS study, statin initiation may be associated with increased risk of new‐onset MG during the first 6–12 months, with greater magnitude of risk elevation for higher intensity statin therapy. Consideration of the possibility of new‐onset MG may be advisable within first 6–12 months after initiating statins, especially for medium‐to‐high‐intensity statin therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose This in vitro study aimed to investigate the effect of different grit sizes of dental burs on the marginal adaptation of lithium‐reinforced glass–ceramic restorations. The objective was to determine if finishing with fine‐grit burs after initial preparation with coarser‐grit burs enhances the marginal adaptation of restorations produced using computer‐aided design and computer‐aided manufacturing (CAD‐CAM) technology. Materials and methods Fifty impacted human molar teeth with intact enamel were extracted and divided into five groups ( n = 10 per group). For group 1, a neutral band chamfer bur (107 µm) was used, while for group 2, a black band bur (181 µm) was used. A green band bur (151 µm) was used for group 3. For group 4, preparation was done using a black band bur and finished with the red band bur (46 µm), while for group 5, a green band bur was used for preparation and finished with the red band bur. Three‐dimensional (3D) scans of the prepared teeth were obtained using an intraoral scanner (Virtuo Vivo, Dental Wings), and CAD software was used to design the crowns. The restorations were milled from lithium disilicate blocks (IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent) on a chairside milling machine (M10, Camcube). Marginal gap assessment on the buccal, mesial, palatal/lingual, and distal surfaces by a stereomicroscope at 20× magnification and with 840 LP/mm resolution was performed. The measurements were performed for 32 equidistant points per sample, totaling 1600 points. ImageJ software was used for the analysis. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used on 10 samples for validation. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney U tests at the 0.05 significance level. Results There was a statistically significant difference in marginal adaptation between the different groups, with groups 4 (Black–Red) and 5 (Green–Red) showing a better marginal fit ( p &lt; 0.05). Within each group, no significant difference was observed between the buccal, mesial, distal, and palatal sides. Conclusion Finishing tooth preparation with a fine‐grit red diamond bur after using coarser‐grit burs significantly enhances the marginal adaptation of glass–ceramic restorations produced by CAD‐CAM technology. This technique could lead to better clinical outcomes in patients treated with such restorations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study examined longitudinal associations between early adolescents' emotional responding and use of cognitive reappraisal and the stability of their friendships with grade‐mate peers. The sample consisted of 152 early adolescents (53.29% female) in the sixth and seventh grades from three rural southeastern middle schools who provided school‐based peer nominations of their friendships. A stability index of adolescents' close friendships was computed from in‐school peer nominations collected at two time points, approximately 1 year apart. Adolescents self‐reported their levels of emotional responding, habitual use of cognitive reappraisal, and peer relationship quality during assessments. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we also examined the behavioral and neural correlates of emotional responding to negatively and positively valenced stimuli in an affective pictures task. We found that greater self‐reported emotional responding predicted less close school‐based friendship stability across 1 year, even controlling for adolescents' characterizations of global peer relationship quality. Self‐reported reappraisal use did not predict friendship stability. However, reappraisal use interacted with neural reactivity to negative stimuli in regions of visual cortex (ventral occipitotemporal cortex) to predict friendship stability; among adolescents reporting moderate to high reappraisal use, greater neural activation in ventral occipitotemporal cortex was associated with more stable friendships across 1 year, whereas among those reporting markedly low reappraisal use, greater activation was associated with fewer stable friendships. These findings provide valuable—albeit preliminary—insights about affective predictors of friendship stability during a life stage critical to social development.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Labor provisions in preferential trade agreements are becoming increasingly relevant, yet research has predominantly focused on global trends and developed economies. In Latin America, scholars have focused either on country‐specific analyses or on individual agreements, resulting in a fragmented approach. The objective of this article is to identify the determining factors that explain the depth of labor provisions in Latin American preferential trade agreements. We conduct a cross‐sectional analysis, employing linear regressions on data from 114 preferential trade agreements signed 1990–2015. Our research delves into government political orientation, trade union participation, informality rates, and intra‐industrial competition to provide a comprehensive analysis. Our findings reveal that interactions among freedom of association and wage bargaining, regime type and stability (rather than political orientation), and trade openness and intra‐industrial competition shape the depth of labor standards in preferential trade agreements in Latin American countries. These findings highlight the relevance of regional approaches in contrast with global studies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Despite awareness of the challenges in promoting the decarbonization of the economy, explicit fossil fuel subsidies have increased considerably worldwide in the past decade, reaching an all‐time high at US$1 trillion in 2022. Considering the net‐zero transition and the increase of modern public debt, this article assesses the most relevant subsidies for fossil fuels in Brazil and how, due to some conflict with ongoing deficits in the national public budget, they neither adhere to energy justice principles nor foster energy transition. Brazil currently allocates a substantial 2.0% of the country's gross domestic product for subsidies, considering both implicit and explicit calculated values. We observe that in certain years, almost one‐third of the nominal investment budget has been waived in tax revenue from Repetro, a production‐focused preferential tax treatment for the oil and gas industry, with no performance standards set on the beneficiaries. Conclusions indicate that the country should consider an early phase‐out of Repetro and would be better served through the expansion of policies aimed at reducing fuel poverty by increasing direct financial transfers to low‐income consumers, such as Gas Aid, which is currently relatively modest in value and has a relevant regional and social distributional outcome.",

    "Abstract": "Summary Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are evolutionarily conserved, yet their functions in plant growth and development remain incompletely characterized. Here, we demonstrate that a HSP90 co‐chaperone PpNudC6 is essential for directional cell expansion in the moss Physcomitrium patens . We generated ppnudc6 mutants and characterized their phenotypes. Dysregulation of PpNudC6 disrupts cellulose microfibril organization and cell wall stiffness gradients, as shown by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, ultimately resulting in shortened and thickened protonemal cells. Mechanistically, this phenotype is mediated by disrupted reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. Loss of PpNudC6 function induces ectopic activity of the NADPH oxidase PpRbohD in protonemata, leading to abnormal ROS accumulation. Pharmacological inhibition of NADPH oxidases by diphenyleneiodonium rescues mutant phenotypes, confirming ROS overproduction as the primary driver of developmental defects. Furthermore, PpNudC6 interacts with the scaffold protein PpRACK1B and the co‐chaperone PpSGT1, suggesting a multisubunit complex that modulates respiratory burst oxidase homolog (Rboh) activity. In summary, our findings reveal a chaperone‐mediated regulatory module that mediates the production of ROS, thereby maintaining cell wall mechanical anisotropy required for directional expansion. This work provides insights into a novel role of HSP complexes in regulating directional cell expansion and links redox homeostasis to cell wall mechanics during moss development.",

    "Abstract": "Summary Land plants follow an evolutionary trajectory of ‘gametophyte reduction’ and ‘sporophyte dominance’. As a major shift in gametophyte reduction, gymnosperms have evolved a unique female gametophyte (FG) development mode, associated with their prolonged reproductive cycles. However, the genetic programs underlying this process remain largely unknown. Here, we employed anatomical, transcriptomic, and genetic approaches to investigate the female gametogenesis, focusing on the divergent coenocytic free nuclear stage in three species ( Cedrus deodara , Picea smithiana , and Pinus tabuliformis ) from the largest gymnosperm family Pinaceae. We obtained a comprehensive anatomical profile of FG development, correlating variations in the timing of the free nuclear stage with the diverse reproductive cycles. We also revealed the transcriptional dynamics underlying each stereotypical stage of FG development, highlighting the involvement of cyclin‐dependent kinase 2a, cyclin B genes, specific MADS‐box genes, and other conserved homologous transcription factors. Moreover, a focused examination of the fascinating long reproductive cycle of Pinus , the largest genus of gymnosperms, further unveiled regulatory molecules for growth–defense trade‐off and summer dormancy of FG. Our study highlights the molecular mechanisms underpinning heterochronic development of FG during the free nuclear stage in Pinaceae, offering crucial insights into the evolution of plant reproductive strategies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objectives To assess healthcare professionals’ attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare and to identify personal and professional factors shaping these attitudes. Design A cross‐sectional, descriptive study conducted in accordance with the STROBE checklist. Sample The study sample consisted of 329 healthcare professionals working in Turkey. Measurements Data were collected between October and December 2024 using Google Forms and a snowball sampling approach. The Personal and Professional Information Form and the General Attitudes Toward AI Scale were used. Results Healthcare professionals’ attitudes toward AI were found to be moderately positive overall. Physicians demonstrated more favorable attitudes than nurses, while younger participants, those with higher educational attainment, and male participants reported more positive attitudes toward AI. Conclusions While physicians generally demonstrated positive attitudes toward AI, substantial knowledge gaps and concerns remain among other healthcare professionals, particularly nurses. These findings underscore the need for policy‐driven integration of AI competencies into undergraduate health sciences curricula and structured continuing professional development programs. Establishing ethical governance frameworks and standardized educational strategies is essential to ensure responsible use, safeguard data privacy, and promote equitable integration of AI across all healthcare roles.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Despite extensive evidence that emotion and cognition are deeply intertwined, the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) lacks an analytically independent emotional mechanism in its causal architecture—an omission that may be particularly consequential in policy subsystems structured around morally charged, identity‐laden policy disputes. To bridge this gap, this conceptual article focuses on patterns of coalition membership and examines how policymakers navigate their roles across policy subsystems. At times, they act as emotionally anchored members of advocacy coalitions; at other times, they promote coalition aims without such anchoring; and in yet other contexts, they operate through technocratic discourse guided by expertise, evidence, or institutional duty—outside coalition dynamics, though never entirely impartial. The article proposes novel theoretical extensions, including emotional anchoring of policymakers , affective policy subsystems , and affective brokerage , to better capture the mechanisms through which emotions shape coalition membership, often independently of or prior to belief alignment. To the extent that emotional anchoring is durable, its effect can persist over time, shaping coalition stability, strategic behavior, policy‐oriented learning, and policy change. To operationalize these extensions, the article explores methods for measuring externally expressed and internally felt emotions.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Apathy is a common symptom in degenerative diseases such as dementia. In this study, we developed the Japanese version of the brief Dimensional Apathy Scale (b‐J‐DAS), which requires caregivers to rate patient apathy using three apathy sub‐scales: executive, emotional and initiation. Methods Study 1 recruited 429 non‐clinical participants, and Study 2 recruited 52 patients with dementia and their caregivers. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted to identify the factor structure of the b‐J‐DAS. Reliability and convergent/discriminant validity were assessed based on correlations between the b‐J‐DAS and apathy, depression, and executive function measures. The association between the caregiver‐rated b‐J‐DAS and care burden was also examined. Results The b‐J‐DAS had the same factor structure as the Japanese version of the self‐rated DAS. Except for self‐rated scores in patients with dementia, the b‐J‐DAS demonstrated acceptable reliability. Significant positive correlations with apathy and executive function measures were observed, as were negative and no correlations with depression measures. Executive and initiation apathy were correlated with care burden. Conclusions The present findings suggest that the b‐J‐DAS, which requires caregivers to assess patient apathy, is a suitable multidimensional apathy scale with acceptable reliability and validity. However, further studies on the influence of caregiver‐related factors are required.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Secondary Lower‐Limb Lymphedema (LLL) is a frequent, progressive late effect affecting women after gynaecological cancer treatment, causing swelling due to fluid accumulation in the interstitial spaces in the lower extremities, the lower abdomen, hips and genitals. There is no consensus on how to define and quantify LLL, which makes research on treatment effect difficult. A negative relation between LLL and quality of life has been reported. Aim To review the literature concerning the identification and impact of LLL on women's lives after gynaecological cancer, including physical, psycho‐social and existential aspects. Methods In an integrative review, as described by Whittemore &amp; Knafl, data were thematically analysed. Results Forty‐one papers published between 2003 and 2024, encompassing a total of 11,488 participants, were included. The overarching theme was limited knowledge of LLL among healthcare professionals and patients and identification discrepancies. It highlighted a widespread lack of awareness among healthcare professionals and the absence of a standardised approach to LLL assessment. This was further substantiated by the considerable heterogeneity in both diagnostic and measurement methods. Consequently, women received minimal information, experienced delayed diagnoses and had restricted access to treatment. These shortcomings had a negative impact on daily life, affecting physical and psychosocial wellbeing, as well as sexual health. The women reported unmet needs, which led them to adopt proactive approaches and various coping strategies. Conclusion LLL profoundly affects women's quality of life, physical and psychosocial health and existential well‐being. Lack of standardised assessment and diagnostic criteria and clear care pathways creates knowledge gaps, delays diagnosis and fragments care, while its ‘homeless’ status leaves responsibility unclear. Urgent systemic change is needed: research must define evidence‐based strategies and policy makers should prioritise multidisciplinary centres and education, with healthcare adopting patient‐centred, multidisciplinary practices to ensure timely diagnosis, referral and self‐management support.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The COVID‐19 pandemic exposed the vulnerability of immunocompromised hosts and the scarcity of evidence guiding their management. Within the European Horizon 2020 ORCHESTRA project, a multinational consortium connected existing and new cohorts to harmonize data, laboratory methods, and clinical expertise across fragile populations. The fragile patients’ cohort became a model for how collaborative infrastructure can generate actionable evidence during a crisis. Through prospective follow‐up and centralized immunologic assessment, ORCHESTRA defined the clinical spectrum of COVID‐19 in transplant recipients, identified vaccine‐modified disease phenotypes, and clarified the kinetics and correlates of immune protection. The project also demonstrated the feasibility of real‐time immunologic monitoring, the value of data interoperability, and the need for adaptive harmonization across health systems. Integrating these results through Delphi consensus, ORCHESTRA translated research into practice, providing pragmatic guidance for clinicians across Europe. This experience underscores that harmonized, multidisciplinary research—rooted in collaboration and flexibility—can transform variability into knowledge and ultimately improve care for the most immunologically fragile patients.",

This paper explores deterrents to plasma donation among current plasma donors, whole‐blood donors, lapsed whole‐blood donors, and non‐donors in the United Kingdom, and self‐reported post‐donation symptoms in plasma donors. Study Design and Methods An online survey of the UK general public (current and lapsed blood donors, and non‐donors: n = 2861) and English current plasma donors ( n = 448), and one‐to‐one interviews ( n = 25) with plasma donors were conducted. Participants identified deterrents to plasma donation, and plasma donors described post‐donation symptoms. Results Plasma donors reported distinct deterrents around time constraints and ineligibility. There were differences by donor status. Blood, plasma, and non‐donors all report pain, lack of travel compensation, involvement of private companies and incentives as concerns. Lack of awareness was salient for non‐donors and blood donors, while non‐donors had concerns about neurodiversity and donors about incentives to change. Being deferred on the day, described as an embarrassing “walk of shame,” was a unique deterrent to plasma donors. 11.8% (53/488) of plasma donors reported symptoms of feeling ill after donation. Of these, 73% ( n = 38) occurred and were managed in center (e.g., feeling faint, bruising) and 25% ( n = 13) outside of the center (e.g., feeling faint) and managed by the donor (2% other). Discussion Different profiles of deterrents were observed for plasma donors compared to whole blood and non‐donors. Recommendations for the recruitment and retention of plasma donors in England are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The objective of this review is to synthesize qualitative evidence on the perceptions of health care professionals and policymakers regarding barriers and facilitators to implementing antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programs in hospital settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Introduction: AMS programs are widely recognized as critical interventions to combat antimicrobial resistance and optimize the use of antibiotics. While quantitative studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of AMS programs in reducing inappropriate antibiotic use, less is known about the experiences, perceptions, and contextual factors that influence their implementation and sustainability. Eligibility criteria: This review will include qualitative studies exploring the experiences, perceptions, attitudes, and contextual factors influencing implementation of AMS programs among health care professionals and policymakers. Studies conducted in any health care setting and involving any population relevant to AMS programs will be considered. Methods: The key information sources to be searched for this review include PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus, Embase (Elsevier), and Web of Science. The search will include studies published in any language from 2015 onwards. Study selection will be conducted independently by 2 reviewers, with any disagreements resolved through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer. All included studies will be critically appraised for methodological quality, and only those meeting a predefined threshold will proceed to synthesis. Data relevant to the review objectives will be extracted, followed by an aggregative data synthesis approach. Confidence in the findings will be assessed using a structured grading process based on credibility and dependability. Review registration: PROSPERO CRD420251044164",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Advanced age is the strongest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has also been recognized as a risk factor for ADRD, potentially contributing to an earlier onset of the disease. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms underlying brain ageing and TBI is critical for developing strategies to preserve brain health. Accumulating evidence indicates that arterial ageing, manifested as increased central arterial stiffness, is closely associated with cerebral blood flow (CBF) dysregulation and brain ageing, whereas improvement of CBF regulation through aerobic exercise training contributes to brain health. Emerging studies suggest that central arterial stiffness is elevated after TBI but can be ameliorated by aerobic exercise training, which benefits TBI recovery. In this brief review, we summarize evidence demonstrating that (1) age‐ or TBI‐related increases in central arterial stiffness are associated with CBF dysregulation, and (2) aerobic exercise training improves CBF regulation by reducing central arterial stiffness in both healthy older adults and individuals with chronic TBI. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that central arterial stiffness impacts CBF regulation and highlight aerobic exercise as a promising intervention for preserving brain health in ageing and after TBI.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract A crucial factor indicating the fluid transport capability of rock porous media (RPM) like rocks is permeability. This study introduces a novel deep learning approach called ConViT to enhance the precision and effectiveness of permeability estimation using rock imagery. The ConViT model merges the strengths of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), featuring an innovative Gated Positional Self-Attention (GPSA) module that seamlessly combines the benefits of attention mechanisms with convolutional architectures for RPM analysis. The proposed model uses binarized images of RPM as input, extracts features through GPSA, and ultimately enables end-to-end permeability prediction. Additionally, EigenCAM is used to identify the areas of concern of the RPM to enhance the interpretability of the result. An evaluation of multiple deep learning architectures was performed using the porous materials dataset. Findings reveal that the ConViT model achieves precise permeability estimation for RPM. The coefficient of determination (R2), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the test set are 0.9807, 0.0013, and 0.2663 respectively. Leveraging the model's transfer learning capability, the research findings were successfully applied to permeability prediction of tight sandstone cast thin sections from the Shaximiao Formation, achieving a prediction accuracy of 82.04%. The research results provide a new method for end-to-end permeability evaluation of RPM.",

The optimization of SLM processing window was systematically conducted to create near-dense coupons. Agglomeration of yttria nanoparticles and formation of extensive network of cracks were observed in the ODS versions. Two strategies - a) feedstock powder preparation using ball milling and b) laser remelting - were found to be effective to achieve the homogeneous dispersion of nanoparticles as well as prevent crack formations. For each feedstock powder, tensile testing coupons were produced using the optimized processing parameters and high temperature (1000 and 1100 °C) mechanical testing was conducted. The effect of Y2O3 addition on the high-temperature tensile properties of Haynes 214 was investigated.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Due to technical complexity, precise and safe fibula shaping for mandibular reconstruction remains a challenge. Robots offer high operational precision, and robotic-assisted osteotomy can meet fibular cutting accuracy requirements. Current research mainly focuses on image-guided serial robotic arms for osteotomy. However, due to insufficient stiffness, joint coupling, and complex, non-unique inverse kinematics, the cutting accuracy of serial robots is limited. To address this, this paper proposes a novel hybrid robot system combining a linear delta mechanism for osteotomy and a serial arm for end-effector posture adjustment. The linear delta mechanism provides high stiffness and a unique inverse kinematic solution, overcoming the limitations of serial arms. Based on this configuration, a complete kinematic model is derived, and a robot parameter co-optimization method integrating the hand-eye matrix is proposed. Using an eye-in-hand visual integration approach, this method reduces system cost and improves accuracy. The system's osteotomy accuracy was verified through model experiments. Results showed that, with the hybrid configuration and calibration optimization, the system achieved a cutting position accuracy of 0.87±0.36mm and angular accuracy of 1.13±0.51° during fibular osteotomy. This study demonstrates the system's high accuracy and feasibility, providing effective technical support for mandibular reconstruction surgery.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper introduces a novel stiffness-based Assist-as-Needed (AAN) control strategy aimed at optimizing the balance between robotic assistance and patient engagement in wrist rehabilitation. Central to the proposed approach is a joint stiffness estimation technique that enables precise, direction-specific assessment of the patient's motor condition. The derived stiffness profile is utilized to adaptively modulate key AAN control parameters, specifically the radius and velocity of the error tolerance circle, thereby individualizing assistance according to the patient's functional capacity. Additionally, the framework facilitates sensorless implementation of AAN control by employing a series elastic actuator, which permits accurate torque control and interaction force estimation using only encoder feedback. This design choice minimizes hardware complexity and cost, while maintaining desirable system characteristics such as backdrivability and compliance. Experimental results validate the efficacy of the proposed method, demonstrating its superiority over conventional AAN approaches in minimizing unnecessary robotic assistance and enhancing voluntary motor involvement. The presented strategy offers a scalable, quantitatively informed control paradigm suitable for precision rehabilitation across diverse impairment levels.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The complex structure, infinite degrees of freedom, and non-linearity of soft actuators make dynamic modeling one of the most challenging tasks in the field of soft robotics. Furthermore, few studies on general dynamic modeling methods for soft actuators with varying structures has been conducted to date. This paper introduces a novel modeling approach for symmetrically chambered soft bending actuators, offering a simple, low-cost, and highly practical solution. First, the actuator with a rectangular cross-section is taken as the standard type to build an analytical prototype model. Next, a structural equivalence method is proposed to convert non-standard actuators into standard types, making them suitable for the prototype model. Finally, the dynamic model of the non-standard actuator is developed by combining the prototype model with error compensations. Four soft actuators with different cross-sections were fabricated to verify the modeling approach's feasibility. The results proved that it is simple to obtain the dynamic models of various soft actuators using the proposed method. Model-based angle tracking experiments for these four actuators were conducted to confirm the effectiveness and usefulness of the dynamic models developed with the proposed modeling method.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The SDelta is a six-degree-of-freedom (six-dof) parallel kinematics machine (PKM) designed for high-speed operations. It features a cylindrical-prismatic-spherical (CPS) joint structure. The orthogonal SDelta (OSD) is a variant thereof, with a cube-shaped base platform (BP) and orthogonal limbs. The OSD offers better workspace and dexterity characteristics than the SDelta and the classical six-dof PKM, namely the Stewart platform. This paper reports the inverse dynamics model of the OSD mechanism using the virtual-work principle. Joint forces and torques are computed for a predefined trajectory of its moving platform (MP). Simulation results verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed dynamics model. Additionally, the dynamics performance of the mechanism is evaluated based on its force-transmission characteristics and three force-sensitivity indices defined for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) across two types of workspace: translational and orientational. Comparative analysis with the Stewart platform indicates that the OSD mechanism exhibits high performance in terms of these indices, suggesting its potential for applications requiring safe interaction and external-force measurement on the moving platform.",

    "Abstract": "Eukaryotic gene expression is orchestrated by RNA polymerases (RNAPI, II, and III) and associated factors, yet their real-time dynamics remain obscure. Using single-molecule tracking in living yeast, we quantified the kinetics of 58 proteins encompassing three RNAP machineries. RNAPI and RNAPIII pre-initiation complexes (PICs) engage in long-lived chromatin interactions, contrasting with transient RNAPII PIC. We further report kinetics of RNAPII-associated factors for elongation, histone modification, C-terminal domain (CTD) modification, RNA processing, and termination. Many elongation factors show brief rather than persistent association, suggesting dynamic interactions with factor exchange, allowing a potential repertoire of regulatory events. CTD truncation reduces U1 snRNP residence time and intron retention in ribosomal protein genes, providing insights into co-transcriptional splicing. Our findings establish a framework of dynamic interactions of RNAP machineries.",

    "Abstract": "The sugarcane genus Saccharum is characterized by complex genomes with diverse ploidy levels. We developed a multiscale graph–based pangenome representation, which integrates nine genome assemblies into a unified reference, representing modern cultivars and founding species. Each homo(eo)logous (encompasses both homologous and homeologous relationships) chromosome set retains 47 to 57 haplotypes and ~74,000 to 271,000 gene alleles. This framework enables multiomics exploration, encompassing homo(eo)log systems and epigenomic signatures. The pangenome facilitates population genomics analyses of 417 mixed-ploidy Saccharum accessions, revealing convergent selection and identifying the Andropogoneae TB1 homolog linked to tillering as a promising gene-editing target to boost cane yield. Additionally, the pangenome supports dosage-informed genome-wide association study, improving heritability estimates and identification of sugar or leaf-angle–associated loci, including SaIRX10 and SaBAK5 . Our analytical framework establishes a foundation for graph-based genetic studies in sugarcane and other polyploid genomes.",

    "Abstract": "Priming rare subdominant precursor B cells in germinal centers (GCs) is a central goal of vaccination to generate broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against HIV. Multivalent immunogen display on protein nanoparticle scaffolds can promote such responses, but it also generates scaffold-specific B cells that could theoretically limit bnAb precursor expansion in GCs. We rationally designed DNA origami–based virus-like particles (DNA-VLPs) displaying a germline-targeting HIV envelope protein immunogen, which elicited no scaffold-specific antibody responses. Compared with a state-of-the-art clinical protein nanoparticle, these DNA-VLPs increased the expansion of epitope-specific GC B cells relative to off-target B cells and enhanced expansion of bnAb-lineage B cells in a humanized mouse model of CD4 binding site priming. Thus, minimizing off-target responses enhances bnAb priming and indicates that DNA-VLPs are a promising vaccine platform.",

    "Abstract": "Brassica rapa ( Br ) encompasses many morphotypes and subspecies, so it is a good model with which to investigate plant diversification and subspeciation. Here, we resequenced the genomes of 1720 Br accessions and de novo assembled 11 representative telomere-to-telomere gapless genomes for seven elite subspecies that underwent intensive morphotypification and developed distinct agronomic traits valued to agriculture. We identified 6992 unknown genes, 110 complete (peri)centromeres, and five new satellites associated with Br morphotypes and subspecies and Brassica species evolution. The pangenome, built on 11 gapless and 20 published genomes, reveals structural variations and gene diversities among Br subspecies. Pangenome-wide association studies uncovered that the gene BrLH1 controls leaf-head formation. We show that structural changes have occurred in satellites, (peri)centromeres, and genes, contributing to fast subspeciation and morphotypification during the short history of Br cultivation, providing invaluable resources for Brassica breeding.",

We present experimental evidence that a nonhuman primate can represent pretend objects. Kanzi, a lexigram-trained bonobo, correctly identified the location of pretend objects (e.g., “juice” poured between empty containers), in response to verbal prompts in scaffolded pretense interactions. Across three experiments, we conceptually replicated this finding and excluded key alternative explanations. Our findings suggest that the capacity to form secondary representations of pretend objects is within the cognitive potential of, at least, an enculturated ape and likely dates back 6 to 9 million years, to our common evolutionary ancestors.",

    "Abstract": "Currently, no effective treatment exists for infertility associated with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) because affected patients lack hormone-responsive antral follicles. By screening a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved drug library, we identified finerenone, a kidney disease medication, as a promising drug for restoring fertility in POI. Finerenone stimulated follicle development in aged mice and restored antral follicle development in patients with POI following oral administration, resulting in mature oocytes and embryos. Mechanistically, finerenone reduced fibrotic deposition in the ovarian stroma, alleviating collagen-mediated suppression of follicular development. Building on this insight, we identified additional FDA-approved oral antifibrotic drugs as potential treatments for POI-related infertility. Our findings highlight the ovarian stroma—rather than the follicles themselves—as the key therapeutic target and offer potential therapeutic leads for POI-related infertility.",

Existence of these earthquakes is no longer debated, but their identification remains sparse across the globe. Comparing the Sn and Lg seismic wave amplitude ratio ( Sn/Lg ) of an earthquake with that of nearby earthquakes distinguishes CMEs and, unlike previous methods, can be applied globally. We present a global distribution of CMEs that extends well beyond previous individual detections and areas of speculation. CME occurrence is widespread globally yet patterned regionally, reflecting local lithospheric structure and tectonic history.

We designed coiled-coil bundlemer peptide nanoparticles that form ordered, hierarchical materials across an unusually broad pH range (1, 7, and 14) dependent on patchy surface charge display. Nematic liquid crystal formation was observed at low concentration (~0.5 to 4 weight %) at pH 1 and pH 14, whereas higher concentration at pH 1 yielded hexagonal columnar phases. At neutral pH, the same patchy nanoparticles assembled into ordered lattices through electrostatic complexation. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed end-to-end particle stacking underlying all phases. Coiled coils with identical amino acid composition but lacking designed charge patches displayed no ordered assembly, demonstrating the importance of programmable electrostatic interactions with protein-like specificity of spatial display.",

We report chiral, zwitterionic organoboron complexes that mask amino acid–derived KATs. These molecules exhibit unexpected nitrogen-carbon-boron connectivity and are fully compatible with solid-phase peptide synthesis and stereoretentive deprotection.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Treatment with latency-reversing agents (LRAs) alone has been ineffective in reducing HIV-1 reservoirs in people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) who are on antiretroviral therapy (ART), due to inefficiencies in reservoir reactivation and adaptive immune responses. However, NK cells activated with cytokines may be able to target HIV-1 reservoirs more effectively. To explore the therapeutic potential of NK cells, we expanded blood NK cells from multiple donors ex vivo into CD56 bright CD16 + “eNK” cells using artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs) expressing membrane-bound IL21. eNK cells express multiple activating receptors and are highly cytotoxic against specific target cells. They can also kill HIV-infected CD4+ T cells via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) using broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 Env gp120/gp41. Notably, eNK cells from PLWH on ART efficiently killed autologous HIV-1+ T cells reactivated by a combination of vorinostat (SAHA) and IL-15 or an IL-15 superagonist (N-803), as evidenced by declines in proviral load, inducible HIV-1 mRNA, and virus release. Adoptive immunotherapy with eNK cells combined with LRA treatment thus presents a promising strategy to reduce the latent HIV-1 reservoir in PLWH. IMPORTANCE Antiretroviral therapy (ART) lowers HIV levels in the blood to nearly undetectable amounts, but stopping therapy almost always leads to HIV rebounding in the bloodstream. DNA and RNA tests show that most people living with HIV (PLWH) on ART retain long-lasting HIV reservoirs that remain hidden from the immune system when no HIV is being produced. Eradicating HIV might look like “drug-free remission,” where HIV reservoirs are kept under control by the immune system even if ART is stopped indefinitely. Current strategies for this potential eradication include using HIV latency-reversing agents (LRAs), ex vivo expansion of natural killer (NK) cells, and improving the ability to kill infected cells with broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV. Here, we demonstrate that NK cells from PLWH can be expanded outside the body into “eNK” cells that specifically attack HIV-infected cells without harming uninfected ones, significantly reducing HIV reservoirs in vitro after LRA treatment.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The HerA-NurA complex reportedly functions in DNA end resection in archaea. End resection is important to start homologous recombination by forming a single-stranded DNA region with an overhanging 3′-end, which invades double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with a homologous sequence to form a D-loop. Here, we studied the structure and functions of HerA-NurA from the hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus kodakarensis . Our analyses demonstrated that NurA is a non-directional and single-stranded specific nuclease, but the HerA-NurA complex cleaves both strands of dsDNA in an exonucleolytic manner, regardless of the structure of the DNA end. The 3D structures of HerA-NurA and its complex with dsDNA revealed the detailed molecular mechanisms of these nuclease reactions. These results suggest that HerA-NurA may not be involved in the end resection process but instead performs other functions, such as exerting an antiviral function by degrading the dsDNA of foreign viruses, similar to recent studies in bacteria. IMPORTANCE To understand the specific function of the HerA-NurA complex, which is believed to function in the end resection process to create a 3′-overhanging DNA for the following strand invasion in homologous recombination, we performed biochemical and structural analyses of this complex from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Thermococcus kodakarensis , inhabiting a harsh environment where DNA is easily damaged. We found that the HerA-NurA complex cleaves both strands of double-stranded DNA in an exonucleolytic manner, regardless of the structure of the DNA end. Our structural analysis revealed the detailed characteristics of the nuclease activity exhibited by the HerA-NurA complex. Based on the presented information, it is unlikely that the HerA-NurA complex directly functions in end resection, but rather is involved in other functions, possibly in defense against viral infections.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Taxonomic classification alone fails to capture the ecological and functional diversity of vaginal microbiomes, particularly those dominated by Gardnerella species. Using the expanded VIRGO2 gene catalog, we developed the vaginal inference of subspecies and typing algorithm (VISTA), a novel ortholog-based framework that defined metagenomic subspecies and 25 metagenomic community state types (mgCSTs), including six distinct Gardnerella -dominated profiles. The mgCSTs exhibit marked differences in species composition, functional gene content, transcriptional activity, and host immune responses. These findings reveal that Gardnerella predominance does not uniformly equate to dysbiosis and underscore the importance of functional context in shaping host-microbiome interactions. VISTA provides scalable classifiers and an interactive application to support mechanistic studies of vaginal microbiome function and its implications for reproductive health. IMPORTANCE The vaginal microbiome plays a central role in reproductive and gynecologic health, yet its functional diversity and ecological organization remain poorly understood. Traditional 16S rRNA approaches provide only a partial view of this complexity, overlooking the strain-level variation that often determines microbial behavior and host outcomes. By applying metagenomic sequencing and scalable computational modeling, we developed the vaginal inference of subspecies and typing algorithm, a framework that defines gene-based subspecies and community state types across diverse populations. These classifications reveal new insights into the genomic and ecological foundations of vaginal community structure and offer a standardized resource for comparative and translational microbiome research.

    "Abstract": "This article introduces ‘sonic life writing’ as a new methodological approach to sharing bodily knowledge about illness experience through non-lexical sound and music. Drawing on autoethnographic research conducted during treatment for HER2+breast cancer, I argue that sonic approaches can complement existing counter-narratives by offering non-lexical modes that bypass certain constraints of dominant cancer discourse, such as metaphors of warfare. The conceptual framework of ‘corporeal acoustemology’ extends Steven Feld’s work on ways of knowing through sound into medical and corporeal territories, proposing that bodily processes and treatment experiences can be made audible through compositional practice. This methodology moves beyond data sonification to what I term ‘artistic sonation’—qualitative sonic expression that captures the temporal, relational, emotional, and embodied dimensions of illness that can resist lexical representation. Three original compositions demonstrate this approach: TCH-P transforms chemotherapy experience into rhythmic testimony using South Indian konnakol vocal techniques; KRANKENHAUSFUNK and the extrinsic death receptor pathway reimagines hospital radio by broadcasting the cellular process of apoptosis through repurposed infusion pumps; and Anuvāram Jugalbandī explores the disrupted temporalities of illness and care through intercultural musical dialogue. Theoretically, the article proposes ‘reparative listening’ as a framework for engaging with sonic illness narratives, drawing on Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick’s work on reparative reading and recent scholarship on acoustic justice. This approach creates conditions for witnessing experiences that fall outside conventional narrative structures while challenging the medical emphasis on visual over auditory engagement with bodies. This article and practice-based research positions music and sound not as therapeutic intervention but as testimonial practice and knowledge transmission, contributing to growing intersections between sound studies and health humanities. Sonic life writing offers new possibilities for sharing the complexities of illness experience while expanding our understanding of embodied ways of knowing in medical contexts.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we study a class of inexact block triangular preconditioners for double saddle-point symmetric linear systems arising from the mixed finite element and mixed hybrid finite element discretization of Biot's poroelasticity equations. We extend the theoretical results presented in [Balani et al., NLAA 2024] for general double saddle-point problems with nonzero diagonal blocks, by developing a novel spectral analysis of the preconditioned matrix. This shows that the complex eigenvalues lie in a circle of center (1,0) and radius smaller than 1. In contrast, the real eigenvalues are described in terms of the roots of a third-degree polynomial with real coefficients. Numerical results are reported to show the quality of the theoretical bounds, which generally turn out to be quite tight, and illustrate the efficiency of the proposed preconditioners in the acceleration of GMRES, especially in comparison with similar block diagonal preconditioning strategies along with the MINRES iteration.",

    "Abstract": "In response to extensive cracking and fracture in the segment lining of an underlying shield tunnel subjected to large-scale ground unloading, this paper adopts a real-world shield tunnel project as a case study. The underlying shield tunnel is experiencing overall heaving deformation, characterized by a decrease in its horizontal diameter. The longitudinal joint at the tunnel vault transitions from opening to crushing at the intrados. This paper presents the stress behavior in the tunnel vault, which is characterized by negligible fluctuations in axial force concurrent with a pronounced decrease in bending moment. This indicates that the ground unloading and the increase of tunnel’s vertical diameter constitute the primary causes of the intrados crushing at longitudinal joint of tunnel vault. And the intrados crushing, in conjunction with segment misalignment observed on-site, results in a transition in the interface behavior to a line-to-surface contact. Consequently, the lining stress near the intrados exceeds permissible limits, thereby resulting in subsequent cracking and fracture. The primary threats to the structural safety of segment lining arise from the increased vertical ovalization, the intrados crushing and uneven line-to-surface contact at longitudinal joint of tunnel vault, rather than from the changes in lining stress.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores a layered approach to fibre reinforcement for enhancing the flexural behaviour of self-compacting concrete beams. Polypropylene fibres were placed in tension zones of the cross-section to improve efficiency and utilization. The optimal mix with 0.075% fibre achieved 13.88% higher compressive strength and 15.47% higher tensile strength than the control concrete mix. Durability also improved, with water absorption reduced by 37.03% and chloride ion penetration reduced by 25.64%. Flexural testing was carried out on five beam configurations with fibres at full depth, bottom half, and one-third depth above and below the reinforcement. Half-layered beams with fibres above the tensile reinforcement reached an ultimate load of 149.20 kN and a ductility index of 6.68. They nearly matched fully reinforced beams while using only half the fibre content, offering structural and economic benefits, fibre placement below the reinforcement gives negligible gains. The findings confirm that targeted fibre placement enhances crack resistance, ductility, and energy absorption while reducing fibre use.",

    "Abstract": "Arctic marine mammals are increasingly affected by the combined pressures of climate change and expanding human activity. Although individual stressors such as sea ice loss, underwater noise, and chemical pollution are well studied, their interactive effects remain poorly understood, complicating ecosystem-based conservation. We systematically screened 1,084 peer-reviewed studies from 1984 to 2025 (PRISMA) to identify dominant stressor pathways and species-specific vulnerabilities. Six major stressors emerged: sea ice decline, noise pollution, chemical contaminants, industrial expansion, shifts in prey availability, and disease or biotoxins. We synthesize these findings into a stressor-interaction framework classifying combined effects as additive, synergistic, or antagonistic; Antagonistic interactions occur when the combined effect of two stressors is weaker than expected based on their individual impacts. Across taxa, overlapping pressures reduce movement, foraging success, and habitat use particularly for narwhals, belugas, bowhead whales, and polar bears, whose ice dependence and slow reproduction heighten risk. High-risk combinations, such as contaminant remobilization during nutritional stress or the dual effects of sea-ice loss and industrial noise, highlight the need for dynamic protected areas, strengthened regulatory measures, and co-management approaches incorporating Indigenous knowledge. A clearer understanding of synergistic and cumulative effects is essential as environmental change accelerates.",

This study focuses on several scientists who confronted profound moral dilemmas concerning the bomb’s use against Japan. Some openly opposed its deployment, others sought to warn a Japanese scientist in the hope of averting further devastation, and still, others expressed deep remorse in its aftermath. In addition, the experience of an individual directly affected by the bombing is discussed. By examining these episodes, this article aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on how scientific research should be guided by ethical principles in the future.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Non-Specific Neck Pain (NSNP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder with a multifactorial etiology. Manual therapy techniques, including Mulligan and Maitland mobilisations, are widely used for pain management and functional improvement in NSNP. However, their comparative effectiveness remains insufficiently investigated. Objective: To compare the short-term effectiveness of Mulligan and Maitland mobilisation techniques when combined with a home-based Therapeutic Exercise (TE) program. Methods: A total of 43 adults with NSNP were randomly assigned to three groups: Mulligan [Formula: see text] TE ([Formula: see text]), Maitland [Formula: see text] TE ([Formula: see text]), and a control group receiving TE alone ([Formula: see text]). The TE program was performed daily at home for two weeks, while manual therapy interventions were administered twice per week for a total of four sessions. Pain intensity, functional ability, pain pressure threshold, Range of Motion (ROM), pain catastrophising, and kinesiophobia were assessed before and after the intervention. Results: All three groups demonstrated significant improvements in all outcome measures by the second week. However, no statistically significant differences were found between groups ([Formula: see text]). These findings reflect short-term outcomes only and should be interpreted with caution given the limited two-week intervention period. Conclusion: Neither mobilisation technique demonstrated superiority over the other. The combination of Mulligan or Maitland mobilisation with TE did not provide greater benefits than TE alone. The short intervention duration and absence of long-term follow-up represent key study limitations. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to establish more definitive conclusions.",

    "Abstract": "An optimal preemption framework is proposed to minimize Age of Information (AoI) in single-link systems with stochastic packet arrivals and known packet lengths. The problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) solved through relative value iteration (RVI), demonstrating that packet-length-dependent threshold policies achieve minimal average AoI. For scenarios with unknown traffic statistics, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm learns these thresholds adaptively through real-time interactions without prior distribution knowledge. Numerical evaluations under exponential and bounded Pareto packet length distributions reveal 15.5 percent average AoI reduction compared to non-preemptive baselines using the RVI method, while the DQN method achieves 14.4 percent improvement with less than 1.1 percent performance gap from the optimal policy. Both methods exhibit threshold-driven decision structures that balance immediate AoI reduction against long-term scheduling efficiency. Comparative analysis reveals the framework’s robustness across stationary and dynamic environments, with the DQN maintaining near-optimal performance through dimension-reduced state representation. These results establish a unified solution for AoI minimization that transitions seamlessly between model-aware and model-agnostic configurations, addressing critical challenges in real-time Internet of Things (IoT) networks and status update systems requiring freshness guarantees.",

    "Abstract": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to alleviate data sparsity in the target domain by incorporating knowledge from external domains. Existing approaches typically rely on overlapping users between the source and target domains as a bridge for knowledge transfer. However, in practice, user information across domains is often unavailable due to privacy protection, platform isolation, and data sharing restrictions, rendering most methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose the D2TCDR, a two-stage generative CDR framework to address this critical limitation. By modeling the domain-level distribution that captures user preferences shared across domains, we extract transferable knowledge and guide its transfer through a generative process, reducing reliance on overlapping users and alleviating data sparsity in the target domain. D2TCDR first proposes a domain disentanglement module to extract the domain-invariant representations, capturing shared preferences across domains by eliminating domain-specific interference. Subsequently, a guided diffusion model is designed to model the domain-level distribution of these domain-invariant representations. By injecting target-domain signals into the guided diffusion model, we further steer the learned distribution toward the target domain, achieving knowledge transfer without relying on overlapping users. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain datasets show the superior performance of D2TCDR, validating its recommendation capabilities in complex transfer scenarios 1 .",

    "Abstract": "Timing convergence is paramount for the feasibility of VLSI circuit design, which is highly dependent on timing optimization during VLSI placement. Timing-driven placement usually achieves timing optimization by optimizing the locations of timing-violating cells. These cells are often characterized by timing criticality in global and detailed placement. However, we find that this metric cannot accurately capture the cells whose movement will affect the overall timing results. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a timing sensitivity analysis framework to precisely quantify the impact of physical objects (pins, combinational cells, FFs, and nets) on overall timing. Within this framework, we derive the TNS and WNS sensitivities of pins, combinational cells, FFs and nets. Moreover, we introduce a total timing sensitivity metric to estimate how much physical objects affect the total timing. To validate its effectiveness, the timing sensitivity analysis framework is utilized to refine the combinational cell movement techniques in Rsyn [6, 7]. Moreover, we develop an FF classification and moving scheme based on the timing sensitivity analysis framework, to further enhance timing optimization. Experimental results show that our approach achieves remarkable average improvements in TNS and WNS without compromising total wirelength and routability, compared to the state-of-the-art timing-driven detailed placer.",

    "Abstract": "Plant proteins can meet dietary needs when properly combined, but individuals who avoid legumes, tofu, or tempeh may struggle to maintain adequate protein intake. Some may turn to ultraprocessed foods, reducing their intake of fiber-rich, micronutrient-dense protein sources and increasing exposure to additives and processing-derived contaminants. These factors can disrupt the nutritional exposome, referring to the totality of dietary exposure that an individual faces throughout life. To evaluate whether the food industry addresses these issues, we analyzed the nutrition labels of 240 protein-fortified bread and pasta products from 29 countries across diverse geographic regions. Although protein fortification can improve amino acid balance, increase dietary fiber, lower glycemic response, and increase satiety, its potential is limited by the excessive reliance on functional but lysine-poor gluten, the presence of antinutritional factors, and technological, economic, or cultural barriers to incorporating more diverse plant-protein sources. Strategic ingredient blending, precision processing, and AI-assisted formulation tools are new tools poised to help produce nutritionally balanced, safe, and sustainable cereal products aligned with plant-forward diets.",

    "Abstract": "The integration of a versatile reference electrode into multi-layered pouch cells enables impedance deconvolution in lithium-ion batteries. This reference electrode facilitates isolation of impedance contributions from the cathode, anode, and full cell across a range of states of charge. The reference electrode design minimizes artefacts commonly associated with three-electrode configurations, allowing for clean impedance measurements. Fourier transform techniques were applied to reconstruct HPPC voltage responses, confirming consistency between frequency-domain and time-domain characterizations. These findings demonstrate that 3-electrode EIS with this versatile reference electrode captures transient voltage behavior at various timescales, supporting diagnostics, model calibration, and battery health monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "Current clinical guidelines recommend withholding renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitors during acute kidney injury (AKI) due to concerns over impaired glomerular perfusion. However, their potential to mitigate post-AKI inflammation and fibrosis remains unexplored. We hypothesized that telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) with reported PPAR-γ activity, would enhance recovery from ischemic AKI. Male Wistar rats were subjected to unilateral nephrectomy and 45-minute ischemia in the contralateral kidney, or sham surgery. Animals were randomized to receive telmisartan (3 mg/kg/day) or placebo for 10 days, starting one week before injury. Telmisartan treatment significantly accelerated the recovery of renal function and attenuated tubular necrosis, inflammation, and the expression of injury biomarkers. At the whole‑kidney tissue level at 72 h post‑IRI, bulk RNA‑sequencing compared to healthy control mice without IRI revealed apparent broad metabolic dysfunction, with suppression of fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial pathways, which may reflect both injury‑driven changes in cellular composition and transcriptional regulation within surviving cells. These transcriptomic findings 72 h after IRI were significantly blunted or even abolished by telmisartan. This treatment effects did not show evidence of direct PPAR-γ pathway activation, This study suggests that the metabolic modulatory effects of certain angiotensin II receptor blockers may provide therapeutic benefit during the recovery phase of AKI, independent of direct PPAR-γ signaling.",

    "Abstract": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition influenced by genetic, environmental, and sex-related factors. Women experience greater asthma severity, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and inflammation than men, likely due to sex-linked genetic and hormonal differences. However, the independent contributions of sex chromosomes and gonadal sex to these responses remain unclear. This study examines their roles in allergic airway responses using the Four Core Genotype (FCG) mouse model, which distinguishes between chromosomal and gonadal influences. We hypothesized that XX-mice and those with female gonads would exhibit heightened airway inflammation and immune activation in response to house dust mite (HDM) challenge. Using a controlled, moderate five-week HDM exposure paradigm that reliably induced allergic airway inflammation, we aimed to capture biologically relevant sex- and genotype-dependent variations rather than a maximal inflammatory phenotype. FCG mice (XXF, XXM, XYF, XYM) underwent 5 weeks of HDM exposure, followed by assessments of airway lung function and inflammation. Our results showed that HDM challenge differentially increased airway resistance and elastance in FCG mice, with specific contributions of sex chromosomes and gonadal sex. Histological analysis showed higher lung inflammation and goblet cell hyperplasia in challenged mice with female gonads than those with male gonads. Flow cytometry assessment revealed elevated eosinophils in XXF mice. Combined, our findings show that both sex chromosomes and gonadal sex influence airway inflammation and immune responses to allergen challenge, with mice bearing XX chromosomes and female gonads exhibiting greater susceptibility.",

    "Abstract": "Despite the evidence that responses to intermittent hypoxia (IH) vary between sexes, potentially underlying sex-specific comorbidities of sleep apnea, the roles that sex hormones play during exposure to IH in rodent models remain poorly defined. The Estradiol receptor ɑ (ERɑ), expressed in structures of the peripheral and central nervous system, contributes to autonomic regulations and control of arterial blood pressure, accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that ERα modulates respiratory and heart rate variability in male and female mice exposed to IH. We used adult wild-type (WT) and ERα knockout (ERαKO) mice of both sexes for whole-body plethysmography, arterial blood pressure and ECG recordings before and after 14 days of IH (6% O₂, 12 cycles/h, 12 h/day). Compared to males, WT females exhibited greater respiratory variability and higher apnea frequency before IH exposure. In females, ERα deletion increased body weight, and reduced post-sigh apnea frequency before IH exposure. In ANCOVA/GLM models, body weight was a significant negative covariate for post-sigh and spontaneous apneas before IH exposure, while sex and genotype effects were not significant after adjustment. IH exposure increased the mean and diastolic blood pressures only in WT males. IH also increased apneas frequency in WT females, an effect markedly reduced by ERɑ deletion. Similarly, heart rate variability increased in WT females following IH, reflecting enhanced parasympathetic modulation, an effect absent in ERαKO females and in WT or ERαKO males. We conclude that in female mice, deletion of ERα prevents IH-induced improvement of heart rate variability.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose: Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) is an aggressive subtype of soft tissue sarcoma with poor outcomes, particularly in metastatic cases. The mechanisms driving metastasis in UPS remain poorly understood, limiting therapeutic advances. Experimental Design: A multi-omics approach was employed to analyze paired primary and metastatic UPS tumor samples. Spatial transcriptomics, bulk RNA sequencing, and deconvolution analyses were performed to identify molecular pathways and immune microenvironment alterations associated with metastasis. Functional assays using CRISPR-Cas9 knockout UPS cell lines, alongside in vivo models, were used for functional validation experiments. Results: Transcriptomic analyses on 13 UPS patients revealed significant upregulation of hypoxia, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and immune-suppressive pathways in metastatic UPS. ADORA2B was identified as a key driver of these processes, with elevated expression correlating with poor disease-free survival in UPS patients. Functional studies confirmed that ADORA2B promotes proliferation, migration, invasion, and matrix remodeling via metalloprotease regulation. In vivo, ADORA2B knockout reduced primary tumor growth and metastatic dissemination in UPS models. Conclusions: This study identifies ADORA2B as a critical regulator of metastatic progression in UPS, implicating it as a promising therapeutic target. Ongoing clinical trials targeting adenosine pathways further support the translational potential of ADORA2B inhibition to disrupt metastasis and improve outcomes for UPS patients.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Oncogenic RAS drives an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Inhibition of RAS signaling, as is now possible with an ever-increasing pharmaceutical portfolio, not only directly blocks tumors cells but also reverses immunosuppression, enabling infiltration of cytotoxic T cells and major alteration of the tumor microenvironment. In preclinical studies, the full anti-tumor effects of RAS inhibitors depend on T cells such that regressions in mice lacking T cells (or cross-presenting dendritic cells) are less deep and less durable than those in T cell-replete mice. Moreover, RAS inhibitors given with immune checkpoint blockade and immune agonists produce even more potent anti-tumor effects, especially in tumors with some amount of baseline T cell infiltration. These findings set the stage for testing RAS inhibitors and immunotherapy in combination for pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDAC), which is otherwise refractory to immunotherapy. Other immune partners might include vaccines, bispecific antibodies, and cell therapy. A major clinical opportunity eventually would be combining RAS inhibitors and immunotherapy in the adjuvant, neo-adjuvant, and interception settings, provided this new class of drugs is developed keeping its immune modulatory power in mind.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Lymphedema is a chronic complication of breast cancer treatment, and early intervention is crucial to reduce morbidity. This study evaluated the role of blood-based cytokine biomarkers in the prognostication of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) to improve risk prediction. A secondary analysis of inflammatory biomarkers for BCRL was performed using a previously published cohort of 147 breast cancer patients who had undergone serum cytokine profiling during their treatment at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre from 2010-2014. Prognostic cytokine variables for lymphedema were selected by regression analysis and independence from known clinical risk factors. Regression-based modeling was employed to integrate prognostic variables for the prediction of lymphedema occurrence. We identified the immunostimulatory cytokine IFN-α2A as a potential biomarker for lymphedema development (OR 3.10, 95% CI 1.05-9.51, p=0.042), independent from known clinical risk factors. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated 3-year lymphedema-free survival of 95% (90-100%) vs. 85% (77-94%) for below vs. above median concentrations of IFN-α2A (p=0.026). In combination with an established clinical risk regression-based model, patients identified as high risk based on clinical factors alone were able to be correctly reclassified as low risk by IFN-α2A in 31% (8/26) of cases. Our combined logistic regression model using both IFN-α2A and clinical risk score achieved an AUC of 0.895 (95% CI: 0.796 - 0.971) and Brier Score of 0.101 (95% CI: 0.061 - 0.149), representing a favourable improvement compared to the logistic regression model using clinical risk factors alone. IFN-α2A in combination with established clinical risk factors may be useful for improving BCRL prognostication.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The GFR-Ex study assessed the feasibility of a 12-month exercise training program to attenuate the rate of decline in isotope-measured (mGFR) and estimated (eGFR) Glomerular Filtration Rate. Methods: In a multicentre feasibility study, people with stage 3-4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) with declining function were randomized to 12 months exercise training (home-based aerobic and resistance program) or control (usual care). Feasibility was assessed by recruitment and retention rates, intervention adherence, and harms. Differences in mGFR between groups at 12 months and between mGFR and eGFR were calculated. Qualitative interviews were used to explore participant experiences. Results: 2,260 patients were screened; 74 participants were randomized (mean age (SD): 56(14) years; eGFR: 34(13)ml/min/1.73m2; 62% male; 61% white); and 34 completed the study (11 exercise; 23 control). The screening eligibility rate was 11%; consent rate was 48%; 12-month retention rate was 43%; and the median [IQR] exercise sessions completed was 69 [63, 72]%. No exercise-related harms were recorded. The mean mGFR at 12 months was 36.1 (exercise) vs. 33.8 (control); eGFR minus mGFR was -1.6 (95% Cl:-2.6, -0.6) ml/min/1.73m2. Qualitative interviews identified the importance of peer and professional support for patient engagement and a high level of patient commitment being required for the research procedures. Conclusion: In people with progressive CKD, a 12-month exercise training program was safe and feasible. Exercise tended to attenuate GFR decline, and eGFR agreed well with mGFR. Progression to a definitive trial is warranted, provided modifications are made, including providing patient support and selection of eGFR as the primary outcome.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aim: The efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) treatment in alleviating visceral hypersensitivity with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has been established. Abnormal bile acid metabolism and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) expression are recognized as potential contributors to visceral hypersensitivity in IBS. This study as a preclinical study of the IBS visceral hypersensitivity, explored the potential of EA to reduce visceral hypersensitivity in rats with IBS by improving bile acid metabolism and FXR expression. Methods：Heterotypic intermittent stress (HIS) for 9 days was used to induce visceral hypersensitivity in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C). EA/Sham EA bilateral ST36 and LR3 acupoints began on the 5th day of HIS. Electromyography of the abdominal external oblique muscle and calcitonin gene-related peptide were used to assess colonic hypersensitivity. Colonoscopy and histopathological examination were used to evaluate pathological changes in the colon. Bile acid composition was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), while FXR expression in colon tissue was quantified through immunofluorescence and Western blot. Results: HIS induced visceral hypersensitivity in IBS-C rats. EA not only regulated bile acid levels in the feces of IBS-C rats, but it also had a downregulatory effect on the overexpression of FXR in the colon tissue of rats with IBS-C. The therapeutic effects were better than those of the sham EA. EA treatment alleviated visceral hypersensitivity in the colon of IBS-C rats. Conclusion: Our data suggested that EA normalised colonic bile-acid signaling and FXR protein expression in an IBS-C rat model, offering a mechanistic hypothesis for future clinical evaluation.

    "Abstract": "Background: Growing evidence shows that the relationship between cancer and cardiovascular disease is not unidirectional. The recognized impact of cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease on cancer risk has led to the coining of the term reverse cardio-oncology Summary: Cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and obesity are involved in several pathophysiologic mechanisms which also underlie cancer development and progression. These mechanisms include inflammation, oxidative stress, and DNA damage. In addition, cardiovascular diseases such as atrial fibrillation, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and heart failure by causing an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system and neurohormonal system function, through the activation of tumorigenesis processes may facilitate cancer development. Epidemiological studies, which show an increased incidence and a faster progression of cancer in patients with concurrent cardiovascular disease, support the existence of an association between these two sets of diseases. Key Messages. Several biological pathways underlying cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular diseases are also involved in cancer development and progression. Reverse cardio-oncology has the potential to become the foundation for integrated healthcare strategies aimed at reducing global disease burden.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Primary fourth ventricle outlet obstruction (PFVOO) is a rare cause of obstructive hydrocephalus in children. Diagnosis often requires high clinical suspicion and advanced MRI sequences, and the optimal management remains a matter of debate. Case Presentation: We report a 3-year-old girl with unexplained tetraventricular hydrocephalus who presented with progressive macrocephaly, intermittent headaches, and atypical stereotyped head movements. She had previously undergone ventriculoperitoneal shunting in infancy, which failed after 18 months. High-resolution 3D-CISS MRI confirmed a patent aqueduct and a membranous obstruction at the foramen of Magendie, establishing the diagnosis of idiopathic PFVOO. An endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) was performed uneventfully, and postoperative MRI confirmed ventricular size reduction. The patient remains clinically stable two years later, representing one of the longest pediatric follow-ups reported after ETV for PFVOO. Conclusion: PFVOO should be included in the differential diagnosis of unexplained tetraventricular hydrocephalus in children when conventional imaging is inconclusive. Advanced MRI sequences such as 3D-CISS are valuable for identifying subtle outlet obstructions. This case, extending the pediatric follow-up to two years, reinforces ETV as a safe and durable first-line treatment option in selected patients with PFVOO.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Beyond its medical manifestations, people living with epilepsy face barriers to healthcare access and high levels of stigma. Educational interventions have been shown to improve knowledge and reduce stigma, particularly when adapted to diverse social and cultural contexts. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of an educational comic book on knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding epilepsy among adolescents in Quito, Ecuador. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted among students from urban and rural schools in Quito. Data were collected using a structured KAP questionnaire administered before and after the intervention. Changes in global and subscale KAP scores were analyzed, and logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with greater improvement of the score. Results: A total of 344 students participated (mean age: 13.8 years; 52.9% male). The median global KAP score increased significantly from 11.5 (IQR: 8.8–13.7) before, to 15.1 (IQR: 13.2–16.4) after the intervention (p &lt; 0.001). A very large majority of students showed significant improvement of the score regardless of baseline level, with the greatest gains observed among those with initially lower scores. Students who had previously witnessed an epileptic seizure were less likely to achieve a high improvement on the score (OR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.24–0.68; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The educational comic book improved adolescents’ knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to epilepsy in both urban and rural schools in Quito. Comic books were therefore very effective, regardless of socio-demographic characteristics, highlighting the value of culturally adapted narrative tools in strengthening epilepsy education to help reduce stigma.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Children with speech sound disorders (SSDs) often display heterogeneous underlying processing profiles that are not fully captured by conventional articulation assessments. To address this limitation, this study developed a computerized Speech Processing Task (SPT) system designed to evaluate multiple psycholinguistic processing stages such as speech perception, phonological awareness, representation, and motor programming. Methods: The SPT system was designed based on a psycholinguistic speech processing model and included ten subtasks: Discrimination Task (DT), Input Phonological Awareness Task (IPAT), Phonological Representation Task (PRT), Output Phonological Awareness Task (OPAT), and Nonword Repetition Task (NRT), administered in both Korean (L1) and English (L2). The system was computerized to facilitate automated scoring and analysis. Study 1 focused on item development and system implementation. Study 2 evaluated the content validity and internal consistency of the system using expert panel review and Cronbach’s α. Study 3 applied the SPT to typically developing children to examine their performance by task type and language. Results: All subtasks demonstrated satisfactory content validity (CVR &gt; 0.80, CVI &gt; 0.90) and high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.779–0.912). A repeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant main effects of language and task type, as well as a significant interaction between the two. Overall, participants showed higher performance on Korean tasks than on English tasks, with the exception of the DT. Among the subtasks, performance on the IPAT and NRT was relatively lower than on the other tasks. Conclusion: The SPT system showed strong validity and reliability, effectively capturing language and task-related differences in speech processing. By enabling parallel assessment in Korean and English, it offers a useful framework for profiling individual processing abilities and has potential applications in both research and clinical settings.",

    "Abstract": "We reanalyzed data from Sobrero et al. (2016) to measure dorsal dentate gyrus (dDG) folding or gyrification in Octodon degus and O. lunatus as a morphological proxy for neurogenesis and macrostructural plasticity in hippocampal or extracortical regions. Using Zilles’ (ZGI) and Vogeley’s (VGI) indices, we quantified dDG gyrification across hemispheres in populations differing in habitat complexity and social behaviour. Left dDG gyrification (ZGIL) showed a preliminary association with social group size, while right dDG gyrification (VGIR) was predicted by population differences. Octodon lunatus from shrub-dense environments exhibited greater dDG folding than O. degus from open habitats, supporting an influence of habitat conditions in shaping hippocampal morphology. Although not statistically significant, hemispheric asymmetries were suggested, a trend consistent with previously reported right-lateralized DG cell numbers in O. lunatus and habitat–sociality effects on DG cell counts in O. degus from El Salitre. Overall, our results support dDG gyrification as an informative marker of neural plasticity shaped by habitat conditions, emphasizing the importance of wild models in brain–ecology research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Emerging evidence highlights the gut microbiota as a key contributor to the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), acting through complex interactions with intestinal motility, immune function, epithelial barrier integrity, and the gut-brain axis. This narrative review summarizes current knowledge regarding the roles of the gut microbiota and their metabolites in IBS. Summary: We discuss alterations in the gut microbiota in IBS, with particular emphasis on changes in short-chain fatty acid production, bile acid metabolism, serotonin signaling, and gas handling. Special attention is given to microbial metabolites as mediators of visceral hypersensitivity, intestinal permeability, and neuromodulation within the microbiota–gut–brain axis. Major alterations in the gut microbiota of IBS are characterized by a reduction in Bacteroidetes, Bifidobacteria, and Faecalibacterium, accompanied by an increase in Firmicutes. We explain the importance of butyrate metabolism in colonic epithelial cells for maintaining the anaerobic environment of the gut. In addition, we review the impact of diet-microbiota interactions, including FODMAP restriction, resistant starch intake, and protein fermentation, on symptom generation and microbial stability. Key message: Although accumulating evidence supports a link between gut dysbiosis and IBS, establishing causal relationships remains challenging due to disease heterogeneity and dietary influences. Future large-scale, well-phenotyped, multi-omics studies integrating microbiota, metabolomic, and host factors are required to elucidate underlying mechanisms and to guide personalized therapeutic strategies for IBS.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is associated with accelerated vascular complications such as hypertension and atherosclerosis. Phenotypic switching of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), a major driver of these complications, is enhanced in diabetes. Despite adequate glycemic control, SMC dysfunction can persist due to metabolic memory of prior hyperglycemia. However, the mechanisms are unclear. Here, leveraging single-cell multiomics, we examined the effect of glucose normalization on transcriptomic and epigenomic changes associated with SMC phenotypic transition in type 2 diabetes mice. METHODS: Type 2 diabetes db/db mice were treated with the antidiabetic drug dapagliflozin (DAPA) or vehicle and nondiabetic control db/+ mice with vehicle for 6 weeks. Dissected aortas were subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing, single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics (Xenium) to determine single-cell changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. RESULTS: DAPA conferred effective glycemic control in db/db mice, with significant reductions in blood glucose and hemoglobinA1c. scRNA and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing analysis of aortas identified SMC, fibroblasts, endothelial, and immune cells. SMCs were further clustered into 9 subtypes, including contractile and fibromyocyte-like cells. Interestingly, SMC contractile phenotype–associated pathways decreased in diabetes and remained decreased despite DAPA treatment. Fibrosis and inflammation-associated pathways in SMC and fibroblasts, and dysfunction markers in endothelial cells, increased in diabetes and were partly reversed by DAPA. Pseudotime trajectory analysis of SMC revealed increased activities of fibromyocyte-enriched TFs (transcription factors) during the contractile to fibromyocyte transition. Pairwise analysis for differentially accessible regions revealed diabetes-associated differentially accessible regions, enrichment of TF motifs, and related disease-associated biological processes. However, no differentially accessible regions were identified between db/db and db/dbDAPA groups. Spatial transcriptomics mapped aortic cell types within intact aortas and validated sc-seq data. CONCLUSIONS: Type 2 diabetes induces gene expression and chromatin accessibility changes associated with profound SMC phenotypic switching. These changes are not efficiently reversed by a widely used antidiabetic drug, DAPA, underscoring the need for more effective therapies targeting hyperglycemic memory.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic therapy with SGLT2i (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors) is associated with long-term reno-protective benefits. There are limited data on the benefits of these agents against the risk of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (CA-AKI). METHODS: The retrospective study population included all patients with diabetes enrolled in the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan Cardiovascular Consortium Percutaneous Coronary Intervention registry, a clinical registry of all PCI cases at nonfederal hospitals in the state of Michigan. Included patients underwent PCI between January 2022 and September 2023. Patients on dialysis and those without post-PCI serum creatinine measurements were excluded. SGLT2i users were compared with nonusers with respect to CA-AKI outcomes, defined as an increase in serum creatinine of ≥0.5 mg/dL following PCI. Outcomes were evaluated in a risk-adjusted, propensity-matched analysis. RESULTS: Among 13 804 patients with diabetes who underwent PCI, CA-AKI occurred in 3.8% (82/2186) of SGLT2i users versus 5.2% (602/11 618) of nonusers (odds ratio, 0.71; P =0.004). In propensity-matched, risk-adjusted analysis, the pre-PCI use of SGLT2i correlated with a lower incidence of CA-AKI (3.69% versus 4.68%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.72; P =0.027). The protective effect of SGLT2i was preserved among higher-risk subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with diabetes who underwent PCI, preprocedural use of SGLT2i correlated with a lower risk of CA-AKI.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect is a rare and complex congenital heart disease. In cases where pulmonary blood flow is supplied exclusively by major aortopulmonary collateral arteries, traditional surgical interventions may be challenging or delayed, especially in resource-limited settings. This study evaluated the feasibility, safety, and outcomes of the right ventricular outflow tract perforation through the retrograde trans-collateral approach in patients with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries dependent pulmonary circulation. METHODS: The study cohort comprised 10 patients with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect who underwent attempted retrograde trans-collateral right ventricular outflow tract perforation via major aortopulmonary collateral arteries from October 2021 to February 2025, including 1 unsuccessful procedure. RESULTS: The median age at intervention was 4.1 years, and the median weight was 17 kg. Post-procedure, systemic oxygen saturation increased significantly ( P &lt;0.01). Follow-up imaging demonstrated substantial growth of the pulmonary arteries following retrograde trans-collateral right ventricular outflow tract recanalization, with significant improvements in both right and left pulmonary artery Z scores ( P &lt;0.01) and a significant increase in the Nakata index from a median of 49 to 111.7 mm 2 /m 2 ( P &lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Retrograde trans-collateral right ventricular outflow tract perforation is a feasible and safe catheter-based strategy for selected patients with pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, promoting central pulmonary artery growth and serving as a bridge to future surgical repair.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postprandial hypotension (PPH) may contribute to falls among older adults, particularly those taking antihypertensive medication. However, evidence on this association in community-dwelling populations is limited. Since ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring captures BP during daily activities, it may provide accurate assessments of PPH outside the clinic setting. METHODS: This prospective cohort study examined the association between PPH and fall risk among community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 years taking antihypertensive medication. At baseline, participants underwent 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring; subsequently, they completed monthly fall calendars during a 12-month follow-up. PPH by systolic BP (SBP; systolic PPH) was defined as a postprandial SBP decline, mean SBP during the hour before the meal minus the minimum SBP during the 2 hours after the meal, following any meal of ≥20 mm Hg, or a decrease to SBP ≤90 mm Hg when preprandial SBP was ≥100 mm Hg. RESULTS: Among 626 participants (mean±SD age, 74.6±6.2 years; 56.1% women), 442 (70.6%) experienced systolic PPH. The mean±SD number of meals was 2.6±0.8 during the ambulatory BP monitoring period. During the 12-month follow-up, falls occurred in 169 of 442 (38.2%) participants with systolic PPH and 70 of 184 (38.0%) participants without systolic PPH. Systolic PPH was not associated with fall risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.69–1.26]). A restricted cubic spline analysis demonstrated no evidence of an association between the largest postprandial SBP decline across all meals and fall risk. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort study, PPH identified by ambulatory BP monitoring was common but not associated with risk of falls.",

It is motivated by growing concerns in recent policy discussions regarding the country's underutilized growth potential, which could be unlocked through more effective integration into GMVCs. Indonesia initially had promising prospects for export-oriented industrialization by engaging in GMVCs. However, its industrialization trajectory over subsequent years has not lived up to expectations. Strong evidence indicates that Indonesia's deep-rooted policy ambivalence has hindered its full participation in global production networks. The findings highlight the need for a proactive investment promotion strategy to attract multinational enterprises involved in GMVCs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract U.S. colleges face persistent inequities—not only in who enrolls, but in who ultimately graduates. While institutions have expanded efforts to diversify incoming classes, students from historically underserved backgrounds, including those who are first-generation and economically disadvantaged, continue to face several barriers which affect their rate of degree completion. This paper evaluates the causal impact of the a bridge program called BSP, an eight-week pre-collegiate summer initiative at a large public land grant university designed to support such students in their transition to college. Leveraging a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (FRDD) within a local randomization inference framework, I find that BSP substantially improves first-year completion and second-year persistence. While participants receive a $2,500 annual scholarship, comparative analyses of similar financial aid programs suggest that the bundled nature of BSP—including structured summer programming, academic mentoring, and peer support—is central to its effectiveness. These findings underscore the importance of holistic interventions that address both financial and non-financial barriers to student success.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Decisions are often thought of as an intermediary between perception and action, but the degree to which this assumption is integrated into different parts of cognitive neuroscience theory and practice varies. After examining these variations on the causal relationship between decisions and actions, this perspective will argue for the claim that decisions and decision processes do not cause actions. An argument will be made that, in place of decision processes, actions are caused by sensorimotor processes. Lastly, ideas are given for studying the sensorimotor processes involved in decisions and actions. The main recommendation is a move to more ecological testing environments that give participants agency over their actions and allow them to learn by continuously updating sensorimotor processes through active sensing.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Adaptive behavior is central to coping with dynamic environmental changes. Although functional neuroanatomical and neurophysiological considerations suggest that information must be exchanged during adaptive behavior and similar predictions can be derived from cognitive science concepts, attempts to delineate the directed information transfer in theta and alpha networks during behavioral adaptation are rare. Using task switching as an experimental vehicle, we examined directed communication in theta and alpha band networks in n = 51 healthy individuals. We combined EEG-beamforming with an artificial neural network-based estimation of linear and nonlinear directed information transfer between cortical regions. We show increased theta and alpha band activities during switch trials, which aligns with the cognitive control demands of task switching. EEG-beamforming indicated oscillatory modulations in distinct brain-wide networks depending on frequency and time window, with theta and alpha activities strongly tied to task-set reconfiguration and inhibitory control. Directed connectivity analysis revealed overlapping alpha and theta clusters, highlighting their interplay in cognitive flexibility. Directed communication in a cortical alpha band network involving fronto-temporal, temporoparietal, occipital, and precentral activity clusters was critical when preparing for task switching. We observed a bidirectional information transfer across four neuroanatomical clusters with more substantial connectivity modulations correlating with better task performance. These findings emphasize the importance of directed information transfer in a cortical alpha band activity network in supporting adaptive behavior.",

    "Abstract": "Ceramides are essential skin lipids for maintaining the mammalian skin permeability barrier, which protects against external stimuli. The precursor of epidermal ceramides, glucosylceramides (GlcCer), is synthesized within granular keratinocytes while its precise cellular transport mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Here, we identified three pathogenic variants in the GLTP gene, which encodes glycolipid transfer protein, in five unrelated families with nonsyndromic epidermal differentiation disorder presenting with generalized skin scaling. The biallelic GLTP variants resulted in loss of competent GLTP expression. CRISPR/Cas9-generated Gltp knockout mice exhibited lethal barrier defects, partially recapitulating the clinical features of our patients. We demonstrated that GLTP facilitated GlcCer transport in differentiated keratinocytes, with its deficiency causing impaired GlcCer trafficking and consequent aberrant retention in lysosomes, thereby disrupted lysosome function. The lysosomal dysfunction impaired autophagy flux, resulting in delayed keratinocyte terminal differentiation, which is expected to compromise the skin barrier integrity and ultimate abnormal scaling. Pharmaceutical inhibition of GlcCer synthesis effectively rescued both autophagy and keratinocyte differentiation defects. Our findings establish GLTP as a novel underlying gene for nonsyndromic epidermal differentiation disorders and unravel its essential role in maintaining skin homeostasis during terminal differentiation by mediating epidermal GlcCer transport.",

    "Abstract": "This study was conducted to determine phubbing, public speaking anxiety, and the need for social approval among young adults. This study was conducted using a cross-sectional design. The study was completed with 1,063 young adults aged 18-26 from various cities in Turkey. Data were collected using a personal information form, the General Phubbing Scale, the Public Speaking Anxiety Scale, and the Need for Social Approval Scale. Multiple linear regression analysis and linear regression analysis were used to analyse the data. According to the results of multiple linear regression analysis, the model explains 39.5% of the variance in public speaking anxiety and is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). It has been determined that the level of phubbing is positively and significantly related to public speaking anxiety and the need for social approval. An increase in phubbing scores is associated with an increase in public speaking anxiety and social approval need scores. Furthermore, phubbing explains 14.1% of the variance in social approval need and significantly predicts this variable (p &lt; 0.001). This study demonstrates that phubbing behaviour in young adults is associated with public speaking anxiety and the need for social approval. An increase in phubbing negatively impacts both variables. The findings indicate that a decrease in face-to-face communication may have significant effects on the psychological well-being of young adults. Accordingly, it is recommended that young adults engage in social activities and receive information aimed at reducing phubbing.",

Drawing on archival materials, it investigates how colonial officials and plantation owners viewed hill communities, particularly the Dhangars, as submissive, diligent, and suitable for indentured labor due to their socio-economic disenfranchisement and perceived cultural simplicity. Additionally, it delves into the challenges faced by hill coolies, such as poor working conditions, cultural dislocation, and high mortality rates, especially during sea voyages. It highlights how these factors, alongside evolving economic strategies and the need for greater social control, led to a shift in preference toward plain laborers. Positioned within the broader frameworks of global capitalism, the transformation of slavery and colonial oppression, this work underscores the resilience and agency of displaced communities in the face of systemic exploitation. By revealing the entrenched structural inequalities perpetuated by the indentured labor system, it offers critical insights into the socio-economic and political dynamics that influenced migration, labor policies, and the lived experiences of hill coolies in the colonial era.",

    "Abstract": "This paper investigates a dynamic output feedback adaptive integral sliding mode predictive control (AISMPC) approach based on a dual-loop Kalman filter (DLKF) for linear discrete-time systems. The considered system class is subjected to bounded disturbances and noise, with constraints on both the inputs and states. The DLKF introduces one loop to estimate the states and another loop to estimate the disturbances. The dynamic output feedback AISMPC consists of two parts: one component is an output feedback adaptive integral sliding mode control (AISMC) to handle disturbances, and the other component is an output feedback robust model predictive control (RMPC) to achieve optimal control with constraints. It is proved that the closed-loop system is stabilized in a neighborhood of the origin. Finally, numerical simulation tests are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose of the Review: Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a novel neurostimulation method that merges the benefits of controlled seizure induction with the targeted application and enhances the safety of magnetic stimulation. This article reviews current research and assesses the potential role of MST in the management of mood disorders. Collection and Analysis of Data: We searched PubMed and Google Scholar for English-language articles on MST in mood disorders. We also searched for articles comparing MST with electroconvulsive therapy. Early clinical studies and preclinical studies suggest that MST may be effective in alleviating both manic and depressive symptoms, with a more favorable cognitive profile. However, evidence remains preliminary, with limited randomized controlled trials and comprehensive long-term follow-up data. Conclusion: Although MST appears promising as an innovative treatment option, additional large-scale, rigorously controlled studies are needed to confirm its safety, effectiveness, and ideal therapeutic approaches for individuals with mood disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a high-risk, low-frequency intervention requiring specialized training and effective teamwork, for which simulation-based training is a valuable tool. Across medical disciplines escape room-style simulations have been developed to enhance teamwork and engagement among learners. Methods We conducted a prospective observational study at a large academic medical center to evaluate the feasibility and educational impact of an escape room–style ECMO simulation. Thirty-seven nurses completed the escape room simulation. Teamwork was assessed with the Clinical Teamwork Scale (CTS), and effectiveness with the Simulation Effectiveness Tool (SET-M). Results Observer-rated CTS scores for overall teamwork (r = −0.76), communication (r = −0.52), and decision-making (r = −0.55) correlated negatively with completion time, suggesting that stronger teamwork was associated with greater efficiency. Participant self-ratings were significantly higher than observer ratings across most domains ( p &lt; 0.01), and showed positive correlations with completion times. SET-M results indicated high satisfaction, with all participants reporting improved ECMO knowledge and skills, though prebriefing and debriefing received lower ratings. Conclusions These findings support escape room–style simulations as a feasible and engaging approach to ECMO education, with external observation playing a key role in assessing teamwork. Future studies should focus on structured briefing, randomized team assignments, and multidisciplinary cohorts to enhance generalizability and learning outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Runway safety in landing and takeoff operations is strongly influenced by skid resistance, which may be reduced by rubber buildup from aircraft braking. Conventional friction measurement methods require specialized equipment and operational interruptions, limiting their frequency and increasing costs. This study explores the use of satellite imagery and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a non-intrusive and cost-effective alternative for classifying runway friction coefficients. A dataset of about 7,000 Google Earth images of Brazilian aerodrome runways was matched with measured friction coefficients. Three preprocessing techniques (contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization [CLAHE], Gaussian filter, and wavelet) and five CNN architectures (simple CNN, ResNet50, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and VGG16) were evaluated. The best performance was obtained with CLAHE + Gaussian preprocessing and DenseNet121, achieving over 74% accuracy in cross-validation. External validation with unseen satellite images confirmed robustness, while tests with unmanned aerial vehicle imagery showed limited generalization across visual domains. The results indicate that deep learning combined with remote sensing can support airport pavement management. The proposed approach complements direct friction monitoring, offering a scalable, low-cost, and non-intrusive tool to identify critical areas, guide preventive maintenance, and enhance operational safety.",

    "Abstract": "People are usually not aware of returning their unused or expired medicines or not ready to practice pharmaceutical waste management (PWM) safely. The present research aimed to explore Malaysians’ awareness, readiness and practice (ARP) on safe and sustainable PWM. The research was conducted from April 2023 to April 2024 among 318 randomly selected people having unused or expired medicines. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with a semi-structured questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis was performed sequentially among ARP domains. Reliability of research instrument was checked with Cronbach’s alpha. Correlation among ARP scores was analysed with Pearson’s correlation, and generalized linear model was performed to analyse statistical relationships of outcome variables with various predictors. Data were analysed in SPSS 29.0 considering p -value &lt;0.05 statistically significant at 95% confidence interval. A total of 112 (35.2%) respondents had good awareness, but 176 (55.3%) had sub-optimum readiness and 130 (40.9%) had sub-optimum practice level in terms of safe and sustainable PWM. Though there were positive and significant correlations ( p &lt; 0.001 in all) between awareness and readiness ( r = 0.339), readiness and practice ( r = 0.414) and awareness and practice ( r = 0.420), their strengths were small. It means the aware people may also not be ready to practice safely. Hence, policymakers should encourage people’s participation in managing pharmaceutical wastes effectively. The present research has implications on Sustainable Development Goal 12, that is, rational consumption and production by its exploration of people’s ARP constructs on safe and sustainable PWM.",

Although mood and behavioral symptoms are described in this group, it's unclear whether these meet diagnostic criteria. We investigated the occurrence of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in a nationally representative sample, using a semistructured psychiatric interview, as well as the use of psychotropic medication. Ten of 20 individuals met the criteria for one or more current diagnoses, with an additional 5 having past diagnoses, resulting in a lifetime occurrence in 15 individuals. Anxiety disorders were the most frequent diagnostic group, followed by neurodevelopmental disorders. Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was the most common single diagnosis. Subthreshold psychiatric symptoms were present in all individuals. Although psychiatric disorders were frequent, few used psychotropic medication. These findings underscore the need for routine monitoring of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in individuals with CLN3 and the provision of evidence-based treatments.",

    "Abstract": "Background The Parkinson's Image Self (PIS) Report app was developed to complement standard clinician-rated assessments, such as the Movement Disorder Society–Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), by enabling patients to digitally self-report Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms, including pain, tremor, rigidity, and emotional states. Objective To evaluate PIS Report validity and digital health utility by comparing patient-reported outcomes with clinician-rated MDS-UPDRS assessments. Methods Seventy-eight PD participants completed baseline assessments; 70 provided week-8 follow-up data. PIS outcomes were compared with MDS-UPDRS items using ANOVA, correlation analysis, chi-square tests, and Cohen's kappa statistics. Results PIS-derived pain scores differed significantly across MDS-UPDRS pain strata (Item 1.9; F = 4.48, p &lt; 0.01). Head/neck and upper limb pain correlated with perceived OFF periods (r = 0.46–0.48, p &lt; 0.001), while head/neck and lower limb pain correlated negatively with happiness (r = –0.35 to −0.41, p &lt; 0.001). Tremor reports showed fair agreement with clinician ratings (χ 2 = 18.54, p &lt; 0.001; κ = 0.36), whereas rigidity showed negligible agreement (χ 2 = 0.00, p = 1.000; κ = 0.01). Conclusion The PIS Report provides a structured digital tool enhancing patient–clinician communication and remote monitoring by capturing pain, OFF states, and emotional symptoms. Integration with wearables and telemedicine may advance patient-centered PD care. Trial Registration CRIS (KCT0006646); ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05621772).",

    "Abstract": "Populism has emerged as a powerful communication strategy in Pakistan. This study investigates: (i) the anti-military narratives employed by Pakistani politicians on X, (ii) the influence of these narratives on public behavior within digital discourse, and (iii) the counter-narratives advanced by the military. The dataset comprised 690 posts from X authored by six prominent politicians affiliated with three major political parties (PTI, PMLN, and PPP), which the study categorizes as populist and non-populist. The data also included 55,227 digital citizens’ comments and 146 press releases issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media and public relations wing of the Pakistan military. To analyze these datasets, we applied Laclau’s discourse theory of populism and van Dijk’s ideological square. The study reveals that each actor elevates his or her own moral identity while situating opponents as immoral. In so doing, they produce a hall of mirrors where civic-populism faces off against security-populism, and both insist they incarnate the national will. Whereas digital citizens, by contrast, draw heavily on politicians’ narratives to amplify anti-military sentiments. This study demonstrates that populism in Pakistan is not only a political trend but also a communication strategy, a digital phenomenon, and a mirror of societal anxieties, grievances, and demands for representation and power.",

    "Abstract": "In mental health and substance use, assessment and the resulting diagnosis determine the choice of treatment or therapy to be used with the individual client. In health policy today, treatment should be evidence based and standardized. Health care thus draws on New Public Management principles, where only those methods and practices considered to be evidence based are accepted in the “market” of public health care. However, we view psychotherapy and mental health work as a meeting between persons that in the spirit of standardization might well be labelled “an individual case.” Psychiatric diagnoses are subject not only to standardization but also to a focus on identity and similarities, as more generally seen in Western science and philosophy. Difference arises when comparing identities; difference is secondary to identities. In this article, we draw on the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari to explore whether an ontology of difference could be helpful in therapy. An ontology of difference speaks to our experience as therapists, researchers, and teachers that there will always be difference, and that identities are secondary to difference. Rather than providing standardized answers, knowledge is useful for speculating, experimenting, and bringing forth innovative suggestions as to what could be helpful therapy in the individual case. We do not know what psychotherapy and mental health work can become and we need tools for experimentation, suggestions, and visions of what could be helpful. This must be based on collaborative relationships with those who seek help and support. The central question is, then: What can therapy become?",

    "Abstract": "Objective Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) complicating lupus nephritis (LN) may arise from two distinct pathways: uncontrolled systemic inflammation (activity-associated CSC) or as an iatrogenic complication of therapy (glucocorticoid-induced CSC). This study aims to propose a clinically actionable framework for differentiating these entities and guide trigger-specific treatment selection. Methods We present a novel case of glucocorticoid (GC)-induced CSC successfully treated with a GC-free belimumab-tacrolimus regimen. A case report integrated with a review of the literature (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, until May 2024) was conducted to identify all reported cases of concurrent LN and CSC. Cases were stratified by presumed CSC trigger, and treatment outcomes were analyzed. Results Four cases, including our index case, were analyzed. Two cases of activity-associated CSC (no recent GC exposure) achieved dual remission with aggressive GC-based immunosuppression. Two cases of GC-induced CSC (onset post-GC initiation) only achieved CSC remission after implementing GC-sparing strategies (GC taper to ≤5 mg/d or cessation). A treatment-trigger mismatch (using high-dose GC for GC-induced CSC) was associated with worsened ophthalmological outcomes. Conclusion These findings support a dichotomous pathogenesis model for CSC in LN. Correctly classifying CSC as activity-associated or glucocorticoid-induced is the critical first step in management. This distinction informs opposing therapeutic strategies: standard GC-based immunosuppression is appropriate for the former, while prompt initiation of GC-sparing therapy is imperative for the latter. This proposed framework offers a path to resolve the longstanding therapeutic paradox in this complex clinical scenario.",

    "Abstract": "Undergraduate public health programs have expanded in Asia, yet little is known about how national contexts shape curriculum design and workforce preparation. This study compares the undergraduate public health curricula of Taiwan and Vietnam to examine how governance structures, health system priorities, and workforce needs influence educational models. A comparative curriculum analysis was conducted using official program documents, supported by interviews with senior faculty to contextualize policy and institutional factors. Courses were categorized into major domains to assess required and elective distributions, thematic emphases, specialization pathways, and internship structures. Taiwan’s curriculum emphasizes flexibility and specialization, with extensive electives and strong representation in environmental and occupational health, epidemiology, and quantitative analysis, alongside pathways linked to professional certification. Vietnam’s curriculum is standardized and community-oriented, emphasizing foundational medical sciences, communicable disease control, health promotion, and sequenced community-based internships that reflect its vertically organized preventive health system. Differences in experiential learning and credentialing opportunities further distinguish workforce preparation in the two countries. The findings show that curriculum architecture mirrors broader national development priorities and system capacities. The study underscores the importance of competency-based and context-responsive curriculum reform and provides insights for strengthening public health workforce readiness across the Asia-Pacific region.",

This study compares differences in medication adherence, adherence barriers, and symptom severity of individuals with BD-SUD based on diagnostic status (current, past, or none). Methods This interim analysis utilized screening and baseline data from a 12-month randomized controlled trial comparing adherence interventions among poorly adherent individuals with BD. Patients were recruited from public mental health settings and met strict diagnostic and symptom criteria. Results From the study sample ( N = 129; M age = 42.18; SD age = 13.04), no significant sociodemographic differences were found. Individuals with BD and current substance use disorder reported significantly higher rates of problematic substance use and motivation to reduce such use compared to the other groups. No other differences were found. Conclusions Comorbid substance use disorder is common among individuals with bipolar disorder and often associated with poor outcomes. In this baseline, cross-sectional analysis, minimal differences were observed across varying BD-SUD status. Longitudinal analyses will be important for clarifying whether adherence and related outcomes differ over time across BD-SUD groups.",

This article examines how the Norwegian Joint Custody Association, Foreningen 2 Foreldre (F2F), developed and circulated knowledge in the period 1985–1997. The article analyses how the leaders of F2F positioned themselves as counter-experts in relation to what I conceptualize as a state-feminist knowledge regime . Drawing on oral history interviews with former activists and archival material, it shows how their engagement with knowledge developed into a sustained critique of local expert authority. Rather than relying on reductive portrayals of fathers’ rights advocates, the article situates F2F within a contested policy terrain. In doing so, it explores what their story can teach us about the shifting boundaries of expertise and gender politics in the Nordic welfare state.",

    "Abstract": "The use of recycled aggregates (RA) derived from construction and demolition waste (CDW) offers a viable alternative to natural aggregates (NA), with potential to reduce reliance on virgin resources. However, the effective utilization of RA requires integrated process design to mitigate the adverse effects of adhered mortar and interfacial heterogeneity. This study proposes an integrated multi-stage treatment framework for RA, combining mild chemical pre-soaking, controlled mechanical abrasion, and pressurized carbonation, with emphasis on process sequencing and threshold-based optimization. Raw RA was soaked in a mild acetic acid solution for 24 h, mechanically processed using a Los Angeles abrasion test machine (LAATM) at rotation levels ranging from 0 to 600, and subsequently subjected to 2 h of pressurized carbonation. The resulting combinedly treated recycled aggregates (CTRAs) were incorporated into M40-grade concrete at replacement levels of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100%. Mechanical performance was evaluated through compressive and splitting tensile strength tests. The results indicate the existence of a critical mechanical processing window at approximately 500 LAATM rotations, beyond which further processing provides diminishing benefits. Concrete incorporating 60% CTRA processed at 500 rotations exhibited a reduction of 17.34% in compressive strength and approximately 16% in splitting tensile strength relative to natural aggregate concrete, while maintaining stable performance trends within the investigated scope.

    "Abstract": "This article discusses how datawalks, a method of mobility that provides information about oneself in relation to space and others, can be used to research race through one’s embodied experience in space. Datawalks have often been used to explore experiences of minoritized rather than dominant groups and as a collaborative research-participant experience rather than a self-ethnographic endeavor. This article tackles these gaps by showing how datawalks can be used for researchers to address their positionalities within race relations. Drawing on datawalks the four authors did through parts of Rotterdam (the Netherlands), the article addresses how datawalks can (a) help researchers recognize and experience race in and through space and (b) engage with one’s positionality. This article points out the relevance of using datawalks as an in situ and in-movement method to capture the shape-shifting materiality of race in cities and to draw connections to structures of Whiteness in academia.",

    "Abstract": "Background Shortening chemotherapy infusion times is associated with improvements in resource use and patient satisfaction, as well as reductions in nursing workload and clinic wait times. Cyclophosphamide package inserts mention that the drug should be injected or infused very slowly, but the exact duration of infusion is not specified. Per literature review, there is heterogeneity in infusion times among regimens for various conditions. Methods The aim was to analyze the incidence of documented adverse events (AEs) temporally related to cyclophosphamide when it was administered as either a 60- or 30-minute infusion. We performed a retrospective chart review of records between January 1, 2023, and January 31, 2024, including adult patients (age &gt;= 18 years) who received at least one cyclophosphamide infusion over 60- or 30-minutes within selected chemotherapy regimens for lymphoma (CHOP +/- R; EPOCH +/- R; CHOEP +/- R) or multiple myeloma (MM) (CyBorD or VCD +/- Dara; KCyD +/- Dara) at any inpatient or outpatient site within Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS). Results Among 200 consecutive doses evaluated per disease-based group (n = 400 total doses), there were more numerical occurrences of documented AEs in the 60-minute groups compared to 30-minutes groups (n = 4 vs. n = 2), but this finding was not statistically significant (2% vs. 1%; p &gt; 0.05). There were no documented Grade 3 or higher AEs temporally related to cyclophosphamide infusion. Conclusion The shortening of cyclophosphamide infusion times for selected chemotherapy regimens was determined to be a safe practice change.",

Methods： In this prospective study, 196 corneal flaps were performed by LDV Z8 (66 eyes), LDV Z2 (70 eyes), VisuMax (60 eyes) laser. The expected flap thickness was 100 μm. Flap thickness was measured one week postoperatively at 28 points using RTVue Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).The side-cut angle was measured at three peripheral positions. Results The LDV Z8 had a significantly thicker mean central flap thickness (107.0 ± 5.0 μm) and mean flap thickness (110.5 ± 4.0 μm) compared to both the LDV Z2 (mean central 103.1 ± 4.2 μm (P ＜ 0.001), mean 107.5 ± 4.0 μm (P ＜ 0.001)) and the VisuMax (mean central 105.1 ± 5.4 μm (P ＜ 0.027), mean 108.3 ± 3.9 μm(P ＜ 0.002)). The mean overshoot of flap thickness between the actual and planned values was statistically significant (all groups, P &lt; 0.001). The corneal flap thicknesses of the 0-, 45-, 90- and 135-degree meridians showed great uniformity in all groups. The center-peripheral corneal thickness difference in the LDV Z2 (6.1 ± 3.3 μm) was larger compared to the differences in the LDV Z8 (4.0 ± 3.9 μm) ( P = 0.003) and the VisuMax (3.4 ± 5.1 μm) ( P = 0.002). The mean side-cut angles for the VisuMax, LDV Z8, and LDV Z2 were 62.4 ± 4.5 degrees, 92.3 ± 14.4 degrees, and 147.6 ± 6.7 degrees, respectively. Conclusion The corneal flaps generated by three femtosecond lasers exhibit good morphology. The thickness of the flaps in all groups was close to but slightly thicker than the target thickness.",

It critically engages with the long-standing debate between symbolic and connectionist approaches, examining AI’s epistemological underpinnings through the lens of Vygotsky’s insights. Until recently, the cultural-historical nature of human cognitive processes and the socio-historical embeddedness of AI technologies have remained largely unexplored areas in AI research, representing a terra incognita for the field.

    "Abstract": "Objectives Research has highlighted poorer experiences of cancer care amongst ethnically minoritised groups. Whilst significant strides have been made in understanding cancer experiences of minoritised adults, there exists a knowledge gap in understanding how cancer impacts on minoritised young people, many of whom are faced with complex developmental challenges. This study aimed to understand the experiences of cancer and cancer care amongst minoritised youths in the UK. Method Nine young people aged between 16 to 24 with diverse types of cancer diagnoses, who self-identified as ethnically minoritised shared their cancer experiences in semi-structured interviews. Participants’ stories were analysed using thematic narrative analysis. Results Findings identified three core narratives reflecting participants’ emotional journey through cancer, their cultural stories and cancer care experiences, encompassing 12 themes. Their journeys shared common themes of: Feeling Dismissed; Shock and Turmoil; Grieving Self and Changes; Isolated and Helpless; Adapting in Adversity; and “Changed for the better”. Cultural narratives revealed diverging views towards family support, while cultural influences on treatment options and feelings of being othered also complicated their cancer experiences. Overall, participants shared positive experiences of cancer care. Despite a protracted journey to diagnosis, personalised, accessible care and experiences of feeling seen were valued. Conclusion The findings shed light on cultural influences towards minoritised young people’s experiences of cancer and care. Implications around strengthening cultural sensitivity and visibility were highlighted. Future research may be helpful to hone into minoritised cancer experiences at different stages during one’s cancer journey including survivorship across more diverse socio-cultural contexts and how systemic factors may impact on the provision of culturally competent care.",

    "Abstract": "This study presents the experimental determination of Johnson–Cook (JC) strength and failure model constants for AA1100H14 aluminum alloy and their validation through ballistic impact testing. A series of mechanical testing has been performed using an INSTRON UTM for low and a SHPB under high strain-rate conditions, covering a range of strain rates (10 −4 to 190 s −1 ) and temperatures (25°C to 300°C). The derived JC parameters, capturing alloy's strain hardening, strain-rate sensitivity, and thermal softening behavior, are incorporated in ANSYS/AUTODYN software for simulations. Simulations modeled ballistic impact scenarios with three different nose shapes of projectiles: blunt, conical and ogive, made of 4340 steel impacting AA1100H14 targets under conditions matching experimental testing. The predicted residual velocities and damage mode, such as shear plugging for blunt projectiles and petalling for conical and ogive projectiles, are compared with the outcomes of ballistic tests. The close agreement between simulated and experimental results confirms the accuracy of the experimentally determined JC model parameters, exhibiting their relevance in forecasting the dynamic behavior of AA1100H14 under ballistic impact.",

    "Abstract": "Dual fuel combustion is a promising solution to lowering engine emissions and enabling higher fuel flexibility. High cyclic variability is one of the main challenges of dual fuel combustion which can compromise emissions, operational stability, and drivability. Recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) is a potent tool for the quantification of cyclic variability, however the application of RQA to engine cylinder pressure data represents methodological challenges. In this work, a systematic RQA approach for cyclic pressure variations is proposed with two main contributions: (1) a methodology to determine RQA parameters to capture inter-cycle recurrences, and (2) a sliding window technique to enable real-time crank-angle-resolved analysis. This methodology was demonstrated using four firing conditions with increased cyclic variability from the most stable neat diesel case to highly unstable dual fuel cases with increasing percentage of natural gas substitution. Phase-space reconstruction enabled qualitative investigation using recurrence plots. The results showed that RQA can capture nuances in the cyclic dynamics not readily captured using averaged integrated quantities such as the indicated mean effective pressure, cumulative heat release, or combustion phasing. The median recurrence rate (RR) was shown to consistently decrease with increased cyclic variability. Determinism (DET) decreases then increases with higher cyclic variability. This finding reveals the paradox that lower repeatability (or RR) does not necessarily lead to lower predictability (or DET) as is sometimes the case with partially misfiring cycles being followed by more robust recovery cycles. These results can have significant implications for real-time cycle-by-cycle engine control.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the evolving leadership identity among a new generation of Russian business leaders, challenging the temporal stability of static cross-cultural frameworks. Based on qualitative interviews with 30 MBA graduates in Moscow, Russia, the findings propose a model of hybrid leadership characterized by confidence, result-driven inspiration, relational care and ingenious concept of otvetstvennost (ownership and moral responsibility). The research reveals a significant shift in leadership perceptions, where emerging leaders favor participative, humane-oriented, and transformational leadership styles over traditional authoritarian approaches. However, this transition is marked by a sociolinguistic tension: a persistent reluctance to internalize the term “leader” despite demonstrating leadership behaviors. This generational shift is theorized as an identity struggle between entrenched national prototypes and global managerial exemplars. The implications suggest that leadership development in transitional economies functions as an “identity laboratory,” requiring programs that reconcile local cultural nuances with evolving global standards.",

    "Abstract": "Diabetes is a growing public health burden across the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. The increasing use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) holds significant potential to improve glycemic control and safety outcomes in individuals with diabetes. However, CGM devices in APAC vary widely in technical performance, clinical validation, and regulatory oversight, posing risks of inaccurate readings and treatment errors, especially for nonadjunctive integrated CGM (iCGM) systems. This review synthesizes the literature and regional insights on CGM regulatory frameworks, accuracy standards, and unmet needs. The authors highlight the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) iCGM standards as the most stringent global standards. Adopting FDA iCGM criteria alongside the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine (IFCC) reporting recommendations, with contextual modifications for diverse epidemiological, infrastructural, and socioeconomic settings in APAC, is explored. A phased, regionally coordinated approach is proposed, incorporating voluntary benchmarks, capacity-building for lower-resourced regulators, regulatory reliance mechanisms, and shared postmarketing surveillance platforms. Emphasis is placed on multistakeholder collaboration and region-specific validation studies. Harmonizing iCGM regulatory standards in APAC is anticipated to enhance device accuracy, safety, and interoperability, improve diabetes care, and streamline regulatory processes, serving as a model for regulatory excellence for other emerging medical technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Missing premeal boluses negatively impacts glycemic outcomes in automated insulin delivery (AID) users. This prospective interventional study compared postprandial glycemia after missed bolus across three AID systems in children with type 1 diabetes (CwD). Methods: CwD using MiniMed 780G (780G), Tandem Control-IQ (CIQ), or Ypsomed CamAPS (CamAPS) consumed 30 g and 50 g of carbohydrates (CH) in the form of standardized enteral nutrition, purposely omitting a premeal bolus. The mean area under the curve (AUC) of glucose concentration change and continuous glucose monitoring metrics were analyzed over 4 h postprandially and compared between the systems. Results: Forty-three CwD completed the study (mean age = 13 years, mean HbA1c = 47 mmol/mol [6.5%]). The lowest mean AUC was reached by 780G, followed by CIQ and CamAPS (137 vs. 144 vs. 156 mmol/L·sec·10 3 , P &lt; 0.01). Similar trends were seen after 50 g of CH. CamAPS users spent more time in level 2 hyperglycemia (26% for 30 g, 42% for 50 g) compared to CIQ (9.9% and 26%) and 780G (5.0% and 21%; P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: AID systems differ in their capacity to compensate for missed premeal boluses. 780G and CIQ outperformed CamAPS in limiting postprandial hyperglycemia, suggesting they may be preferable for CwD prone to bolus omission.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) present early subclinical signs of vascular and endothelial dysfunction. Hybrid closed-loop systems (HCLSs) are the gold standard for glycemic management; however, their cardiovascular benefits remain unclear. The aim of this study is to determine whether HCLS improves vascular and endothelial function compared with multiple daily injections (MDIs) or sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) in T1D. Research Design and Methods: Ninety consecutive patients with poorly controlled T1D under MDI treatment were categorized into three groups according to the treatment approach: (1) HCLS or (2) SGLT-2i added to MDI or (3) intensification of MDI treatment. We assessed at baseline and 6 and 12 months posttreatment: (1) continuous glucose monitoring metrics, (2) pulse wave velocity (PWV) and central systolic blood pressure (cSBP) and central diastolic blood pressure (cDBP) as markers of vascular function, and (3) the perfused boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels, as a marker of endothelial glycocalyx integrity. Results: At 6 months, HCLS demonstrated the most significant increase in time in range (TIR) followed by SGLT-2i (+28.61 vs +10.91, P = 0.026) compared with MDI group (+2.11, P &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons). At 12 months, patients on HCLS showed a 2-fold and a 4-fold higher increase in TIR compared with SGLT-2i ( P = 0.026) and MDI group ( P &lt; 0.001), respectively. At 12 months, HCLS and SGLT-2i group displayed the most significant decrease in PWV (−15.71% and −10.14%), cSBP (−8.15% and −6.88%), and PBR (−6.98% and −8.98%) compared with MDI (+5.67%, +1.49%, and +1.99%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). The absolute change of PWV, PBR, and cSBP was associated with the absolute change of TIR ( P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: MiniMed TM 780G HCLS demonstrated superiority over MDI or SGLT-2i in terms of glycemic control and cardiovascular function in T1D. These results support HCLS as a preferred therapeutic option for the prevention of cardiometabolic disease in individuals with T1D, in a population whose cardiovascular burden is often underrecognized in both research and clinical practice.",

Data were assessed using Cochrane’s RoB 2 tool and GRADE, with random-effects models applied for statistical analyses. Results: The analysis revealed higher scores for telehealth in interpersonal manner (MD = 0.19) and time spent with providers (MD = 0.26), while other PSQ-18 domains showed no significant differences. Postoperative complications, including UTI unplanned visits, phone calls, hospitalizations, and emergency care access, were similar between telehealth and in-person follow-up. Sensitivity analysis and quality assessment (using RoB 2 and GRADE) indicated a critical risk of bias and low certainty of evidence. Conclusion: Telehealth follow-up after gynecological surgery is as safe as in-person care, with similar complication rates and unplanned healthcare utilization. It also improves patient satisfaction, adherence, and cost efficiency, making it a viable, resource-effective alternative for postoperative care.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study analyzed the intention to use military telemental health services and its influencing factors, based on an integrated theoretical framework combining the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and the Health Belief Model. Methods: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional design was employed. Data were collected through an online survey conducted over a 4-week period from July 9 to August 8, 2025. Results: The mean intention-to-use score, measured on a 7-point Likert scale, was 4.57 (±1.24), indicating a relatively positive level. Intention to use was significantly higher among established patients than new patients. In the multiple regression analysis, social influence and number of visits were identified as statistically significant factors associated with intention to use. Conclusions: External factors, such as social influence and prior medical experience, were more strongly associated with intention to use than with individual perceptions of service utilization. These results indicate the need for organizations to foster positive awareness of telemental health services. Furthermore, it is essential to address potential barriers related to resources, information, and security in advance. This study will serve as a foundation for system development and for future research on intention to use military telemental health.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is a predictor of ischemic heart disease and closely linked to metabolic syndrome (MS). This study investigates the relationship between CAC and benign hepato-pancreaticobiliary disorders. Methods: A retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study was conducted on individuals who underwent cardiac computed tomography scans between 2015 and 2022 at a tertiary medical center. Multivariate logistic regression explored the association between CAC and potential confounders. Additionally, a logistic regression model was applied to determine whether CAC independently predicts benign hepato-pancreaticobiliary disorders [steatotic liver disease (SLD), fatty pancreas, gallstones, choledocholithiasis, pancreatic calcifications, and pancreatic duct stones]. Results: Among 2422 individuals, 725 met inclusion. Univariate regression analysis indicated CAC was significantly linked to SLD, older age, male sex, and MS. Both SLD and fatty pancreas showed an association with CAC in individuals with and without MS ( P &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that CAC was independently associated with increasing age [OR: 1.18 (95% CI: 1.15–1.62), P &lt; 0.001], male sex [OR: 3.12 (95% CI: 2.52–4.26), P &lt; 0.001], MS [OR: 1.29 (95% CI: 1.25–2.45), P &lt; 0.001], SLD [OR: 1.26 (95% CI: 1.12–2.42), P &lt; 0.001], fatty pancreas [OR: 1.79 (95% CI: 1.19–1.98), P &lt; 0.001], gallstones [OR: 1.82 (95% CI: 1.64–2.05), P &lt; 0.001], choledocholithiasis [OR: 1.21 (95% CI: 1.19–2.62), P &lt; 0.001], and pancreatic calcifications [OR: 1.74 (95% CI: 1.12–2.32), P &lt; 0.001], regardless of MS. Conclusions: The CAC score is correlated with an increased prevalence of SLD, fatty pancreas, and other benign pancreaticobiliary conditions, independent of MS.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Aims: There is growing interest in leveraging real-world data, such as electronic health records, administrative claims data, and patient registries, to generate real-world evidence studies that support the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s premarket and postmarket regulatory determinations of effectiveness and/or safety for novel therapeutics. We examined the frequency and characteristics of real-world evidence studies used by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to support premarket determinations of effectiveness and/or safety, as well as those required or requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be conducted postmarket after approval. Methods: We identified all novel therapeutics approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration between 2016 and 2024, using action packages from the Drugs@FDA database. Product labels, approval letters, and review documents were used to identify real-world evidence studies supporting premarket determinations of effectiveness and/or safety, as well as all postmarketing requirements or commitments outlined at the time of approval. Outcomes included the number of novel therapeutics approved with premarket and/or postmarket real-world evidence studies and characteristics of these studies, including study design, data source, and primary objectives. Results: From 2016 to 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved 400 novel therapeutics for 543 indications, of which 43 (10.8%) had at least one real-world evidence study that supported premarket determinations of effectiveness and/or safety (64 unique studies), and 138 (34.5%) had at least one real-world evidence study required or requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be conducted postmarket after approval (208 unique studies). Among the 64 unique premarket real-world evidence studies, the most common study designs were non-interventional (observational) studies (35, 54.7%) and externally controlled trials (17, 26.6%); 38 (59.4%) studies utilized electronic health or medical records, and 47 (73.4%) provided evidence on effectiveness. Among the 208 unique postmarket real-world evidence studies, the most common study design was non-interventional (observational) studies (159, 76.4%); 61 (29.3%) studies identified registries as the proposed data source, and 197 (94.7%) were designed to provide evidence on safety alone. The proportion of therapeutics approved with at least one postmarket real-world evidence study increased over time from 2 of 20 (10.0%) in 2016 to 23 of 47 (48.9%) in 2024; however, only 7 (3.4%) of these studies were classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as fulfilled or submitted as of May 2025. Conclusions: Real-world evidence studies are infrequently used to support the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s premarket determinations of effectiveness and/or safety but have been increasingly required or requested by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be conducted postmarket after approval; however delays in completing postmarket real-world evidence studies may limit their regulatory impact.",

    "Abstract": "Net water uptake (NWU) is an emerging quantitative imaging biomarker for assessing cerebral edema in acute ischemic stroke. By quantifying the increase in brain water content within ischemic regions on computed tomography (CT), NWU offers a direct assessment of edema formation and its temporal evolution. Unlike conventional imaging markers such as infarct volume or ASPECTS, NWU provides specific information about the degree of tissue injury, which is a key determinant of clinical outcome. Observational studies have demonstrated that higher NWU is associated with malignant edema, hemorrhagic transformation, and worse functional outcomes, and that lower NWU may identify patients more likely to benefit from reperfusion and anti-edema therapies. This narrative review, based on a structured PubMed search of CT-based NWU studies in acute ischemic stroke, summarizes the technical methods for measuring NWU, its pathophysiological basis, and its potential clinical applications. We discuss the use of NWU for predicting outcomes, identifying patients at risk for malignant edema and hemorrhagic transformation, and selecting patients for emerging neuroprotective therapies. We also highlight the potential role of NWU in extending treatment windows and monitoring treatment response. Finally, we address the practical limitations of NWU, including situations in which reliable quantification is not feasible, and outline future directions for validation in multi-center cohorts and clinical trials before NWU-based thresholds can be adopted for routine decision-making.",

    "Abstract": "This article explores how the Indigenous philosophy of Obuntubulamu (a Buganda version of Ubuntu) may offer a more holistic and inclusive framework for fostering inclusion among youth in Norway. It is grounded in a qualitative case study of youth workshops with four participants aged 14 to 16 from diverse backgrounds, focusing especially on one girl’s evolving self-representations and the corresponding peer discussions. Drawing on decolonial thinking, the analysis uses Obuntubulamu to illustrate how relationships with family, friends, nature, and ancestors provide a lens for foster inclusion and diversity. By integrating my lived experiences of Obuntubulamu, I position this Indigenous framework as a more holistic alternative to dominant Western perspectives of inclusion and discuss how this alternative perspective contrasts and expands Norwegian approaches.",

    "Abstract": "Study Design Basic Science Study. Objectives To determine the impact of rod composition and bending method on metal debris production during fatigue testing of posterolateral lumbar fusion constructs. Methods Posterolateral lumbar fusion constructs were embedded into Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMW-PE) blocks and subject to fatigue testing, following a modified ASTM F1717-21 protocol including cycles of compression with novel axial rotation. Variations in constructs included rod bending methods of pre-bent (PB) and surgeon-bent (SB) and rod compositions of titanium alloy (Ti) or cobalt chromium alloy (CC). Constructs were wrapped in lactated ringer solution-soaked cotton, which was dissolved and analyzed for metal particulate using inductively coupled mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Results Metal debris produced by surgeon-bent cobalt chromium and pre-bent cobalt chromium constructs did not have significant differences in quantity or quality. Pre-bent cobalt chromium alloy rods produced a larger amount of chromium and cobalt metal debris than pre-bent titanium alloy rods. Conclusions We find that cobalt chromium alloy rods produce more metal debris than titanium alloy rods. We find no evidence that rod bending method affects metal debris quality or quantity. In considering factors that impact susceptibility to corrosion and metallosis, our data supports that rod composition, but not bending method, contributes significantly to metal debris production.",

    "Abstract": "Study Design Retrospective Cohort Study. Objectives To compare 1-year postoperative outcomes and complication rates between single-level lumbar laminectomy and hemilaminectomy using a large, multicenter, propensity-matched dataset. Methods We queried the TriNetX global health research network (≥160 million patients) for adults undergoing single-level lumbar decompression between January 2005 and July 2025. Cohorts were defined by CPT codes: laminectomy and hemilaminectomy, with qualifying diagnoses of lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, or radiculopathy. Patients with fusion, prior lumbar surgery, or non-degenerative pathology were excluded. Outcomes included new postoperative events within 1 year: mortality, weakness, pain, sensory loss, cauda equina syndrome, radiculopathy, foot drop, CSF leak, and surgical-site infection. Propensity-score matching balanced demographics and comorbidities. Cox proportional hazards models, Kaplan–Meier curves, and relative risks were calculated. Results Of 167,177 patients, 80,440 underwent laminectomy and 86,737 hemilaminectomy. After matching, 50,853 patients per cohort were analyzed. One-year mortality was similar (0.57% vs 0.49%, HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.01-1.42; P = 0.045). Laminectomy conferred significantly higher risks of CSF leak (1.41% vs 1.00%; RR 1.41), surgical-site infection (1.45% vs 1.00%; RR 1.45), cauda equina syndrome (0.36% vs 0.22%; RR 1.62), and persistent weakness (4.12% vs 3.67%; RR 1.12). Persistent radiculopathy was modestly less frequent after laminectomy (10.5% vs 12.0%; RR 0.87). Other outcomes, including pain and foot drop, were comparable. Conclusions Hemilaminectomy was associated with lower perioperative complication rates compared to laminectomy, while laminectomy provided a modest reduction in persistent radiculopathy. These findings highlight a tradeoff between safety and decompressive efficacy, emphasizing the importance of patient-specific surgical selection.",

    "Abstract": "The Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) are increasingly integrated into health professions curricula. As a result, public health educators are often tasked with teaching these concepts to students outside their discipline, including those in nursing and health sciences. This article describes a fully asynchronous online module that uses applied data analysis and visualization to enhance undergraduate understanding of SDOH across disciplinary boundaries. The module incorporated active learning strategies, engaging students in hands-on mapping, analysis, and structured reflection using real-world data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Census Bureau, and Feeding America. Students created maps, correlation matrices, and scatterplots in Microsoft Excel while exploring the implications of health disparities. Survey results showed statistically significant improvements in self-reported understanding of SDOH among nursing and health sciences students. Most students rated the module as more engaging and effective than traditional instructional approaches. These findings suggest that fundamental data analysis and basic mapping activities can serve as an effective pedagogical bridge for teaching complex population health concepts to students without prior training in public health. This instructional approach offers a scalable, accessible model for integrating SDOH into interdisciplinary health professions education.",

The main goal of this article is to present a quantitative analysis of the status of educational inclusion of the Musahar community since independence and their participation in formal education, that is, educational development after the independence of India. Along with this, comparative studies are also done at the state and national levels by analysing the key demographic data of the Musahar community. The study shows that the current decadal population growth rate of the Musahar community is higher than that of all the Musahar-populated states in India. The sex ratio of the Musahar community since independence was higher than the sex ratio of India till the census year 1981 but has decreased since then till the latest census year (2011). Only 22% of the Musahar population is literate, while only 5.66% of the Musahar have studied up to the primary junior basic level. Only 0.06% of Musahar have graduated or exceeded the academic level in India. Additional governmental and non-governmental efforts are required to improve the educational inclusion of the Musahar community.",

    "Abstract": "Industry 5.0's imperatives of human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience highlight emerging challenges for project-based manufacturing, particularly in balancing customized client requirements with operational efficiency while coordinating diverse stakeholders. Service-oriented approaches offer potential pathways to address these imperatives through collaboration and value cocreation, though it remains unclear how these principles translate into competitive advantage. The critical question is whether implementation mechanisms, specifically adaptive capabilities, are needed to operationalize service-oriented principles in dynamic project environments. This study therefore examines how service-dominant orientation contributes to sustainable competitive advantage through collaborative agility in Brazil's printing industry, a largely project-based manufacturing sector. Using partial least squares structural equation modelling with survey data from 209 organizations, we test whether collaborative agility mediates this relationship. Our results reveal that service-dominant orientation has limited effect on sustainable competitive advantage, but operates entirely through collaborative agility, accounting for 92.9% of the total effect. Among collaborative agility's three dimensions (operational, partnership, and resource agility), partnership agility emerges as the strongest. For project-based organizations navigating Industry 5.0, this suggests that collaborative values deliver results when implemented through agile operational, partnership, and resource management capabilities.",

Here, we report the primary analysis of the multiple-ascending-dose Part B in people with hemophilia A (PwHA). Eligible participants were men with severe HA without FVIII inhibitors. Four dose cohorts (B1-B4) were planned, with NXT007 administered subcutaneously at maintenance doses of 0.072 mg/kg, 0.28 mg/kg, 0.70 mg/kg, and 1.08 mg/kg, respectively, every 4 weeks. Primary endpoints were safety (adverse events [AEs] and serious AEs [SAEs]), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy; secondary endpoints included incidence of anti-NXT007 antibodies (ADAs). Participants in cohorts B1 (n=10), B2 (n=6), B3 (n=6), and B4 (n=8) had received NXT007 for a median (minimum-maximum) of 114.1 (29-140), 96.4 (88-112), 58.1 (52-72), and 22.2 (4-28) weeks, respectively. Two participants discontinued treatment: NXT007-unrelated AE (n=1) and complete loss of NXT007 exposure due to ADAs (n=1). Participants' plasma NXT007 concentration showed a dose-dependent increase, and predicted FVIII-equivalent activity reached a non-hemophilic level (≥40 IU/dL) in B2 onwards. NXT007 had a favorable safety profile at all doses. Most AEs were mild/moderate and all three SAEs were considered unrelated to NXT007. Mean annualized treated bleed rates were 1.48 (B1), 0.28 (B2), 0.00 (B3), and 0.00 (B4). Pharmacokinetics-affecting NXT007 ADAs were observed in two participants, including the participant in B1 who discontinued. NXTAGE Part B demonstrates that NXT007 could provide non-hemophilic coagulation activity in PwHA, with a less burdensome dose regimen than currently available therapies.",

Objectives This study aims to uncover the genetic factors associated with lung function decline, using the Lifelines cohort study. Methods Longitudinal data covering 3 visits over approximately 15 years were available. Genotyping and longitudinal spirometry data were present for 24 749 subjects aged 25 or older at baseline. A three-step approach was used. First, lung function change over time was estimated using a linear-mixed effect model. Second, a genome-wide association study for the estimated change was conducted, adjusting for age, sex, smoking load and the first 10 principal components. Third, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with p-value &lt;1×10 −5 were analysed using a linear-mixed effect model. Selected SNPs were tested in two independent cohorts (N=1376 and N=27 249), followed by meta-analysis. Measurements and Main Results Among the included individuals, 19 722 had spirometry at two timepoints and 5027 at three, with median [IQR] follow-up of 8.1 [4.4, 10.4] and 12.1 [11, 13.6] years, respectively. We identified 67 variants suggestively associated with lung function decline (p&lt;1×10 −5 ). Rs150094594, was significant (p=0.007) in a replication cohort with consistent effect direction. This intergenic variant, not previously reported, reached genome-wide significance in the meta-analysis (rs150094594:T, β( se ): 15.9(2.7) ml/year, p-value=3.9×10 −9 ). Conclusions This study shows a role of genetics in lung function decline, emphasizing the importance of exploring the interplay between genetic and environmental factors.",

    "Abstract": "Background Quality of life (QoL), the highest prioritised outcome by children with bronchiectasis and their parents, is a patient-reported outcome measure increasingly considered essential when evaluating health and interventions. Despite this, there are no validated instruments that specifically measure QoL related to bronchiectasis in children. We aimed to develop and validate a new bronchiectasis child-specific parent-proxy QoL instrument (BC-QoL). Methods We developed a draft 44-item BC-QoL and subsequently conducted a prospective cohort study where 142 parents completed draft BC-QoL and six other measures: two validated cough scores, parent-proxy children's acute cough-specific QoL, depression, anxiety and stress 21-item scale, RAND-36 and paediatric QoL (PedsQL TM 4.0) to assess the convergent and discriminant validity of the BC-QoL. The questionnaires were completed over three weeks at different phases of their child's illness (stable state, exacerbation and/or recovery). Responses were analysed using psychometric and clinical impact techniques to reduce items and determine the instrument's reliability and validity. Minimally important difference (MID) was also calculated. Results The final 23-item BC-QoL instrument with its three domains (emotional, physical, social well-being) demonstrated high split half reliability (0.95), Cronbach's alpha (0.97), repeatability (intraclass coefficient=0.74, 95%CI 0.62–0.82), validity and responsiveness. BC-QoL's domains significantly correlated with that of PedsQL TM 4.0 (Spearman correlations: emotional=0.43, social=0.41, physical=0.47). BC-QoL's MID ranged from 0.74 to 1.32. Conclusion BC-QoL, the first bronchiectasis child-specific QoL instrument, has evidence demonstrating its validity and reliability, and can be used to evaluate the impact and effectiveness of interventions and better understand the disease burden in children with bronchiectasis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Enterocytozoon bieneusi ( E. bieneusi ) is a pathogenic microsporidian that affects immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV, and represents a major cause of diarrhea. It can severely impact human health, causing gastrointestinal disease, nutritional deficits, and life-threatening complications. However, the microbial mechanisms by which E. bieneusi affects host nutrition are not well understood. Wild rodents have long been considered valuable models for studying human diseases due to similarities in gut microbiota dynamics and immune responses, making them particularly relevant for investigating parasitic infections. Here, we assembled a comprehensive catalog of 9,929 non-redundant microbial genomes from wild rodent gut metagenomes and evaluated their potential for B vitamins and vitamin K 2 biosynthesis using comparative functional genomics. We identified 2,307 genomes encoding complete pathways for de novo biosynthesis of at least one essential vitamin, though no single genome encoded all pathways, indicating a distributed metabolic capacity within the microbial community. Infection with E. bieneusi significantly altered the microbial composition and the potential for vitamin biosynthesis, with a notable expansion of Methanobacteriota and reprogramming of pyridoxine (vitamin B 6 ) biosynthesis pathways. These changes reveal a functional shift in microbial metabolism in response to parasitic pressure. By elucidating the microbial basis of vitamin biosynthesis in wild rodents and the impact of E. bieneusi infection on microbial functions, this study provides new insights into the role of gut microbiota in maintaining host health and supporting nutrient provision under parasitic stress. Moreover, the findings will provide valuable insights into the prevention and control of E. bieneusi infection in a variety of host, including humans.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Assistive technologies may play a crucial role in addressing needs of people with dementia. While technical feasibility often drives development, the decision-making process that might lead to their adoption (or rejection) is not fully understood. We aim to explore contextual factors influencing this process and “necessities” technology should fulfil from the user-perspective, so that the use of assistive technologies can be better targeted– potentially fostering a more supportive home environment. Methods In this qualitative study, interviews (8 people with dementia and 7 partners) and focus groups (7 focus groups included a total of 29 participants) with individuals with milder stages of dementia living at home and their support/care-network were carried out. Grounded Theory and Structuring Content Analysis were used to analyse the data. Results Six main thematic categories outline the decision-making process. The “assessment of (one’s own) resources”, while evaluating the “(potential) benefits of assistive technologies” contrasts with “(potential) adverse effects” of their use (or their non-use respectively), shaping the context of the decision-making process. There is an appraisal of necessary “(pre-existing) trust” in technology. An a priori “openness towards assistive technologies” intersects latter aspects. A very substantial “need for information” is noted. Conclusions While technical feasibility and tailored solutions are important, they are not the sole determinants of assistive technology adoption in this group. The desire to preserve self-determination and independence emerges as a key motive for choosing assistive technologies; technology can also be seen to invoke stress and negative emotions, and will consequently be rejected. Technology should, moreover, be perceived to be “meaningful” on different levels. Considering these points when developing technologies and addressing them when counselling those affected by dementia and their networks may “tip the scale” towards acceptance.",

    "Abstract": "The Marburg virus (MARV), responsible for severe hemorrhagic fevers with mortality rates as high as 90%, remains a significant public health threat. This study employs machine learning to identify inhibitors targeting the MARV Gene 4 Small ORF protein, crucial for the virus's replication and immune evasion. The Gene 4 Small ORF protein is pivotal in taking over the host's cellular mechanisms, facilitating unchecked viral replication and significant immune system disruption. Effective targeting of this protein holds promise for mitigating the viral lifecycle and entry, potentially curbing the severity of the disease outbreaks. A dataset from PubChem, including 301,745 compounds, was utilized to train models like Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), CatBoost (CB), AdaBoost (AB), and Logistic Regression (LR). The activity outcomes were classified with integers active as 1 and inactive as 0, followed by molecular descriptor generation using RDKit and PaDEL. The models were trained on an 80:20 split and validated on a novel dataset to ensure robustness, with performance metrics such as accuracy and AUC-ROC guiding evaluation. Morgan fingerprints outperformed PubChem fingerprints, achieving higher accuracy (76%), precision (80%), and ROC-AUC (84%). Among the machine learning models evaluated, RF and GBM were the best performers, with RF achieving the highest specificity (83%) and ROC-AUC (0.84). Validation on new datasets further confirmed the effectiveness of these models, with RF and GBM demonstrating strong predictive reliability for identifying potential inhibitors of the Marburg virus. A Web Application known as MARVpred was developed to predict the activity of compounds with anti-MARV properties from the ChEMBL database. MARVpred is freely accessible online (https://igmr.org/software/marvpred). This study signifies a critical step forward in the computational prediction of viral inhibitors, offering a valuable tool for accelerating the development of Marburg virus therapeutics.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) are the main curative options for localized prostate cancer (PCA). However, both may significantly affect patients’ quality of life (QoL). Objective To retrospectively compare post-treatment QoL after at least 24 months of follow-up between bladder-neck- and nerve-sparing RALRP and IMRT in patients with intermediate-risk localized PCA. Methods A total of 164 patients treated between October 2016 and May 2023 were analyzed (104 RALRP; 60 IMRT). QoL was evaluated using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-2002). Urinary, bowel, sexual, and hormonal domains were compared using appropriate statistical tests . Results Baseline demographics were similar between groups. The mean age was 68.82 ± 6.72 years in the RALRP group and 68.89 ± 7.81 years in the IMRT group. IMRT patients reported better sexual function ( p &lt; 0.05), but this advantage was counteracted by hormonal side effects due to androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Urinary continence was comparable ( p &gt; 0.05), whereas irritative urinary symptoms were more common in IMRT ( p &lt; 0.001). Bowel function and overall satisfaction were significantly better in RALRP (both p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions After ≥ 24 months of follow-up, RALRP provided superior bowel and hormonal outcomes, while IMRT yielded slightly better sexual function scores. Overall satisfaction favored RALRP.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background India faces a growing need for Palliative Care due to its ageing population, rising cancer burden, and high prevalence of chronic illnesses. Unfortunately, less than 4% of the population has access to Palliative services, and the country ranks 59th in the 2021 Quality of Death Index. Contextually relevant and culturally sensitive nursing competencies are crucial to address this gap. However, there is no structured, evidence-based palliative nursing competency framework tailored to India’s sociocultural and healthcare realities. This study explored stakeholder perspectives to identify core nursing competencies required for palliative care in the Indian context. Methods A qualitative design was employed, comprising seven Focus Group Discussions with nurses involved in delivering care to patients with life-limiting illnesses, and thirty five In-Depth Interviews with patients and caregivers at various stages of the disease trajectory, from diagnosis to terminal illness and end-of-life. Data were analysed using Braun and Clarke’s thematic analysis approach. Line-by-line coding was conducted using Open Code 4.02 version to systematically identify themes and subthemes. These were synthesized into competency domains and statements that reflect the essential skills, knowledge, and attitudes required for palliative nursing in India. To ensure the rigor and trustworthiness of the findings, measures such as member checking and peer debriefing were undertaken throughout the research process. Results Thematic analysis yielded seven distinct competency domains. These domains captured a wide range of nursing roles, including understanding foundations of Palliative Care, communication, ethical, legal, and professional responsibilities, symptom management and enhancing comfort, psychosocial, cultural, and spiritual aspects of care, and team collaboration. The findings emphasized the importance of culturally grounded, holistic, and compassionate care tailored to the needs of Indian patients and their families. Importantly, region-specific factors, such as Indian family dynamics, cultural attitudes towards death, and spiritual beliefs, emerged prominently during the thematic analysis. Interestingly, there was a notable convergence between the views expressed by nurses in focus group discussions and those of participants in in-depth interviews regarding essential palliative care competencies. Conclusions This study presents an empirically derived set of thematic domains and insights for palliative care nursing competencies, grounded in stakeholder perspectives and tailored to the Indian context. The identified domains can inform curriculum development, training programs, and policy formulation to strengthen palliative care services across India.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Neonatal resuscitation requires mastery of technical and non-technical skills (NTS). The Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) emphasizes ventilation, along with effective leadership, teamwork, and situational awareness. Simulation-based education is central to NTS training but is resource-intensive with limited access in low- and middle-income countries. Augmented reality (AR) medical simulations offer a scalable, remote solution with fewer logistical barriers. Methods We conducted a prospective, single-arm feasibility study evaluating a remote AR medical simulation for assessing NTS during neonatal resuscitation. Instructors based in Northern California (Stanford School of Medicine) remotely facilitated pediatric and anesthesiology residents in Santiago, Chile (University of Chile) as team leaders in an NRP scenario delivered using an AR medical simulator. The primary outcome was NTS performance measured with the Anesthetists’ Non-Technical Skills (ANTS) tool. Secondary outcomes included the Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scale (BARS), system usability via the System Usability Scale (SUS), and ergonomics via the ISO 9241 − 400 scale. Results Thirty-four residents completed all sessions. Participants demonstrated adequate NTS performance, with ANTS scores 2.5–2.9 (scale 1–4) and BARS scores 5.2–5.4 (scale 1–9), similar to those observed in traditional, in-person simulations. SUS responses indicated high usability, and ergonomic results suggested minimal physical or cognitive burden.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Balint group work have been increasingly integrated into medical education worldwide. However, quantitative evaluations of their application in medical education using specialized instruments remain limited. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the application of Balint group work in medical education in China by assessing students’ perceived learning outcomes and group processes using the Balint Group Questionnaire (BGQ), and to examine factors associated with BGQ scores. Methods The Balint group work was embedded within a mandatory medical clinical communication course for postgraduate students. A total of 284 eligible students were approached, and 139 students (48.9%) provided complete questionnaire data and were included in the final analysis. Students could participate in up to six sessions of Balint group work. The BGQ was administered after each session to assess perceived effectiveness, operationalized as BGQ subscale scores reflecting reflective learning and group dynamics. Reliability and validity of the BGQ in this student population were evaluated. Correlation and subgroup analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with BGQ scores. Results Cronbach’s alpha coefficients indicated good internal consistency of the BGQ. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a three-factor model with acceptable model fit. Students with fewer years of clinical work experience reported higher BGQ scores across all subscales. A higher frequency of serving as a case reporter was positively associated with BGQ scores, particularly among students with ≥2 years of work experience. Conclusions The BGQ demonstrated good reliability and validity for assessing students’ perceived learning outcomes in Balint group work within medical education. Associations between BGQ scores, clinical experience, and case reporter roles suggest that early introduction of Balint groups and active engagement as case reporters may enhance perceived learning benefits.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can signal in the absence of agonists through constitutive activity. This activity can be enhanced by mutations, resulting in receptors known as constitutively active mutants (CAMs). Such receptors are implicated in various physiological and pathophysiological conditions, and also offer significant therapeutic potential. However, the molecular basis of their constitutive activity remains unknown. Results To investigate how CAMs affect receptor activation, we employed enhanced sampling simulations to study the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), a key target in central nervous system therapies. Free energy landscape analyses revealed that CAMs promote a conformational shift favoring an active state similar to the agonist-bound receptor. To then identify novel CAMs, we developed a comprehensive strategy combining structural comparison, in-silico residue scanning, and free energy calculations, validated by luminescence-complementation-based assays. Applied to D2R, this approach uncovered a new single-point CAM, D2R-I48 1.46 W, which was functionally validated. Further investigation revealed that this mutation activates allosteric communication pathways primarily involving transmembrane helix 5, particularly Ser194 5.43 , underscoring its role in transmitting activation signals to the intracellular domain. Conclusions This study elucidates how CAMs reshape the activation landscape of D2R and establishes a broadly applicable computational-experimental framework for discovering constitutively active GPCR variants. These CAMs provide valuable ligand-independent models for probing receptor activation mechanisms at structural, cellular, and physiological levels.",

    "Abstract": "In summary, we identified two genetic variants that modified the association between physical activity and CRC risk. One of them, related to GREM1 and SCG5, suggests that the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-related, inflammatory, and/or insulin signaling pathways may be involved in the protective association between physical activity and colorectal carcinogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background People with HIV (PWH) are at increased risk for chronic lung disease and may be more susceptible to pulmonary complications following severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. It remains unclear whether HIV infection modifies long-term pulmonary outcomes after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study assessed longitudinal changes in pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms among PWH and people without HIV (PWoH) with serologically-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods We analyzed data from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)/Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS), a prospective US cohort of PWH and PWoH. Participants with serologic evidence of past SARS-CoV-2 infection and acceptable pre- and post-SARS-CoV-2 pulmonary function testing (PFT) including spirometry and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were included. Annualized changes in post-bronchodilator (BD) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ), forced vital capacity (FVC), and DLCO were compared by HIV serostatus, stratified by sex. Respiratory symptoms were assessed using the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Linear regression estimated differences in pulmonary function change by HIV serostatus, stratifying by relevant covariates. Results Among 778 participants (204 men; 574 women) exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and who underwent PFTs before and after infection, 66% were PWH. Men with HIV (MWH) had a mean annualized FEV 1 decline of -44.3 mL/year versus -33.8 mL/year in men without HIV (MWoH) (mean difference -10.5 mL/year; 95% CI: -30.7, 9.7). Among women, FEV 1 declined -19.8 mL/year in PWH vs. -14.8 mL/year in PWoH (mean difference -5.0 mL/year; 95% CI: -18.2, 8.2). Changes in FVC and DLCO were similar across HIV serostatus groups. No consistent differences in respiratory symptom changes were observed between PWH and PWoH. Subgroup analyses did not reveal any HIV-associated differential changes. Conclusions Among individuals with serologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, HIV serostatus was not associated with greater declines in pulmonary function or worsening of respiratory symptoms. Our findings suggest that having HIV alone may not increase the risk for pulmonary impairments following a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further research is needed to understand how uncontrolled HIV infection and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase risks of adverse pulmonary outcomes following a SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "Abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor natural killer (CAR-NK) cells represent a promising \"off-the-shelf\" alternative to CAR-T cells, offering a superior safety profile and inherent multi-antigen targeting capabilities. However, their clinical potential is constrained by the \"CRISPR ceiling\", a set of practical limitations of DSB-based CRISPR-Cas9 such as DNA double-strand break (DSB)-associated chromosomal rearrangements and p53-mediated fitness loss, low efficiency for safe, large, multicistronic knock-ins, and rigid promoter-driven transgene expression that can cause tonic signaling. Importantly, next-generation, DSB-free base and prime editors reduce or eliminate the DSB-associated genotoxic stress observed with nuclease cutting, CRISPR-associated transposases now enable programmable, targeted insertion strategies that can accommodate larger cassettes, and synthetic/epigenetic circuits provide dynamic, context-dependent transgene control that avoids constitutive promoter-driven tonic signaling. This review explores technological approaches beyond conventional CRISPR, highlighting next-generation precision engineering tools that may enable improved CAR-NK therapies and represent potential advances in safety and efficacy. We detail how base editing, epigenetic reprogramming, targeted transposon systems, and synthetic biology circuits can be synergistically integrated to overcome critical clinical challenges. These advanced technologies enable the precise enhancement of three fundamental pillars of efficacy: Persistence through endogenous cytokine armoring and metabolic engineering; Trafficking via chemokine receptor matching and stromal barrier degradation; and Tumor Eradication using logic-gated targeting, immunomodulatory payloads, and bispecific engagers. By synthesizing these cutting-edge advances, we provide a roadmap for developing next-generation CAR-NK cells capable of durable, potent, and safe antitumor responses against both hematological and solid malignancies, ultimately forging a new frontier in accessible cellular immunotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Malaria remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly among children under five years of age in sub-Saharan Africa. Nigeria has the highest burden of malaria cases worldwide, accounting for 26% of all cases. The introduction of the R21/Matrix malaria vaccine is promising for reducing the malaria burden. However, vaccine awareness, perceptions, and willingness to pay among caregivers are key to ensuring successful rollout. This study assessed caregivers' awareness, perceptions, acceptability, and willingness to pay for the R21/MATRIX malaria vaccine in endemic communities in Lagos, Nigeria. Methods A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 372 caregivers of children under five years of age. A multistage sampling technique was employed to select respondents from five malaria-endemic communities in Lagos. Data were collected via a semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were computed, and binary logistic regression was used to identify predictors of vaccine awareness, perception, and willingness to pay. Results Awareness of the R21/MATRIX vaccine was low (9.7%), with the internet as the primary source of information. Positive perceptions of the vaccine were high, with 98.1% of caregivers believing it to be safe and effective. Acceptability was also high, as 76.6% of the caregivers indicated that they would \"definitely\" vaccinate their child. Willingness to pay was reported by 71.2% of the respondents, with 51.9% willing to pay between ₦1,001–₦5,000 per dose. The factors significantly associated with awareness included gender, marital status, and relationship with the child (p &lt; 0.05). Higher household income and guardianship status increased the likelihood of willingness to pay (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Despite the low awareness of the R21/MATRIX malaria vaccine, caregivers demonstrated a strong positive perception, high acceptability, and moderate willingness to pay. Targeted community awareness campaigns focused on the benefits and safety of the vaccine are essential to improve knowledge of the vaccine in endemic communities.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives Diabetic foot ulcer management relies predominantly on reactive treatment adjustments based on current wound status. This study developed an accessible machine learning framework using routinely collected clinical metadata (no imaging required) to predict healing phase transitions at the next clinical appointment, enabling proactive treatment planning with an integrated recommendation system. Methods Longitudinal data from 268 patients with 329 distinct ulcers across 890 appointments were analyzed. Features (n $$=$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mo>=</mml:mo> </mml:math> 103) including temporal measurements normalized by inter-appointment intervals were engineered. An Extra Trees classifier was optimized via Bayesian hyperparameter tuning with impurity-based feature selection and sequential augmentation to predict three transition categories: favorable, acceptable, or unfavorable. Threefold patient-level cross-validation ensured robust performance estimation. Results Feature selection identified 30 essential predictors, achieving 70.9% dimensionality reduction. The optimized classifier demonstrated 78% ± 4% accuracy with balanced category performance (per-class F1 scores: 0.72–0.84) and average AUC of 0.90. Historical phase features dominated predictive importance. The integrated treatment recommendation system achieved 88.7% within-category agreement for offloading prescriptions across all chronicity levels. Dressing recommendations demonstrated chronicity-stratified performance, with match rates declining from 83.7% for acute wounds to 5.6% for very chronic wounds, appropriately reflecting clinical reality that treatment-resistant wounds require individualized therapeutic experimentation. Conclusions This framework demonstrates potential for next-appointment trajectory prediction using accessible clinical metadata without specialized imaging, pending prospective validation. The chronicity-dependent recommendation performance appropriately distinguishes wounds amenable to standardized protocols from treatment-resistant cases requiring iterative experimentation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background About one-third of U.S. youth are overweight and most have at least one risk factor that increases their chance of developing cardiovascular or other chronic diseases. School- and research-based physical activity and healthy eating programs can reduce obesity and improve health outcomes; however, schools face many implementation challenges. Healthy School Recognized Campus (HSRC) bundles school- and researched-based programs to improve their implementation and student health outcomes. This paper describes the protocol for a hybrid type 2 implementation-effectiveness, cluster dual randomized controlled trial that evaluates the (aim 1) effectiveness of the HSRC initiative for improving health behaviors and (aim 2) the impact of an implementation strategy – school-to-school mentoring – on HSRC’s delivery. Methods Students in 4th through 9th grade ( n = 500) at public schools ( n = 20) across East and Central Texas will be randomized at the school level to determine the effectiveness of HSRC (vs. waitlist control condition) on BMI z-score (primary outcome), physical activity measured via accelerometer, and skin carotenoids (i.e., fruit and vegetable intake; secondary outcomes). Assessments will occur at the start and end of one school year. Program implementers ( n = 200) at schools will be randomized to assess the impact of the school-to-school mentoring strategy (vs. standard implementation) on HSRC’s acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility (co-primary outcomes). Assessments will occur at the start, middle, and end of one school year. The assessment at the end of the school year will also include a concurrent mixed-methods approach (QUAL + QUAN), guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), to evaluate the school-to-school mentoring strategy. For quantitative outcomes, a generalized linear model framework will be used to evaluate HSRC and the school-to-school mentoring strategy. Discussion This study’s innovative dual randomized design allows for rigorous assessment of HSRC on effectiveness outcomes and the evaluation of a school-to-school mentoring implementation strategy on implementation outcomes. If both HSRC and the school-to-school mentoring strategy have their hypothesized effect, we will be well positioned to address cardiovascular and other chronic disease risk factors among youth using a scalable, widely used approach within one of the largest health educator networks in the country.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Informed consent is a legal and ethical prerequisite for elective procedures such as total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, standard informed consent forms often lack evidence-based content and do not adequately support informed decision-making. The aim was to develop and pilot test an evidence-based informed consent form for TKA. Methods We conducted a two-phase study. In Phase 1, we developed an extended, evidence-based informed consent form for TKA, as well as a corresponding form for anaesthesia, based on systematic evidence syntheses, expert reviews, and standards outlined in the Guideline Evidence-based Health Information . We also developed an e-learning program to train clinicians in the appropriate use of informed consent forms. In addition, we developed a multiple-choice test to assess patients’ knowledge and risk perception. In Phase 2, we piloted the informed consent forms with potential patients through think-aloud interviews and focus groups, assessing their acceptability, usability and comprehensibility with iterative revisions. The multiple-choice test was also piloted and revised. Qualitative data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results We developed evidence-based informed consent forms for TKA and anaesthesia. Content and risk communication follow the Guideline Evidence-based Health Information and meet legal requirements under German law. Benefits and complications were presented using natural frequencies and visualised with bar charts. The forms were piloted in six think-aloud and three focus group interviews with 17 participants. Feedback from participants and experts highlighted the need for revisions in the presentation of numerical data, terminology, structure and layout, which were addressed iteratively. Overall, the forms were rated as understandable, relevant and helpful, though individual information needs varied. The 12-item multiple-choice knowledge test was revised to improve clarity and was perceived as comprehensible and applicable. The e-learning programme includes videos, texts and interactive elements, and is designed for flexible use over 90 to 180 min. Conclusions The informed consent forms are now available. Evidence-based informed consent forms are feasible and perceived by patients as helpful and understandable. The variety of patients’ information needs underlines the need for personalised counselling and structural adjustments in clinical practice so that the potential of evidence-based informed consent forms can be exploited.",

    "Abstract": "This study is one of the few contextual and integrative empirical studies examining how artificial intelligence marketing efforts (AI MEs) can shape consumers' green purchasing behavior (GPB), particularly among Generation Z consumers in developing countries, and thus contribute to green consumption and brand element relationships. This study investigates the direct and mediating effects of both AI MEs (information, customisation, interaction, and accessibility) and brand elements (brand preference, brand experience, and brand trust) on consumers' GPBs based on the SOR model. An analysis based on surveys (n = 609; SEM-ANN) revealed that AI MEs significantly affected brand elements and GPB, and that brand experience and brand preference were significant mediators in the relationship between AI MEs and GPB. The study also found a significant relationship between brand elements and GPB in the present study. The ANN analysis showed that the most important variables in explaining GPB were brand preference, AI MEs, and brand experience. By integrating AI marketing and brand elements into the conceptualisation of GPB, this study contextually enriches and integrates the limited body of knowledge on sustainable consumer behaviour. The findings offer new theoretical insights and practical guidance for policymakers and businesses aiming to leverage AI to promote environmentally responsible consumption.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective Moyamoya disease (MMD) is a rare cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid artery, with an abnormal vascular network forming as compensation. The etiology of MMD remains largely unknown, though genetic and immune factors have been implicated. This study aimed to investigate the landscape of peripheral immune cells in MMD patients using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to identify potential biomarkers and mechanisms involved in the disease. Methods Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from six MMD patients and three controls. scRNA-seq was performed to analyze the transcriptomic profiles of various immune cell populations. Differential gene expression, functional enrichment, and cell interaction analyses were conducted to identify significant alterations in immune cell subpopulations. Additionally, trajectory analysis was used to explore the differentiation pathways of monocytes in MMD. Results The study identified significant transcriptional alterations in peripheral immune cells, particularly in monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. Notably, intermediate monocytes (Mono_CD14_CD16) were increased in MMD patients compared to controls. Functional enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of genes related to immune cell activation and signal transduction in MMD. Two previously uncharacterized genes, RETN and TGFBR2, were identified as potential biomarkers. Trajectory analysis suggested that classical monocytes may differentiate into intermediate monocytes in MMD. Cell interaction analysis highlighted the role of Mono_CD14_CD16 cells in mediating immune responses through interactions involving RETN and TGF-β signaling pathways. Conclusions This study provides a comprehensive analysis of peripheral immune cell alterations in MMD, highlighting the involvement of monocyte subpopulations and specific signaling pathways in disease pathogenesis. The findings offer new insights into the immune dysregulation in MMD and suggest potential targets for diagnosis and treatment.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, a new Co(II) complex, abbreviated as [Co(L)(bipy)(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>n</sub> (1) was prepared using cobalt(II) acetate tetrahydrate, 2-((2'-carboxybenzyl)oxy)benzoic acid (H<sub>2</sub>L), and 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy) ligands in a mixture solution of ethanol and water (v: v = 3: 1). The structure of the complex (1) was analyzed by elemental analysis (EA), infrared (IR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TG), and single-crystal X-ray diffraction techniques. The complex (1) crystallizes in the monoclinic space group C2/c, featuring a distorted octahedral [CoO₄N₂] coordination sphere, by two oxygen atoms from the carboxylate groups of two 2-((2'-carboxybenzyl)oxy)benzoate (L) ligands, two oxygen atoms from coordinated water molecules, and two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N2) from a single 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy) ligand. Bridging carboxylate ligands (L) form a 1D chain, which extends into a 2D layer via π-π interactions of the 2,2'-bipyridine ligands (bipy). The DFT calculations of the complex (1) indicates that the HOMO is predominantly distributed on the oxygen and nitrogen atoms bonded to Co(II) ion, but the LUMO is mainly localized around distributed in the six-membered carbon ring adjacent to the Co(II) ion. Electrostatic potential calculation of the complex (1) shows that the regions with higher electrostatic potential are mainly located on the aromatic ring, whilst the lower electrostatic potential regions are primarily located near the oxygen and nitrogen atoms. The electrochemical behavior of the complex (1) was investigated in acetonitrile and 1 mol·L⁻¹ sulfuric acid. In ACN/TBATFB, the complex (1) exhibits a well-defined, predominantly reversible Co(III)/Co(II) redox couple, indicating good electrochemical stability, whereas in 1 mol·L⁻¹ H₂SO₄, a significantly different redox response with enhanced anodic currents and a prominent oxidation peak is observed, arising from the synergistic effect of ligand protonation-oxidation processes and the metal-centered Co(III)/Co(II) redox couple under acidic conditions. The cytotoxicity of the complex (1) and CoCl₂ was evaluated against L02, PANC-1, and MCF7 cell lines using the MTT assay. The complex (1) exhibited lower IC₅₀ values and higher selectivity for cancer cells than CoCl₂, attributable to improved cellular uptake and ROS-mediated oxidative stress, whereas free Co²⁺, which stimulated cell proliferation at low concentrations, the complex (1) showed no growth-inducing effect, highlighting its potential as a cobalt-based anticancer agent.",

    "Abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder characterized by disrupted epidermal barrier function, immune dysregulation, and persistent inflammation. Affecting both children and adults, AD significantly impairs quality of life due to its visible symptoms and associated psychosocial and economic burdens. Traditional treatments such as application of topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, moisturizers and antibiotics, while managing symptoms, often fall short of providing long-term solutions and can lead to adverse effects over time. This review explores innovative approaches to AD management, focusing on the therapeutic potential of the secretome. The secretome, a collection of bioactive molecules secreted by cells, has shown promise in promoting tissue regeneration and modulating immune responses. This study investigates how secretome therapy can restore the integrity of keratinocytes, the primary cells responsible for maintaining the skin barrier, which is severely compromised in AD. Using in vitro AD models, the secretome's potential to reduce inflammation and enhance skin barrier function is evaluated. By targeting the underlying mechanisms of AD, secretome-based therapies could offer a novel approach to treatment, providing both regenerative and anti-inflammatory benefits. The findings from this study may pave the way for more effective, non-invasive treatments that address the root causes of AD, potentially reducing the disease's impact and improving patient outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Rare diseases (i.e., incidence of &lt;1/2000) are individually uncommon, but collectively these 10,000 conditions affect an estimated 473 million people globally, and approximately 70% of rare diseases manifest in childhood. Despite this global impact, 90% of rare diseases lack effective treatment. Treatments for rare diseases are often identified through clinical trials. Identifying parents’ knowledge needs and preferences regarding pediatric rare disease clinical trials is an important aspect of empowering parents, improving clinical research practices, and potentially improving recruitment to these vital trials. The aim of the scoping review is to determine the extent, range, and characteristics of the evidence on the knowledge needs and preferences of parents regarding pediatric rare disease clinical trials. Methods A scoping review will be conducted to identify sources of literature on the topic. A systematic search strategy co-developed with a research librarian will be conducted in six databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycINFO). Gray literature will be searched via Google, Perplexity AI, the ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global database, and relevant rare disease organizational websites. Abstract and full-text screening will be conducted by two reviewers independently. Studies in English will be included regardless of study design, date of publication, or location of study/publication. Study quality will be appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Data will be extracted including study characteristics, population, phenomena under investigation, and knowledge needs and preferences identified. Analysis will involve a descriptive numerical summary and qualitative content analysis. Findings will be presented in evidence tables, and patterns, themes, and gaps across the data will be reported using a narrative approach. Discussion This review will provide an overview of the existing literature regarding parents’ knowledge needs and preferences about pediatric rare disease clinical trials. The findings of this review will inform future research and the development of knowledge translation resources for parents of children with rare diseases.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose This study aimed to comparatively evaluate the therapeutic effects of Autologous Cytokine-Rich Serum (ACRS) and Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) in a rat model of endometriosis, focusing on inflammation, angiogenesis, and myofibroblast activity. Methods A total of 36 adult female Wistar Albino rats were randomly assigned to six groups: healthy control, ACRS-only, PRP-only, endometriosis (EM), EM + ACRS, and EM + PRP. Endometriosis, modeled as lesion formation on the peritoneal wall, was surgically induced in the relevant groups. ACRS and PRP were prepared from autologous blood and administered intraovarianly and intraperitoneally. Lesions were excised for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of TNF-α, IL-6 (inflammation), VEGFA (angiogenesis), and α-SMA (fibrosis). Results Histopathological scores decreased in both EM + ACRS and EM + PRP groups compared to the EM group. ACRS showed stronger anti-inflammatory effects, with lower TNF-α and IL-6 expression. However, ACRS-treated tissues also exhibited elevated VEGFA and α-SMA expression, suggesting increased angiogenesis and stromal activity. Conclusions Both ACRS and PRP showed therapeutic effects. ACRS more effectively suppressed inflammation but may promote lesion stabilization through enhanced angiogenesis and fibrotic remodeling. These findings highlight the complex biological activity of ACRS, which requires further investigation before clinical translation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The management of refractory pleural effusion presents a significant clinical challenge. This study aims to compare the outcomes of thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis (TP) and indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) insertion, focusing on survival, complications, and healthcare utilization, while accounting for baseline performance status. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study in 2024 at a single tertiary care center, enrolling 101 patients with refractory pleural effusion. Patients were allocated to either the IPC group ( n = 72, 71.3%) or the TP group ( n = 29, 28.7%). Primary outcomes included overall survival, length of hospital stay, and total treatment duration. Secondary outcomes were pleurodesis success rate, effusion recurrence, and procedure-related complications. Multivariate analysis was performed to adjust for confounders including age, ECOG performance status, and etiology. Results The IPC group had a significantly shorter median hospital stay (1 day vs. 7 days; p &lt; 0.001). Unadjusted survival was significantly lower in the IPC group compared to the TP group at 12 months (13.3% vs. 62.1%; p &lt; 0.001). However, after adjusting for ECOG performance status and age in a multivariate Cox regression, the treatment modality was no longer an independent predictor of mortality (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.41–1.48; p = 0.45), whereas ECOG score remained a strong predictor (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.32–2.06; p &lt; 0.001). TP achieved a 100% pleurodesis success rate, compared to 25.4% for IPC ( p &lt; 0.001). IPC patients reported less chest pain (13.9% vs. 48.3%; p &lt; 0.001) and bleeding (1.4% vs. 20.7%; p = 0.002). Conclusion A significant trade-off exists between the two procedures. IPC is associated with shorter hospitalization and fewer acute complications, while TP offers definitive effusion control. The observed survival difference in the TP group appears to be driven by the selection of fitter patients with better performance status for the more invasive procedure, rather than a direct therapeutic benefit of talc. Treatment decisions must be individualized, weighing patient prognosis and performance status.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The tumor microenvironment (TME) in breast cancer is shaped by reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and their surrounding stromal populations. Here, we show that breast adipose tissue-derived stromal/stem cells (bASCs) undergo distinct state transitions in response to tumor cues and systemic metabolic status. Using primary bASCs derived from tumor-adjacent and tumor-distant adipose tissues of breast cancer patients with or without obesity, we identify two functionally distinct, tumor-educated stromal phenotypes: a cytokine-rich inflammatory CAF-like (iCAF) state predominating in lean-adjacent bASCs (ln-aT), and a myofibroblastic CAF-like (myCAF) state emerging in obese-adjacent bASCs (ob-aT). Importantly, transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is sufficient to induce myCAF-like reprogramming in obesity-primed bASCs, while interleukin 1 (IL1)-Janus kinase (JAK) signaling promotes iCAF features. Re-analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data of breast cancer samples reveals an increased TGFβ expression across stromal and immune cell types in individuals with obesity. Mechanistically, IL1 receptor blockade (anakinra) or JAK inhibition (AZD1480) reverses both iCAF and myCAF phenotypes and functionally suppresses stromal-driven epithelial-mesenchymal transition as well as cancer stemness in breast cancer cells. These findings establish a mechanistic link between obese cues, stromal plasticity, and breast cancer progression, and reveal IL1/JAK signaling as a tractable axis to therapeutically reprogram the breast cancer stroma.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Prepartum obesity predisposes dairy cows to a higher risk of postpartum metabolic disorder. Volatile fatty acids (VFA) produced through ruminal microbial fermentation of feed substrates serve as a key form of energy for dairy cows. However, the precise mechanisms through which the rumen microbiota promote adipocyte lipid accumulation in obese dairy cows remain to be elucidated. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms by which rumen microbiota regulates prepartum obesity in dairy cows. Results Plasma glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and free fatty acids were greater in obese dairy cows. In the adipose tissue, the triglyceride content and expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis were higher in obese dairy cows. In the liver, the expression of genes involved in gluconeogenesis and lipid synthesis was higher in obese dairy cows. The ruminal total VFA, acetate, and propionate were higher in obese dairy cows compared to normal cows. The 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed that rumen bacteria, including Tidjanibacter inops _ A , Rikenella massiliensis , Papillibacter cinnamivorans , and Parabacteroides merdae , were enriched in the rumen of obese dairy cows. Enrichment of these bacteria promoted carbohydrate degradation and VFA production. The metabolome analysis showed that obese dairy cows had elevated citric acid level in the rumen, which was positively associated with body condition score, body weight, adipocyte diameter, ruminal VFA concentration, and the abundance of VFA-producing bacteria. Conclusions Our results suggest that rumen bacterial flora in prepartum obese dairy cows supply more VFA to the host, which may induce lipid deposition in adipocytes.",

This study aimed to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of schistosomiasis in sub-Saharan African migrants evaluated through a general screening program for imported infectious diseases at a specialized international health unit in Barcelona, Spain. We performed a retrospective observational study (2014–2023) including confirmed (defined by egg detection in stool or urine) and probable cases (identified by positive serology against Schistosoma) . Data on epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up were collected. Among 3214 screened migrants, 855 (26.6%) were diagnosed with schistosomiasis. Most were male (87%) with a median age of 21.9 years, mainly originating from Mali, Gambia, and Senegal. Only 2.2% reported symptoms, while anemia and eosinophilia were observed in 9.7% and 29.7% of cases, respectively. Parasitological confirmation was achieved in 24.9%, with the remainder diagnosed by serology alone. Abdominal ultrasound was performed in 122 patients, revealing abnormalities in 20.4%. Multivariate analysis showed that confirmed cases tended to be younger (22.4 years vs 25.8 years) and had higher frequencies of women (17.8% vs 11.3%), symptoms (5.6% vs 1.1%), eosinophilia (49.4% vs 22.5%), and ultrasound abnormalities (22.7% vs 17.8%) than probable cases. Praziquantel treatment was administered to 775 patients (90.6%). Follow-up information was available for 218 individuals (28.1%); among those, eggs persisted in 7.4% (9/122), and 84% (74/88) maintained positive serology. Schistosomiasis prevalence in this migrant population was high and mostly asymptomatic, with limited laboratory abnormalities but notable radiological findings, particularly in confirmed cases. Serology was useful diagnostically but had limited value in follow-up. Systematic screening of at-risk populations remains crucial for early detection and treatment. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Informal caregivers, frequently family members or close acquaintances, offer uncompensated care and support to individuals with cardiovascular diseases, confronting diverse challenges such as mental stress, financial strain, and the overall burden of care. Addressing these challenges is vital for both caregivers and patients. This systematic review seeks to identify the factors contributing to caregiver burden among informal caregivers of cardiovascular patients. Methods PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, and Science Direct were searched from 2000 until July 2023, following the PRISMA guidelines, to systematically retrieve relevant papers. The review incorporated quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies. Results Forty-two studies were included in the systematic review. Data synthesis adhered to the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodological guidance using a convergent integrated approach. Five categories emerged: individual characteristics (demographic characteristics of the caregiver and patient-related factors), confronting multifaceted tensions (physical problems, mental health problems, and financial burden), role strain in daily life, inadequate health literacy, and lack of support. Conclusion This review underscores that informal caregivers of cardiac patients encounter substantial burdens. These burdens are intensified by challenges, including insufficient knowledge, restricted social support, and suboptimal communication from both family members and healthcare providers, resulting in increased physical and psychological stress. It is crucial to evaluate informal caregivers for these burdens and offer the required support. Clinical implications include routine assessment of caregiver burden, providing tailored educational interventions to enhance health literacy, and offering financial and psychosocial support to mitigate risks specific to cardiovascular disease caregiving.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) triggers precipitation anomalies, which are not evenly distributed across other terrestrial water budget terms, including runoff, evapotranspiration (ET), and terrestrial water storage change (TWSC). This uneven distribution represents a significant knowledge gap. This study addresses this gap by examining the varied responses of these terms to ENSO events across regions of the continental United States where precipitation is significantly influenced. The results highlight distinct patterns that are contingent upon the regional climatic aridity. In more humid regions, ENSO’s impact is primarily evident in runoff dynamics. As aridity levels escalate, the sensitivity of runoff to ENSO diminishes, while the responses of ET and TWSC become more pronounced. In the driest regions, TWSC exhibits the most significant response to ENSO events. These findings underscore the context-dependent nature of ENSO’s hydrological impacts, which is crucial for predicting water resources using the ENSO indices.",

The deflection system consists of a pair of electrodes mounted on an electrostatic analyzer. Our numerical model of the ion optics demonstrates its performance, including deflection efficiency for various parameters, and investigates the empirically known upper limit of deflection efficiency. The results reveal that the deflection system essentially involves canceling the kinetic energy perpendicular to the midplane of the deflectors using the electric potential. This implies that the energy of ions capable of $$\\pm$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mo>±</mml:mo> </mml:math> 45° deflection is limited to approximately twice the applied voltage.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), long used as a selective pulmonary vasodilator, has demonstrated potential antimicrobial and antiviral properties when administered at high concentrations (&gt; 20 parts per million, ppm). While definitive evidence is still lacking, this narrative review synthesizes the emerging clinical and mechanistic properties supporting high-dose iNO as a potential therapeutic strategy for lower respiratory tract infections, including drug-resistant bacterial pneumonias, COVID-19, nontuberculous mycobacteria, and bronchiolitis. We summarize safety data from laboratory studies, Phase I trials, clinical findings from 27 predominantly early-phase studies, and highlight its as both hospital-based and home-based therapy. High-dose iNO acts through multiple pathways, including direct microbial killing, biofilm disruption, immune modulation, and mucociliary enhancement, and holds promise in addressing unmet needs in respiratory infection management. We also propose a roadmap for future research to optimize dosing, delivery, and efficacy endpoints in well-defined patient populations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Social anxiety is prevalent amongst university students. Cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT), and graded exposure techniques in particular, is an effective intervention for social anxiety. However, there are a number of barriers preventing the delivery of CBT to students who are socially anxious. Delivering this intervention using virtual reality (VR) can address these implementation issues. We have co-developed with a group of students a VR-CBT intervention (UniVRse) specifically for members of this student group with social anxiety. Methods/design The present study is a pilot randomised controlled trial conducted in the United Kingdom of the UniVRse intervention compared to a wait-list control group. The aim of the trial is to determine whether a definitive trial is justified by assessing study recruitment, retention, and acceptability, as well as establishing the effect size on the co-primary outcomes for the definitive trial sample size calculation. We aim to recruit 90 socially anxious students—45 in each trial arm. The trial will adopt a mixed-methods approach. We will collect quantitative data at baseline (T0) and post-intervention 6 weeks later (T1). We will invite participants randomised to the intervention arm to complete a qualitative exit interview. Discussion The results of this pilot trial will be used to determine whether a definitive trial is justified, and to inform the refinement of the UniVRse programme and trial procedures. In the longer term, the UniVRse intervention has the potential to be an effective and accessible psychological intervention for students with social anxiety.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Low participation in risky financial markets limits households’ access to higher returns and reduces market efficiency. While fintech offers opportunities to diversify portfolios, limited participation remains prevalent, particularly in developing countries such as China. Using data from the China Household Finance Survey, with a sample of 124,565 households, this study explores whether fintech can mitigate this problem. By applying a probit model and addressing endogeneity through a quasi-experimental design and instrumental variables, along with robustness checks using variable replacements and model substitutions, the findings reveal that fintech significantly increases participation in risky financial markets. A 1% increase in fintech, as measured by the China Digital Financial Inclusion Index, increases the probability of participation by 0.206 percentage points. The relationship is moderated by social interactions and financial literacy: a 1-unit increase in social interactions is associated with a 0.096 increase in the marginal relationship between fintech and participation, whereas a 1-unit increase in financial literacy is associated with a 0.047 decrease. Additionally, the relationship is heterogeneous, varying by household and regional characteristics. This study highlights the role of fintech in enhancing household participation and underscores the moderating roles of social capital and human capital. These findings have implications for the digital divide and offer practical recommendations for individuals, financial institutions, and governments, including developing social investment platforms, promoting inclusive financial education, and incentivizing fintech services in underserved areas.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background School victimization during adolescence is a multidimensional phenomenon that affects psychological well-being and social development. Understanding its underlying factors is essential for designing effective preventive strategies. Objective This study aims to analyze school victimization in adolescents from a psychosocial perspective, proposing an explanatory model that integrates individual variables (psychological distress, life satisfaction, and resilience) and social variables (community social support). Method The total of participants was 1,687 adolescents (46% male, 54% female) aged 12–17 years (M = 13.65, SD = 1.14), from 13 schools in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Results Psychological distress is positively associated with school victimization, while life satisfaction is negatively associated. Furthermore, community social support and resilience were found to indirectly influence school victimization through life satisfaction and, negatively, through psychological distress. Multigroup analysis revealed differences in victimization dynamics by gender, although the model is invariant. Conclusion The findings highlight the importance of adopting a multidimensional perspective in understanding and addressing school victimization. Promoting resilience and strengthening community social support could reduce the risk of victimization and improve students' psychological well-being. These results have practical implications for the development of comprehensive prevention and intervention strategies in school settings.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Discomfort perceived by patients during an intensive care unit (ICU) stay may limit their function, well-being, and quality of life after their stay. This study creates a comprehensive questionnaire (EXPRIM) able to distinguish and quantify the recollection of discomfort and emotional suffering experienced during a stay in an ICU stay, and to assess its performance. Method The measurement properties of the questionnaire were tested in a first sample of 50 patients recruited between February and July 2024 in a tertiary ICU, using internal consistency, test-retest reliability, standard error of measurement (SEM), and construct validity. Content validity was also tested, in a second sample of 20 patients and 10 ICU healthcare providers recruited between April and June 2024 in a regional ICU, using face-to-face qualitative interviews based on a semi-structured interview guide assessing comprehensibility, relevance and comprehensiveness of the instruction and items. Results EXPRIM is a 30-item questionnaire developed in French and translated in English. Its total score ranges from 0 to 10, reflecting the weighting of discomfort versus suffering. The internal consistency was very good (Cronbach’s alpha coefficient 0.81). The intra- and inter-examinator reliabilities were excellent (Intraclass Coefficient Correlation = 0.875 and 0.858, respectively). SEM ranged from −0.071 to 0.035. Good correlations were found between EXPRIM and other questionnaires measuring similar concepts. There was good evidence of content validity to explore recollection of the ICU stay. Conclusions The EXPRIM questionnaire is a new tool with excellent psychometric properties to quantitatively assess the ICU experiences survivors recall after discharge. It is a promising tool to explore the extent of discomfort and emotional suffering during an ICU stay and to compare experiences between patients or populations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We analyse the historical relationship between consumer prices and wages in Switzerland. Our results show that, between 1980 and 2019, the pass-through from prices to wages was substantial. At the same time, nominal wage increases only had a modest effect on prices. Other factors—such as imported inflation, inflation expectations and economic slack—clearly dominate wages in explaining price movements in Switzerland. Second-round effects of inflation, in turn, are mainly explained by inflation expectations. Our results suggest that the pass-through from wages to prices could be higher in an environment of elevated inflation. However, even in the 1980s and 1990s, the pass-through was only modest. It follows that periods of simultaneously high inflation and high wage growth were not the result of a wage-price spiral. Instead, the long-term comovement of the two variables can mostly be explained by common drivers (e.g. inflation expectations, economic slack) and by the gradual adjustment of wages to prices.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare, multisystemic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease. Carotid artery dissections involving both the cervical internal carotid artery and common carotid artery are rare. To our knowledge, there are no previous reports of cervical carotid artery dissections associated with EGPA. This is the first report of spontaneous cervical artery dissection involving the common and internal carotid arteries associated with EGPA. Case presentation A 64-year-old woman with a history of EGPA presented with Horner syndrome. She was receiving glucocorticoids for EGPA and anticoagulation therapy for atrial fibrillation. Ultrasonography demonstrated an intimal flap and double lumen within the common carotid artery and internal carotid artery. The patient was followed up with continued medications. No ischemic stroke occurred, and Horner syndrome had improved at 6 month visit after onset. Ultrasonography showed no recurrence or aneurysm formation, but complete resolution of carotid artery dissections has not yet been confirmed. Conclusions This case suggests a possible association between EGPA and carotid artery dissections. In such cases, an underlying disease involving endothelial dysfunction should be investigated. Clinicians should consider underlying systemic vasculitis such as EGPA in cases of atypical or extensive cervical artery dissections.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a critical component in many privacy-preserving systems, and Batch PIR schemes constructed by Probabilistic Batch Code have garnered widespread attention in both academia and industry due to their relatively low average computational cost. However, existing Batch PIR still face challenges in balancing computational and communication efficiency, while some also exhibit poor adaptability to databases of large entries. In this paper, building upon the state-of-the-art Batch PIR schemes, we employ two approaches to enhance their overall performance.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Deploying unsupervised anomaly detection systems in heterogeneous smart home environments is hindered by the need for costly, per-site hyperparameter tuning. This paper addresses the critical challenge of hyperparameter transferability for creating zero-tune, plug-and-play security solutions. We systematically evaluate five unsupervised machine learning models [Elliptic Envelope (EE), Isolation Forest (IF), Local Outlier Factor (LoF), One-Class SVM (oSVM), and an Autoencoder (AE)] across five prominent IoT datasets. Using a rigorous dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning approach, we benchmark the performance of transferred configurations against both per-dataset optimization and default settings. Our findings establish a clear performance hierarchy: while dataset-specific tuning remains the gold standard, an intelligent transfer strategy significantly outperforms default configurations. Notably, we identify the IoTID20 dataset as the most effective source. Our quantitative topological analysis supports this, revealing that IoTID20’s high feature space complexity and cluster overlap (evidenced by low Silhouette scores) create a rigorous training environment that produces robust, portable hyperparameters. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strategic trade-off: Autoencoders and LoF deliver the highest absolute performance, whereas IF offers the most substantial improvement over default settings. This work provides a quantitative framework for dataset-driven initialization, guiding the development of robust, low-maintenance intrusion detection systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Golgi apparatus orchestrates post-translational modification and vesicular trafficking, with guanosine diphosphatases (GDPases) facilitating nucleotide-sugar transport by hydrolyzing guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to guanosine monophosphate (GMP). Although GDPase functions are well known in yeast and human-pathogenic fungi, their roles in filamentous fungi, including plant pathogens, remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the biological functions of the Golgi GDPases Gda1 and Ynd1 in the wheat head blight pathogen Fusarium graminearum . While loss of FgYND1 only resulted in minor growth problems, deletion of FgGDA1 caused pleiotropic deficiencies in mycelial development, conidiation, sexual reproduction, and virulence. Notably, FgYND1 overexpression partially rescued the defects of the FgGDA1 deletion mutant in the developmental and invasive processes, indicating overlapping yet non-equivalent functions. Glycoproteomics analysis revealed global remodeling of glycoprotein profiles in the FgGDA1 deletion mutant, with prominent changes among enzymes in carbon metabolism, consistent with disrupted Golgi-dependent glycosylation. According to our results, FgGda1 is the primary driver of protein glycosylation-dependent fungal development and virulence in F. graminearum , with FgYnd1 providing only partial redundancy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Adaptations are expected when complex public health interventions are implemented in dynamically and rapidly changing real-world settings. Systematic documentation of adaptations to intervention components and strategies are critical when assessing their impact on implementation. The purpose of this paper is to describe our approach to systematically tracking, documenting, and evaluating adaptations made during the CO-CREATE-Ex project, which aimed to address COVID-19 testing disparities in the San Ysidro US/Mexico border community. Methods The study utilized a longitudinal, prospective, multi- method approach to systematically document and assess adaptations across the pre-implementation, early and mid/late-implementation, and maintenance phases of the project. Adaptations were aggregated from a combination of sources (i.e., meeting notes, Advisory Board transcripts, and periodic reflections). Adaptations were entered weekly into an electronic database that captured information on 16 characteristics and were validated by study staff. Descriptive statistics were used to describe adaptation characteristics. Adaptation impact was evaluated using a combination of objective and subjective measures aligned with the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) outcomes. Results Eighty-four unique adaptations were included in this analysis. Adaptations were organized by study phase with most occurring during pre-implementation. Most adaptations ( n = 79, 94.04%) were planned (i.e., proactive) and expected ( n = 63, 75%), and ( n = 21, 25.0%) adaptations were considered unexpected (e.g., reactive). Across all adaptations, 71.2% were perceived as positive (i.e., had a positive impact on RE-AIM implementation outcomes) and 19.1% were perceived to be negative (i.e., worsened implementation outcome or decreased implementation). Unexpected adaptations, though reactive in nature, generally had a positive impact on implementation outcomes. For instance, 14.3% of unexpected adaptations were perceived to increase reach and effectiveness. Within maintenance, 19% of unexpected adaptations were perceived to increase this outcome. Lastly, adaptations were generally small in scope with less than a tenth of adaptations affecting 50% or more of core elements. Conclusion Our systematic approach to documenting and analyzing adaptations has highlighted the importance of understanding the impact of adaptations on implementation outcomes. These insights underscore the need for continued research to refine methods for adaptation documentation and impact evaluation, ensuring interventions remain effective, equitable, and responsive to real-world challenges.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Digital entrepreneurship has significantly transformed the global business landscape, and it is a thriving field at the intersection of traditional entrepreneurial practices and digital innovation. The objective of the research is to illustrate a comprehensive, systematic, and bibliometric analysis of the themes, influential contributions, evaluation and future directions in digital entrepreneurship research. This study has analyzed 959 publications from the Scopus Database, which incorporates a span of 30 years (1993 to 2023), experimenting with multiple bibliometric tools, i.e., RStudio and VOSviewer. In particular, the full range of the performance analysis and science-mapping techniques, such as co-authorship, co-citation and keyword co-occurrence networks are utilized with the help of these two software to demonstrate the impactful contributions and the structure of themes in digital entrepreneurship studies. The analysis depicts strong geographical clustering of the digital entrepreneurship research productivity and collaboration. It also demonstrates an opportunity of global involvement in the academic field. The findings reveal the escalating scholarly attention in the field of Digital Entrepreneurship, propelled by the integration of digital technologies in ongoing digital transformation and business processes catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic. In spite of the considerable breakthroughs, this study recognizes substantial gaps in the existing literature and particularly the need for inclusive theoretical frameworks. The results offer theoretical contribution by identifying technology-enabled business model innovation as the central conceptual foundation. They also provide practical insights by outlining promising directions for policymakers and entrepreneurs. The future research approaches are recommended, emphasizing the necessity of reconnoitering under-researched areas, i.e., the role of digital entrepreneurship in sustainable progress, cross-cultural comparisons, and the impact of emerging technologies. This research delivers a valuable perception for practitioners and scholars and also guides them through the transforming landscape of digital entrepreneurship and illustrates the critical role in progressive business standards.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract By integrating Conservation of Resources (COR) Theory and Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study investigates how psychological resilience affects employees’ intentions to change careers and further clarifies the dual relationship between psychological resilience and career change intentions. We analyze the direct impact of resilience on career change intention, the mediating effect of career satisfaction, and whether a perceived lack of job alternatives moderates this relationship. Data were collected from 204 full-time white-collar employees in Türkiye. The findings show that psychological resilience positively predicts career change intention, suggesting that resilient individuals are more open to pursuing new career paths. Additionally, psychological resilience boosts career satisfaction, which subsequently decreases employees’ intentions to switch careers, confirming a significant indirect (mediated) effect. However, the perceived lack of options does not moderate the resilience–career change relationship. These findings clarify the dual role of psychological resilience and provide practical insights for organizations seeking to understand and influence employees’ career choices.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives Despite the well-documented link between action video game playing and enhanced visual perception, there is a lack of sufficient studies exploring auditory abilities. The purpose of this study is to compare temporal processing and auditory memory abilities between individuals who play action video games and those with little to no video game experience. Methods The study included 39 action video game players and 35 individuals with little to no video game experience. Participants underwent the Frequency Pattern Test (FPT), Duration Pattern Test (DPT), and Random Gap Detection Test to assess their temporal auditory processing skills. The Digit Span Test and Reverse Digit Span Test were used to evaluate auditory memory capacity. Independent sample t-tests or Mann–Whitney U tests were used for group comparisons. Results No significant differences were observed between the action video game players and non-players in the Frequency Pattern Test (69.74 ± 15.55 vs 68.85 ± 17.70; p &gt; 0.05), Duration Pattern Test (84.35 ± 14.69 vs 86.71 ± 13.71; p &gt; 0.05), Random Gap Detection Test (7.16 ± 4.90 vs 8.91 ± 7.21; p &gt; 0.05), Digit Span Test (5.56 ± 0.71 vs 5.51 ± 0.98; p &gt; 0.05), or Reverse Digit Span Test (3.94 ± 0.81 vs 3.60 ± 0.82; p = 0.05). Conclusion Our results indicate that auditory abilities do not show enhancement in action video game players. Further research is needed to evaluate the potential of video games as an intervention tool, especially for individuals who experience difficulties with auditory processing.",

    "Abstract": "Since its introduction into medical terminology by Lord Henry Cohen in 1941, the term “neurapraxia” has become established in the neurological and neurosurgical lexicon, although it is often misused or misspelled. It denotes a transient dysfunction of a peripheral nerve, as distinct from axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which describe more significant structural injuries to a peripheral nerve. To expand our understanding of neurapraxia, it is necessary to examine the phenomenon in both temporal and spatial contexts. This study examines neurapraxia in: (A) Time—(1) the origins of the term neurapraxia and (2) the time-course of a neurapraxic injury and its recovery, and (B) Space—(3) the microstructure of a neurapraxic injury and (4) the locations of neurapraxic injuries within the peripheral nervous system. We demonstrate that the term neurapraxia encompasses both a temporal and a spatial definition. In time, it applies to transient peripheral nerve palsy, from which recovery occurs before there is sufficient time for axonal regeneration, typically within a few weeks. In space, there is a histopathological change limited to localized demyelination in nerves lined by epineurium and myelinated by Schwann cells. Nerves distal to the spine qualify as nerves to which the term neurapraxia can apply; however, cranial nerves and spinal nerve roots (including cauda equina) are inconsistent with this owing to the variability in myelinating cells along their course (oligodendroglia proximally, i.e., central glial segment), the absence of an epineurial covering, and exposure to cerebrospinal fluid.",

    "Abstract": "The Hippo signaling pathway is conventionally known to restrict tissue growth in animals. Genetic studies have also shown that loss of Hippo pathway components leads to defects in asymmetric cell division in Drosophila neural stem cells, known as neuroblasts. The hallmark of neuroblast division is the asymmetric localization of aPKC/Bazooka (Par3)/Par6 complex, termed the Par complex, to the apical cell cortex. However, the localization of the Hippo pathway components in neuroblasts remains unknown. Here, we report that two key activators of the Hippo pathway, Kibra and Salvador, polarize to the apical cortex of mitotic neuroblasts. We show that apical polarity, via the activity of aPKC, and F-actin dynamics synergize to drive Kibra polarization. Together, these results provide further insights into the relationship between apical polarity and Hippo pathway organization and suggest a possible mechanism by which pathway activity is regulated during neuroblast asymmetric division.",

    "Abstract": "It has been shown that changes in plant flowering times are directly tied to climate change, often being the first and most visible indicators of broader, ecosystem-wide change. Despite this, tropical latitudes have been markedly understudied. We analyzed 19 tropical species across seven locations from 1960 to 2021. Through a series of Bayesian regression analyses of flowering date on maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation, we found that flowering dates of tropical plants have changed substantially with changes in climate. Flowering dates have shifted an average of 6.9 days per °C of maximum temperature change, 4.5 days per °C of minimum temperature change, and 0.28 days per mm precipitation. We then computed combined effects of the aforementioned climate variables and found that flowering dates have shifted 15.0 days per unit of combined temperature and precipitation changes (computed as the sum of products of standardized changes in climate variables and their posterior effect estimates). We found no meaningful difference in magnitude of change in flowering of species in consistently hot and wet locations to those in locations with seasonal wet and dry periods (Wilcoxon rank sum p&amp;gt;0.05). Our study demonstrates tropical ecosystems are not insulated from the impacts of climate change.",

    "Abstract": "<ns3:p> Background Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 are increasingly used in scientific writing, yet little is known about how AI-generated scientific titles are perceived by researchers in terms of quality. Objective To compare the perceived alignment with the abstract content (as a surrogate for perceived accuracy), appeal, and overall preference for AI-generated versus human-written scientific titles. Methods We conducted a blinded comparative study with 21 researchers from diverse academic backgrounds. A random sample of 50 original titles was selected from 10 high-impact general internal medicine journals. For each title, an alternative version was generated using GPT-4.0. Each rater evaluated 50 pairs of titles, each pair consisting of one original and one AI-generated version, without knowing the source of the titles or the purpose of the study. For each pair, raters independently assessed both titles on perceived alignment with the abstract content and appeal, and indicated their overall preference. We analyzed alignment and appeal using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and mixed-effects ordinal logistic regressions, preferences using McNemar’s test and mixed-effects logistic regression, and inter-rater agreement with Gwet’s AC. Results AI-generated titles received significantly higher ratings for both perceived alignment with the abstract content (mean 7.9 vs. 6.7, <ns3:italic>p-value</ns3:italic> &lt;0.001) and appeal (mean 7.1 vs. 6.7, <ns3:italic>p-value</ns3:italic> &lt;0.001) than human-written titles. The odds of preferring an AI-generated title were 1.7 times higher ( <ns3:italic>p-value</ns3:italic> =0.001), with 61.8% of 1,049 paired judgments favoring the AI version. Inter-rater agreement was moderate to substantial (Gwet’s AC: 0.54–0.70). Conclusions AI-generated titles were rated more favorably than human-written titles within the context of this study in terms of perceived alignment with the abstract content, appeal, and preference, suggesting that LLMs may enhance the effectiveness of scientific communication. These findings support the responsible integration of AI tools in research. </ns3:p>",

The study aimed to gather teachers’ perspectives on their perceptions of motivation, skills, values, and attitudes following the training program. The participants engaged in three cycles of training development programs. This study will regard the levels of the Kirkpatrick model as equivalent, without any hierarchical distinction. Method The research employed a quantitative design utilising a longitudinal approach. The three stages of Kirkpatrick assessment were utilised to assess the program’s impacts, progressing from level 1 to level 3. The data is gathered by a survey method with a Likert-scale questionnaire. A total of 944 educators engaged in this survey. They originated from 34 provinces in Indonesia. The data was evaluated utilising percentage data analysis. Result The results indicated that, across level 1 - reaction, level 2 - skill, and level 3 - values and attitudes, the majority of participants fell within the positive spectrum (strongly agree and agree). The level of concordance among all assessed indices exceeded 90%. The conducted training programs were highly acceptable to the majority of participants. The participants believe that the training significantly enhances their motivation and skills, positively influencing their values and attitudes. Conclusion The results indicate that the programs had significant effects on the participants. Such initiatives should not be executed as one-time interventions but rather as components of a continuous, systematic strategy designed to enhance vocational teachers’ competencies over time.</ns3:p>",

    "Abstract": "<ns3:p>Background During the COVID-19 pandemic, the legal system was temporarily restructured to adhere to the recommended disease mitigation strategies. However, the pandemic also exacerbated the prevalence and intensity of intimate partner violence, especially among Black women. This led to Black women IPV survivors having to engage with the restructured legal system as a method of formal support to navigate their relationships. Through an intersectional lens, this study explores how Black women IPV survivors navigated the legal system amid the service disruptions of the global pandemic. Methods In the first half of 2021, 50 Black women IPV survivors who were engaged with domestic violence organizations were purposively recruited to participate in a one-time, semi-structured qualitative interview. Findings were analyzed using a combined thematic and interpretative phenomenological analysis. Findings Two themes emerged as Black women IPV survivors discussed their experiences with the legal system during the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) failed protection from lack of granted protective orders and (2) ineffective legal proceedings. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic made it increasingly challenging for Black women IPV survivors to engage with the legal system. Black women IPV survivors recounted receipts of inadequate services regrind protective orders, a lack of knowledge regarding IPV from court officials, the emotional and mental toll from engaging with the legal system, limited staffing and resources from law enforcement, and extended court procedures. Implications for intersectional and survivor-centered policies, programs, and research are discussed to mitigate or prevent the harm that Black women IPV survivors experience from a system meant to protect them.</ns3:p>",

    "Abstract": "<ns3:p>Background Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of heatwaves across South Asia, with disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations. Pregnant and lactating women face heightened health risks due to physiological changes, gendered social responsibilities, and constrained access to adaptive resources. Despite this, women's lived experiences and adaptation practices during pregnancy remain understudied and largely absent from institutional climate responses. This knowledge gap hampers the development of effective, gender-sensitive adaptation policies. Methods This qualitative study, embedded within the Heat in Pregnancy (HiP)-India project, will be conducted in three climatically vulnerable locations—Gurugram (Haryana), Bilaspur (Chhattisgarh), and Puducherry. Using a socio-ecological framework, we will conduct in-depth interviews with pregnant and lactating women, focus group discussions with family caregivers, and key informant interviews with health workers and local officials, alongside non-participant observations. Interviews will be conducted during and shortly after the heat season to capture both real-time and reflective experiences. We will use purposive sampling to recruit approximately 20–25 women per site, with additional caregivers and stakeholders. Recruitment will occur primarily through PHCs; if community-based recruitment is not feasible, we will clearly position PHC users as our study population. Where possible, frontline workers will support outreach to women who may have limited facility access. Data will be thematically analysed in NVivo, and reporting will follow the COREQ checklist. Anticipated Results The study will generate contextualised insights into women’s heat-adaptation practices during pregnancy and lactation across diverse agro-climatic zones, document traditional and emerging coping strategies, and identify structural, social, and institutional barriers shaping adaptation capacity. Conclusion By centering women's lived experiences, this research will inform the design of culturally appropriate, gender-responsive heat adaptation interventions suitable for low-resource settings. Findings will support both practical community-based solutions and evidence-based advocacy for more inclusive climate adaptation policies at local and national levels.</ns3:p>",

    "Abstract": "<ns3:p>Diet plays an important role in healthy development in adolescence and later in life. We described quantitative and qualitative data regarding food and dietary behaviour in the 2023/24 and 2024/25 rounds of ‘Born in Bradford: Age of Wonder’, a longitudinal study of secondary school pupils in Years 8, 9 and 10 across Bradford district. Particular attention is given to fruit and vegetable intake, breakfast and fast-food consumption and consumption of energy and high-sugar drinks. 13,143 students aged 12–15 completed questions on food and dietary behaviour (median age 13.9 years; 36.9.% Pakistani heritage; 33.4% White British; 59.7% living in the most deprived quintile). Overall, 19.4% of participants ate two or more servings of fruit daily; 20.3% ate two or more servings of vegetables daily; breakfast was eaten every day by 38.9% of participants; 1.7% of respondents ate fast food every day; 9.7% of participants consumed sugary drinks every day and 6.1% consumed energy drinks every day. Notable sub-group differences were present, for example, female and older participants reported less frequent breakfast consumption compared to their male and younger counterparts, while Pakistani participants reported more daily consumption of fast foods compared to White British participants. Qualitative data suggest that adolescent diet is shaped by an interplay of peer norms, cultural food practices, parental influence and affordability.</ns3:p>",

    "Abstract": "Parasites represent a major constraint in pond-based aquaculture, as their presence can lead to substantial fish mortality and associated economic losses. This study investigated the extent of Argulus infestation in cultured common carp (Cyprinus carpio) reared in a freshwater hatchery in South Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Two host groups were examined: broodstock (n = 60; 1091.2 ± 58.16 g) and fingerlings (n = 150; 19.6 ± 0.82 g). Identification of Argulus specimens was conducted using morphological examination complemented by molecular analyses. Parasite prevalence and mean intensity were quantified, and Spearman's rank correlation was applied to determine the relationship between fish body weight and infestation severity. Both morphological and molecular evidence confirmed that the Argulus specimens infesting carp in this study were Argulus foliaceus. Fish body weight was significantly correlated with infestation intensity (P < 0.01), with broodstock exhibiting markedly higher prevalence and mean intensity than fingerlings. Preferred attachment sites differed between life stages: the base of the pectoral fins in broodstock and the body surface in fingerlings. These findings indicate that host life stage and body size strongly influence the severity and spatial pattern of A. foliaceus infestations in common carp. The outcomes provide a scientific basis for developing management guidelines to reduce the incidence and spread of Argulus in aquaculture systems.",

    "Abstract": "Digital content platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch rely on third-party providers and share advertising revenue to incentivize content production. Yet, as providers increasingly distribute content across multiple platforms, competition intensifies and platforms consider exclusive contracts to restrict providers’ multihoming behavior. Our research develops an analytical model to examine when exclusive contracts benefit or harm platforms, providers, consumers, and overall welfare. We find that exclusivity has two key forces: it limits the number of providers on each platform, reducing same-side crowding, but it also weakens the effectiveness of revenue sharing as a competitive tool for attracting providers. As a result, exclusivity benefits platforms only when consumers place low marginal value on content, leading platforms to offer lower sharing rates and earn higher profits. When consumer valuation is high, exclusivity can backfire, reducing platform profits. Importantly, exclusivity can increase provider surplus and even generate win–win outcomes for both platforms and providers at intermediate valuation levels. Although exclusivity reduces consumer surplus because of fewer providers, total social welfare may still increase because of reduced competition costs among providers. These findings suggest policymakers should take a nuanced stance toward regulating content exclusivity.",

    "Abstract": "Aims The biomechanical effects of varying rotator cuff tear severities on medialized versus lateralized reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) remain unclear. This study aimed to compare medialized and lateralized RTSA designs based on subscapularis integrity and the severity of posterosuperior cuff tears. Methods A total of 12 human in vivo experimental datasets were collected during external rotation (ER) from a neutral position to 45°, with the elbow fixed at 90° and the palm facing inward. These datasets were used as inputs for musculoskeletal shoulder models of both medialized and lateralized RTSA. Inverse dynamic simulations were conducted under two subscapularis conditions—repaired (all bundles intact) and torn (all bundles torn)—across three stages of posterosuperior cuff tear severity. The scapular notching-related impingement stress, joint subluxation, and muscle-tendon forces were compared between the two RTSA configurations. Results Subscapularis repair in lateralized RTSA led to greater reductions in impingement stress (16.7% to 26.2%; p &lt; 0.05) and joint subluxation (27.5% to 58.9%; p &lt; 0.001) compared to medialized RTSA (14.1% to 18.6%; p &lt; 0.05 and 14.7% to 22.4%; p &lt; 0.001, respectively) across all posterosuperior cuff tear conditions. Additionally, with subscapularis repair, posterior deltoid force increased more markedly with tear severity in lateralized RTSA (from 2.6% (p = 0.007) to 918.5% (p &lt; 0.001)) than in medialized RTSA (from 4.7% to 784.5%, both p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Lateralizing RTSA and repairing the subscapularis can significantly reduce scapular notching-related impingement, improve joint stability, and support ER torque generation by increasing posterior deltoid force in patients with posterosuperior cuff tears. These findings provide critical insights for surgical planning, supporting the use of a lateralized implant and subscapularis repair to reduce the risk of scapular notching and joint subluxation while enhancing ER torque generation.

    "Abstract": "In drug discovery and therapeutic research, the prediction of drug-disease associations (DDAs) holds significant scientific and clinical value. Drug molecules exert their effects by precisely identifying disease-related biological targets, systematically modulating the entire pharmacological process from absorption, distribution, and metabolism to final efficacy. Accurate prediction of drug-disease associations not only facilitates an in-depth understanding of molecular mechanisms of drug action but also provides critical theoretical foundations for drug repositioning and personalized medicine. While traditional prediction methods based on in vitro experiments and clinical statistics yield reliable results, they suffer from inherent drawbacks such as long development cycles, substantial resource consumption, and low throughput. In contrast, emerging machine learning techniques offer a promising solution to these bottlenecks, enabling the intelligent and efficient discovery of potential drug–disease association networks and significantly improving drug development efficiency. However, it is noteworthy that existing machine learning methods still face significant challenges in practical applications: the complexity of feature construction raises the threshold for data processing; data sparsity constrains the depth of information mining; and the pervasive issue of sample imbalance poses a severe challenge to the model’s predictive accuracy and generalization performance. In this study, we developed an efficient and accurate framework for drug-disease association prediction named FKSUDDAPre. The model employs a multi-modal feature fusion strategy: on one hand, it leverages an ensemble of Mol2vec and K- BERT to deeply capture the semantic features of drug molecular fingerprints; on the other hand, it integrates Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) with DeepWalk to effectively reduce the dimensionality of disease features while preserving their relational structure. To address the class imbalance problem, FKSUDDAPre designed an optimization algorithm called AMDKSU, which combined clustering with an improved distance metric strategy, significantly enhancing the discriminative power of the sample set. For data processing, F-test was employed for feature importance ranking, effectively reducing data dimensionality and improving model generalization. For the predictive architecture, FKSUDDAPre proposed a novel ensemble framework composed of XGBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and HyperFast. By employing a dynamic weight allocation strategy, this ensemble effectively harnesses the complementary strengths of these models to achieve significantly enhanced predictive performance. Rigorous validation demonstrated the system’s outstanding performance across multiple evaluation metrics, with an average AUC of 0.9725, improving the AUC by approximately 3.88% compared to the best-performing baseline model. In the prediction of Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, 80% and 60% of the top 10 candidate drugs recommended by FKSUDDAPre, respectively, had been confirmed by literature, demonstrating the model’s good practical application potential. Furthermore, we conducted a LIME-based feature importance analysis on the model’s predictions, visualizing the correlations between features and the target variable to demonstrate the model’s interpretability. A cross-platform, user-friendly visualization tool had also been developed using the PyQt5 framework.",

    "Abstract": "Stroke rehabilitation in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) faces persistent gaps in mental health service integration. Post-stroke depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairments remain underdiagnosed due to workforce shortages, stigma, and infrastructural constraints. Telehealth technologies offer a potential mechanism to expand access to psychological care, yet adoption across SSA remains uneven. This paper provides a conceptual, theory-driven synthesis exploring telehealth adoption for mental health support in stroke rehabilitation across SSA, guided by Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovation Theory. A structured conceptual review was conducted using literature from PubMed, Scopus, AJOL, and Google Scholar (2005–2024). Inclusion criteria focused on SSA studies addressing telehealth or mHealth in mental health or rehabilitation contexts. Thematic synthesis was guided by Rogers’ five innovation attributes, relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability, to assess adoption facilitators and barriers. Telehealth adoption is influenced by cultural compatibility, simplicity of design, perceived relative advantage, observable benefits through pilot projects, and supportive policy environments. Successful initiatives in Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda demonstrate the importance of localized adaptation and user engagement. Telehealth provides a scalable pathway to address post-stroke mental health needs in SSA. Effective adoption requires culturally responsive design, targeted capacity-building, and policy alignment with national and regional digital health strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and HIV continue to be significant contributors to morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa, including South Africa. This study aims to quantify the proportion of patients diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, and/or HIV who are successfully linked to and enrolled in chronic care services at DIMAMO PHRC clinics. The study employed a quantitative, cross-sectional analytical design using routinely collected clinic data covering a six-month period. The research was conducted at the DIMAMO PHRC, which serves as a Health and Demographic Surveillance System. The study population was composed of patients diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, and HIV who were aged 18 years and above. Simple random sampling was used to select the study participants. Data was analyzed using SPSS. Chi-square tests were used to compare proportions among groups. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with retention to care. The proportion of individuals diagnosed with hypertension was 28.9% in both sexes, with significantly more females being hypertensive compared to males (30.9% vs 22.8%, p = 0.001). The proportion of patients retained in the linkage-to-care intervention without interruptions for six months was highest among those diagnosed with diabetes at 34.8%, followed by those diagnosed with hypertension, HIV, and both hypertension and diabetes at 29.5%, 24.8%, and 10.9%, respectively. Regression analysis showed that retention in care without gaps longer than six months was significantly associated with age, gender, and diagnosis (single chronic conditions or combined). This study identified patterns of enrolment and retention in care among patients diagnosed with chronic conditions at DIMAMO PHRC. Findings reveal that retention was highest among patients with single conditions and lowest in those with comorbid hypertension and diabetes. These trends suggest potential areas for targeted interventions to improve linkage and continuity of care, particularly among older adults and those with multiple conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Rainfall and temperature are key climate determinants of malaria incidence; yet their causal exposure-response curves on malaria incidence across the entire Colombian territory remain unquantified. We estimated the effects of rainfall and temperature on malaria incidence at the municipal scale from 2007 to 2023. We conducted an ecological observational study in 969 Colombian municipalities located below 1,600 meters. The monthly Standardized Incidence Ratio (SIR) of malaria was calculated for each municipality. Directed acyclic graphs guided the identification of the appropriate adjustments needed to emulate the corresponding experimental design and avoid inducing bias, and the effect was estimated using a modified approach of the Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE). Exposure-response curves were estimated for two outcomes: the current month and the moving average for the current and previous month. A total of 1,075,112 cases of malaria were reported. The results suggest a non-linear relationship between rainfall and temperature concerning the SIR of malaria, indicating an optimal temperature of 25 °C and approximately 37 mm of rainfall for the highest incidence. The negative control test revealed the presence of residual confounding bias (p &lt; 0.05) in all estimates. Meanwhile, the estimations of the E-value indicated low to moderate tolerance (E-value = 1.14 – 1.48) to an unmeasured confounder. These findings support the integration of rainfall and temperature thresholds into early-warning systems for targeted malaria control.",

    "Abstract": "Background The hemodynamic management of acute spinal cord injury (SCI) aims to improve perfusion and mitigate ischemic secondary injury to the injured spinal cord, traditionally through the augmentation of mean arterial pressure (MAP). Recently, there has been interest in managing spinal cord perfusion pressure (SCPP)—the difference between MAP and intrathecal pressure (ITP) —after acute SCI. SCPP may be more physiologically relevant than MAP for neurologic recovery after traumatic SCI. Drainage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through a lumbar intrathecal catheter to reduce ITP and increase SCPP is commonly performed to reduce the risk of ischemic paralysis in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA) surgery. We investigated a protocol for CSF drainage through intrathecal catheters to maintain SCPP ≥65 mmHg in participants with acute traumatic SCI. We sought to determine if managing SCPP was associated with better neurologic recovery compared to traditional MAP targets. Methods and findings Fifty-eight participants with acute SCI (51 ± 19 years, 46M/12F) were enrolled across eight North American sites between August 2019 and May 2024 into this prospective single-arm multi-center clinical trial of CSF drainage for SCPP management ( NCT03911492 ). Data were compared to data from a historical cohort of 86 participants (44 ± 19 years, 72M/14F) who had intrathecal catheters inserted for SCPP measurement only; these participants were managed according to conventional MAP guidelines with a target MAP of 85–90 mmHg (NCT01279811). MAP, ITP, SCPP, intrathecal waveform morphology, vasopressor use, and CSF drainage volume were reported for up to 7 days following SCI. Fifteen participants in the intervention group were lost to follow-up. Neurological assessments at enrollment and 6-months post-SCI were compared. The investigator team ended the trial when it was clear that adherence to the protocol was inconsistent across study sites. Participants managed according to the SCPP management protocol had an intrathecal catheter in place 138 hours (95% CI [129,147]) and 495cc (95% CI [350,641]) of CSF drained. No CSF was drained from seven participants. There were no significant differences in hemodynamic measures such as ITP and SCPP between groups, indicating that the SCPP management protocol did not alter the hemodynamic management. Subsequently, there were no differences in measures of neurological recovery between participants managed according to SCPP management protocol and conventional MAP guidelines ( p = 0.897). Participants managed according to an SCPP target had more ITP waveform recordings noted as dampened or fully pulsatile suggesting a patent subarachnoid space (p = 0.006) and were administered vasopressors on fewer hourly observations (p = 0.004). Six reported adverse events were probably related to the intervention. Adherence to a protocol for managing SCPP through CSF drainage across multiple sites was challenging. Conclusions Ultimately, our protocol resulted in little CSF being drained, limited modification of ITP and SCPP, and no effect on neurological recovery. The relationship between CSF drainage volume and change in ITP was surprisingly unclear. This study revealed that draining CSF is more complex in traumatic SCI than in TAAA surgery patients. Future efforts to reduce ITP through CSF drainage likely need to address the occlusion of the subarachnoid space at the injury site through aggressive surgical decompression techniques.",

    "Abstract": "Background Tobacco use remains a significant public health concern worldwide. In Uganda, the youth use tobacco at almost three times the rate of adults, with those residing in slum areas exhibiting even higher prevalence levels. Since 2015, strict laws regulating public tobacco use have been implemented in Uganda, however, these measures have not led to a significant decline in tobacco consumption among the youths in slums. Objective To assess the predictors of tobacco smoking among youth living in the slum areas of Kampala, Uganda. Methods This was a cross-sectional study. It was conducted in Bwaise slum in Kampala, we recruited 422 youths aged 18–30 years. Households were sampled systematically, and quantitative data were analyzed using STATA version 14. Modified Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used, prevalence ratios (PR) were used to measure the associations. Factors were considered significant if p-values were less than 0.05. Results The prevalence of current tobacco smoking was 52.6% while the prevalence of ever tobacco smoking was 71.6%. Most of the participants (87.4%) knew the health effects of tobacco use. Gender (adj.PR = 1.74[95% CI = 1.41–2.14]) and age (adj.PR = 1.38[95%CI = 1.10–1.74]) were the strongest predictors of tobacco smoking: the prevalence of tobacco smoking was 74% higher among males compared to females and 38% higher among those aged 21−30 years compared to their younger counterparts. Education level (adj.PR = 0.84[95%CI = 0.70–0.9]), and income/= (adj.PR = 0.79[05%CI = 0.64–0.97) were also predictive of tobacco smoking. Knowledge was also a predictor with prevalence being 34%, 29%, 42% higher among those who didn’t know that smoking causes serious illness (adj.PR = 1.34[95%CI = 1.09–1.64]), stroke (adj.PR = 1.29[95%CI = 1.06–1.59]) and lung cancer (adj.PR = 1.42[95%CI = 1.11–1.83]) respectively. Conclusion More than half of the youth smoke tobacco despite awareness of its health effects. These findings call for development and implementation of targeted initiatives that address the unique needs and behaviors of males, aged 21–30 years, individuals of education below secondary level while addressing the knowledge gaps about effects of tobacco smoking on human health.",

    "Abstract": "Background In Eswatini, adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) face disproportionate challenges in achieving optimal anti-retroviral therapy (ART) adherence, as evidenced by a viral load suppression (VLS) of 77.8% among those aged 15–19 years, compared to the 96.2% VLS observed among adults on ART. While mobile phone ownership has surged globally, facilitating the use of mobile phone-based interventions in healthcare, there remains limited evidence on the development and testing of such interventions for improving ART adherence among ALHIV. This study aimed to design a mobile gaming application (app) to promote ART adherence among ALHIV in Eswatini. Methods A systematic, iterative approach involving a multidisciplinary team of researchers, ALHIV, and app developers was adopted in designing, developing, and testing the prototype of “ The Conqueror” game . A total of seven focus group discussion sessions, each comprising 12 participants conveniently sampled from five Teen Clubs in the Hhohho region of Eswatini, were conducted between 27 April and 20 July 2024 to inform the design and development of the mobile game. The usability and acceptability of the game were assessed using self-administered questionnaires among 35 ALHIV, who were not involved in the game development process and were conveniently selected from the Teen Clubs. The qualitative data were analysed thematically, while the quantitative data were analysed descriptively. Results Participants desired mobile games aimed at enhancing social support through reminders, acceptance, encouragement, and knowledge. Social support was integrated into a storyline that informed the development of The Conqueror , which centres on a hero who conquers opposition and collects an artefact daily to maintain viral suppression. The game features gamification elements such as a life bar, progressive difficulty, daily cycles, three stages with five-day challenges, and power-ups for health boosts and speed increases. The feasibility of The Conqueror were rated relatively high, at 86.2% and 82.8%, for usability and acceptability respectively. Conclusion Gamified mHealth interventions co-developed with potential end-users demonstrate high usability and acceptability. However, further piloting of The Conqueror game through randomized trials is essential to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach in improving ART adherence among adolescents before broader implementation and scaling to a wider adolescent population.",

    "Abstract": "Leaf growth is a dynamic process that critically determines canopy architecture and assimilate allocation in rapeseed. Quantifying the distribution of leaf biomass along the main stem across developmental stages is essential for advancing functional-structural plant models of rapeseed. To address the lack of a leaf biomass partitioning model in existing rapeseed growth models, this study developed a rank-specific leaf biomass partitioning coefficient model for the main stem in rapeseed. Field experiments were conducted over three growing seasons (2012–2015) using three cultivars: Ningyou 18 (V1, conventional), Ningyou 16 (V2, conventional), and Ningza 19 (V3, hybrid). The experiments were conducted under factorial combinations of cultivar, nitrogen fertilizer, and transplanting density. The leaf biomass partitioning coefficient was calculated as the ratio of leaf biomass at a given leaf rank to the total main-stem leaf biomass, with leaf ranks normalized to the (0–1] interval. Model parameters were estimated to elucidate how cultivar and environmental factors influence partitioning patterns across leaf positions. Validation using independent experimental data showed strong agreement between the simulated and observed values, with a correlation coefficient ( r ) more than 0.9 ( p &lt; 0.001). The mean absolute difference ( d a ) ranged from −0.080 to 0.011 g g -1 , and the ratio of d a to the average observation ( d ap ) varied between 3.077% (anthesis stage) and 13.083% (normalized leaf rank). The root mean square error ( RMSE ) values were all below 0.193 g g -1 across all stages, with the most stage-specific RMSE values under 0.032 g g -1 . The results demonstrate that the model performs reliably in simulating the main-stem leaf biomass partitioning coefficient across hierarchical leaf ranks in rapeseed. By integrating leaf-level biomass allocation with whole-plant growth processes, this work provides a key component for developing a functional-structural rapeseed model and supports further research on source-sink regulation and canopy optimization.",

    "Abstract": "Objective Arthroplasty in the cervical spine is performed using Total Disc Replacement (TDR) implants. This study investigates the safety and tribology of a design-optimized ceramic TDR bearing. Methods Samples of an optimized bearing geometry were manufactured from the bioceramic BIOLOX ® delta (CeramTec GmbH, Germany) and tested in a six degree of freedom universal joint simulator in diluted calf serum at body temperature. The investigated load and motion profiles simulated movements of daily living; three pure rotations under static load and three rotations coupled under sinusoidal load as well as adverse events (three subluxation test conditions). Results Dynamic coefficients of friction during flexion/extension and lateral bending were µ = 0.16 ± 0.011 and µ = 0.16 ± 0.070, respectively. Friction factors during flexion/extension and lateral bending were f = 0.14 ± 0.0092 and f = 0.13 ± 0.063, whereas the friction factor in axial rotation was f = 0.033 ± 0.0028 and for three coupled rotations under sinusoidal load, it was f = 0.13 ± 0.028. The design demonstrated a sufficient resistance against subluxation, with subluxation forces more than 3.5-fold the 20N that are typically required as acceptance criteria in FDA safety and effectiveness data. Conclusion Friction values were found to be comparable to or higher than those typically reported for ceramic-on-ceramic hip replacements. Furthermore, the results indicated that the optimized bearing design is sufficiently resistant to subluxation. Significance: Test protocols to investigate safety and tribology of cervical TDRs are proposed and their results are reported for a design-optimized ceramic TDR bearing.",

    "Abstract": "Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium (CRP), the dried peel of citrus fruits, holds notable dietary and medicinal value. Its quality and price largely depend on origin and aging. Lower-grade CRP is often adulterated to imitate premium products, making accurate authentication of region and vintage essential for quality assurance and fair market valuation. Existing methods for vintage classification are limited due to complex equipment and high operational costs, restricting their scalability in practical applications. To address these issues, a convenient method for the accurate identification of Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium using image and multi-stream is proposed. The method comprises three main stages. Firstly, an object detection network with bounding box refinement localizes exocarp and albedo regions from whole CRP images. Secondly, a three-stream feature extractor processes the whole images along with exocarp and albedo patches to capture complementary visual details. A channel-level feature interaction module further enhances robustness through cross-region feature integration. Thirdly, a meta-learning module enables rapid adaptation to images captured under varying conditions by different consumer-grade devices. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 95.5% on iPhone-captured images. In addition, for images captured by different devices, the proposed method achieves a relative accuracy improvement of more than 34% over the direct transfer method, mainly owing to the meta-learning adaptation to different devices.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Worldwide, cryptococcosis has increased due to HIV/AIDS, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where the mortality is high. Laboratory diagnosis for cryptococcosis among HIV-infected patients remains a challenge in most SSA countries. This study aimed to explore facilitators, barriers to re-implementing the India ink test, and logistical factors that could support the successful rollout of this alternative diagnostic method in southern Mozambique. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study using mixed methods approaches in six hospitals across southern Mozambique over three months. Clinicians and laboratory technicians were asked to complete a questionnaire aimed to capture sociodemographic data, as well as current practices and clinical approaches with respect to cryptococcal diagnosis and clinical management. Subsequently, individual in-depth interviews were conducted to understand current challenges in the diagnosis of cryptococcosis and to assess facilitators, barriers, and potential opportunities for interventions. Quantitative data were captured through REDCap and subsequently analyzed using SPSS statistical program, while qualitative data were analyzed manually using a combination of content and thematic analysis approaches. Results A total of 98 healthcare providers (67 clinicians and 31 laboratory technicians) participated in the study. The mean age of the participants was 35 years. More than half were female (58.2%) and had at least five years of relevant work experience (53.1%). Challenges in diagnosing and managing cryptococcal disease were mainly related to 1) frequent shortages in the stocks of cryptococcal rapid antigen test, 2) contextual challenges in collecting cerebrospinal fluid samples, and 3) frequent shortages in the stocks of antifungal medications. In contrast, all study facilities had availability of microscopes, recognized the need for cryptococcal screening services, and had clinicians and laboratory technicians willing to collaborate for eventual roll-out of the test as routine practice. Conclusion Frequent stock-outs of rapid diagnostic tests and challenges associated with performing lumbar punctures are barriers to routine screening for cryptococcosis. In contrast, we have identified the universal availability of microscopes and health workers’ recognition of the problem, as well as their willingness to collaborate, as potential facilitators to leverage for the successful reintroduction of India ink microscopy of urine samples as a low-cost laboratory test alternative.",

    "Abstract": "Due to carrying the orbital angular momentum, Optical vortices generated by spiral zone plates, have become an important tool for studying physics and detecting matter. However, spiral zone plates, limited by its inherent structure, struggle to integrate multiple functionalities including efficient high-order diffraction suppression, flexible generation of complex vortices, and compatibility with standard planar fabrication processes into a single element to meet current composite demands. By converting the three-dimensional structure of a Gabor spiral zone plates into a two-dimensional structure, we propose a single-focus spiral zone plates with an approximately sinusoidal transmittance, termed the quasi-random square Gabor spiral zone plates (QSGSZPs). Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the QSGSZPs not only effectively achieve single-order diffraction but also enable the generation of complex vortex structures, including flower-shaped optical vortex lattices and vortex twins, through topological charge modulation. The focusing properties of the QSGSZPs with different parameters were also investigated, and its potential applications in edge-enhanced imaging and optical communications were demonstrated. This element with its unique properties is expected to find widespread applications in a variety of fields.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Considering the high incidence, mortality, and long-term effects of sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE), along with the availability of sedation therapy data and the significance of distress management, this study investigated the relationship between sedation therapy and one-year all-cause mortality in patients with SAE. Methods This retrospective cohort study utilized the Medical Information Market for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV) database. We gathered demographic data, vital signs, laboratory test results, microbial findings, comorbidities, scoring systems, treatments administered within the first 24 hours of patient admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), and follow-up data from 24 hours after ICU admission to one year. Cox regression models were employed to evaluate the relationship between sedation therapy and one-year all-cause mortality among patients with SAE. Propensity score matching (PSM) and subgroup analyses were used to assess the robustness of the findings. Results Four thousand six hundred eighteen patients with SAE were enrolled, including 3,343 in the sedative group and 1,275 in the non-sedative group; additionally, 511 pairs were matched. A protective correlation was observed between propofol monotherapy and one-year all-cause mortality in patients with SAE, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.51 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.40–0.65), P &lt; 0.001. Furthermore, the interaction between propofol monotherapy and ventilation support significantly increased one-year all-cause mortality, yielding an HR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.49–1.00) with P for interaction = 0.041. The results of PSM remained robust. Conclusion Our study indicated that compared to patients with SAE who did not receive sedation, administering propofol alone significantly reduced one-year all-cause mortality among patients with SAE. For patients undergoing ventilation support on the first day of ICU admission, the interaction between sedation therapy and ventilation support significantly influenced the one-year all-cause mortality of patients with SAE.",

    "Abstract": "Although leptospirosis is one of the most common zoonotic diseases worldwide, limited surveillance and poor coordination between human and animal health sectors have resulted in scarce and disparate data on its occurrence. Strengthening integrated surveillance requires cross-sector collaboration, beginning with the engagement of key organizations. The aims of this study were to 1) determine key health experts’ awareness and risk perceptions of leptospirosis and of zoonotic disease surveillance in Ontario, Canada, and 2) examine key components of engagement, such as perceived value and interest, during the initial stages of developing an integrated leptospirosis surveillance framework. A web-based survey was sent to 543 experts in human, animal, and environmental health in Ontario, and analyzed using a mixed-methods approach to identify key factors influencing perceptions of leptospirosis, including views on Leptospira distribution, the impact of human behavior, and the influence of environmental conditions. Leptospirosis was recognized as a health threat in Ontario by 90% (74/82) of respondents, and 91% (70/77) indicated that current surveillance efforts are inadequate. A higher proportion of animal health sector respondents identified leptospirosis as a threat to human (93%, 37/40) and animal health (90%, 44/49) compared to public health sector respondents (76%, 25/33 and 83%, 25/30, respectively). All participants (81/81) acknowledged the benefits of integrated surveillance over the current siloed approach. Our findings highlight that key public and animal health experts perceive leptospirosis as a health threat in Ontario and support more integrated disease surveillance to better respond to this emerging zoonotic pathogen.",

    "Abstract": "There is controversy regarding whether dance training improves balance performance. This study aims to compare the dynamic balance performance of non-dancers and amateur dancers, as well as to examine whether differences in dynamic balance exist across various dance genres. Eighty-one participants, including 24 Flamenco dancers (FLA), 15 Latin dancers (LAT), 20 Chinese folk dancers (CHF), and 22 non-dancers as the control group (CG), completed the Y-Balance test. Anterior (YBant), posteromedial (YBpm), posterolateral (YBpl), and composite (YBcom) scores were calculated. All significant differences between groups were observed in YBcom, YBpl, and YBpm (p &lt; 0.05), with no differences in YBant (p &gt; 0.05). The CHF and FLA achieved higher scores compared to CG in both dominant leg (DL) and non-dominant leg (NDL), and to those of LAT in NDL for YBpm. The LAT scored slightly higher than CG (p &lt; 0.05, d &lt; 0.2), but it was not statistically significant. Dancers have better dynamic balance except for the YBant direction. FLA and CHF may be more effective in improving dynamic balance compared to LAT. This study was designed by considering previously contentious research findings that may be due to the distinct movement patterns and training methods of professional dancers, as well as the variations across different dance styles. The comparison of balance performance between amateur dancers, rather than professional dancers, and non-participants has significant practical implications for determining whether dance can improve an individual’s balance.",

    "Abstract": "Drug hypersensitivity reactions (DHR) are commonly observed with various medications. However, some drugs, like Qingkailing (QKL), iodixanol, and vancomycin, previously classified as pseudoallergic, do not align with clinical observations, creating uncertainty in understanding DHR mechanisms and implementing prevention. In response, our research team hypothesized that IgE-mediated allergy and pseudoallergic hypersensitivity may synergistically lead to more severe reactions. We established an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity model using an anti-dinitrophenyl IgE monoclonal antibody in RBL-2H3 cells and employed ovalbumin (OVA) for guinea pigs. Compound 48/80 served as a positive control for non-immunologic hypersensitivity. We measured β-hexosaminidase and histamine released in cells and guinea pigs to focus on hypersensitivity responses from both IgE-mediated and pseudoallergic pathways. Results indicated that combining pseudoallergic drugs and IgE significantly increased the hypersensitivity response compared to IgE or separate compound 48/80 groups. This effect was mirrored in the OVA-induced model. Notably, the three pseudoallergic drugs exhibited a similar increase in IgE-mediated hypersensitivity. These findings highlight the additive effects of IgE-mediated and pseudoallergic hypersensitivity, suggesting a more potent DHR response. The study also measured several cytokines and developed a method to differentiate between allergic, pseudoallergic DHRs, and additive reactions, aiding in understanding and controlling serious DHR risks in clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a vector-borne, transmissible zoonotic disease in animals and humans caused by RVF virus and transmitted primarily by mosquitoes and biting flies. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), RVF outbreaks have great public health and economic impact, with up to 90% mortality in lambs and approximately 10% in adult sheep. Besides small ruminants, RVF affects cattle, camels, and goats and induces abortion storms and neonatal mortality at high rates, whereas humans develop severe febrile illness, hemorrhagic fever, or encephalitis in extreme cases. In this study, a deterministic epidemic model is developed and studied to investigate the RVF transmission dynamics under inclusion of delay differential equations and an entropy-based global stability approach to capture the time-dependent effect of disease progression. The model separates the ruminant population into susceptible, vaccinated, infected, and recovered, and the mosquito population into susceptible and infected. Positivity, and boundedness are demonstrated as basic dynamical properties. Two equilibria are found and compared: Rift Valley Fever–Free Equilibrium (RVFFE) and Rift Valley Fever Endemic Equilibrium (RVFEE). The basic reproduction number ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\" id=\"M1\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msub> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi mathvariant=\"bold-italic\">R</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mn mathvariant=\"bold\">0</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:msub> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) is derived and local and entropy-based global stability are examined by the Routh–Hurwitz criteria and LaSalle’s invariance principle. Sensitivity analysis reveals the contribution of critical parameters on disease transmission and persistence. Numerical simulations performed using MATLAB’s built-in DDE23 solver assist in revealing the effect of delay on infection dynamics and susceptibility with time. The implications provide tremendous insight into the role of temporal considerations and parameter uncertainty in the transmission dynamics of RVF and enable better understanding as well as potential control strategies for this emerging zoonotic disease.",

    "Abstract": "Consumer behavior during crisis has grown into an increasingly significant subject of study, as financial and social disturbances affect purchase choices and market dynamics. In Lebanon, a country experiencing a prolonged economic crisis and societal instability, businesses and policymakers face urgent challenges in maintaining consumer demand for domestic products. Drawing on the Theory of Reasoned Action and the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, this study aims to investigate the demographic, psychological, and socioeconomic predictors of ethnocentrism and purchasing intentions for Lebanese products in this environment. A quantitative approach was adopted. Data were collected from 606 Lebanese consumers through a structured survey between March and May 2021 during the country’s financial collapse, COVID-19 pandemic, and Beirut port explosion. The findings show that ethnocentrism (β = 0.253, p &lt; 0.001) and SES (β = 1.479, p = 0.003) directly predict purchase intentions for Lebanese products. Demographic factors influence ethnocentric tendencies, and coping ability operates more strongly among older consumers (β = −0.023, p = 0.047). Ethnocentrism partially mediates the age effect, while SES shows inconsistent mediation patterns. These insights extend psychological models of behavior by demonstrating how coping mechanisms and socioeconomic standing interact with identity-based attitudes to influence consumption during national crises. The study offers theoretical contributions relevant to crisis contexts and provides practical insights for marketers and policymakers aiming to strengthen domestic markets through targeted segmentation and culturally aligned messaging.",

    "Abstract": "China’s cultural creative products are highly homogenized and can no longer meet the growing aesthetic needs of Chinese consumers. In the museum sector, the sluggish sales of cultural and creative products have become a pain point in its development. Research on consumers’ perceptions and purchase intentions regarding museum cultural creative products has grown significantly in recent years, emerging as a key trend in museum sustainability and communication effectiveness studies. Existing research predominantly adopts a design perspective, evaluating designs based on aesthetic and functional needs, while neglecting the influence of consumers’ cultural identity. This study investigates the influence of cultural identity on Chinese consumers’ willingness to purchase museum cultural products. To achieve this, we developed a Cultural Identity Model (CIM) based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Based on the analysis of data from 404 respondents, Chinese consumers do not perceive cultural identity (P = 0.476), ethnic identity (P = 0.482), or religious identity (P = 0.242) associated with museum cultural creative products as influential factors in their purchase decisions. However, they focus on the product attributes of cultural and creative designs (materials, colors, P = 0.042) as well as functional attributes (practicality, usability and durability, P &lt; 0.01), all of which effectively enhance consumers’ purchase intention. Grounded in the cultural identity perspective, this study investigates determinants that actively catalyze purchase behavior toward museum-based cultural and creative products. The findings deliver novel design frameworks and theoretical foundations for the cultural and creative products development. This study provides empirical support for optimizing the design of museum cultural and creative products, and suggests focusing on the integration of functional attributes (such as practicality) and carriers of perceived cultural symbols (such as materials and colors).",

    "Abstract": "Background Microcirculatory dysfunction is a pivotal factor in the pathophysiology and prognosis of critically ill patients. While traditional resuscitation primarily emphasizes macrocirculatory parameters such as mean arterial pressure (MAP), emerging evidence indicates that maintaining a normal MAP alone does not guarantee adequate microvascular perfusion. As a result, bedside evaluation of microcirculation has garnered increased interest as a supplementary method to hemodynamic monitoring. Objective This scoping review aims to systematically map and categorize existing bedside tools and technologies used to assess microcirculation in critically ill patients. The review will summarize their clinical applications, advantages, limitations, and integration into intensive care practice, and identify key evidence gaps to guide future research. Methods In accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) framework and the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a comprehensive literature search will be conducted across MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, and ProQuest. Additionally, the grey literature search will be complemented by searches of trial registries such as ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO ICTRP. Eligible studies will encompass all primary research involving critically ill patients evaluated for microcirculatory function at the bedside within intensive care units (ICUs). Data extraction and synthesis will adhere to an inductive–deductive thematic approach based on Braun and Clarke’s methodology, complemented by the PAGER framework to identify patterns, advances, gaps, and evidence pertinent to clinical practice. Conclusion By mapping the landscape of bedside microcirculatory assessment tools, this review will support the translation of microcirculatory monitoring from research to clinical practice, thereby promoting physiologically guided, individualized management in critically ill patients.

    "Abstract": "Introduction This study was conducted to determine the relationship between negative childhood experiences of pregnant women and health-promoting lifestyle behaviours and childbirth attitudes. Methods The cross-sectional study was conducted with 468 pregnant women between March 2023 and January 2024. Data were collected using a descriptive characteristics form, an adverse childhood experiences questionnaire (ACEQ), a health-promoting lifestyle profile (HPLP-II), and a childbirth attitude questionnaire (CAQ). The study reporting followed the STROBE checklist. Results Participants’ mean scores were as follows: ACEQ 1.10 ± 1.84, CAQ 39.91 ± 12.18, and HPLP-II 138.64 ± 23.71. Linear regression analysis showed that HPLP-II scores were significantly lower in non-employed women ( β = −0.194; 95% CI: −14.06, −5.44; p = 0.000) and smokers ( β = −0.104; 95% CI: −12.05, −1.05; p = 0.020). Lower income perception was significantly associated with decreased HPLP-II scores ( β = −0.170; 95% CI: −11.34 to −3.48; p = 0.000). Additionally, higher ACEQ scores were also significantly related to lower HPLP-II scores (β = −0.092; 95% CI: −2.29 to −0.06; p = 0.037). Regarding CAQ, scores were significantly higher among participants with lower income perception ( β = −0.200; 95% CI: −6.35, −2.59; p = 0.000), those who consumed alcohol during pregnancy ( β = −0.322; 95% CI: −16.36, −9.70; p = 0.000), and those with higher ACEQ scores ( β = 0.158; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.58; p = 0.000).

    "Abstract": "Network centralization, driven by hub nodes, impacts communication efficiency, structural integration, and dynamic processes such as diffusion and synchronization. Although numerous centralization measures exist, a major challenge lies in determining measures that are both theoretically sound and empirically reliable across different network contexts. To resolve this challenge, we normalize 11 measures of network centralization and assess them systematically using an axiomatic framework and numerical simulations. Our axiomatic assessment tests each measure against the six postulates of centralization, ensuring consistency with minimal theoretical requirements. In addition, our numerical assessment examines the behavior of normalized centralization measures over different random graphs. Our results indicate major differences among the measures, despite their common aim of quantifying centralization. Together, our assessments point to the relative suitability of three measures: normalized betweenness centralization, normalized closeness centralization, and normalized degree centralization. Applying these three measures to real-world networks from diverse domains reveals meaningful variation in the organization of the networks with respect to hubs. Normalized betweenness centralization highlights path-based dominance; normalized closeness centralization reflects accessibility and efficiency of reach; and normalized degree centralization captures degree-based hub concentration. When used jointly, the three measures demonstrate the required sensitivity to varying levels of centralization and provide complementary aspects of network centralization that no single measure can offer alone. Our dual evaluation framework clarifies conceptual differences among existing measures and offers practical guidance for selecting reliable centralization metrics.",

    "Abstract": "Technological advances in recent decades have intensified the need for strong language and literacy skills, such that deficits in these skills can significantly reduce occupational opportunities and social richness. Nonetheless, the causes of language and literacy deficits remain scarcely understood, so treatment consists mostly of drill on the very skills affected individuals struggle to perform. The purpose of this study was to test two related hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 was that delays in the development of the central auditory pathways greatly constrain acquisition of language skills dependent upon auditory development; these skills primarily involve those that are late emerging, namely phonological sensitivity. A corollary is that language skills that begin emergence early in life are less affected by delays in auditory development; this largely encompasses lexicosyntactic knowledge. Hypothesis 2 was that some conditions heretofore recognized as impacting language acquisition (poverty and premature birth, for the purpose of this study) take their toll at least in part by constraining the timely development of the central auditory pathways. To test these hypotheses, 104 children (5–6 years old) spanning continua of socioeconomic status and gestational age at birth were tested on (1) three measures of suprathreshold auditory functions associated with development of the central auditory pathways, (2) two measures of lexicosyntactic knowledge, and (3) two measures of phonological sensitivity. Results largely supported both hypotheses: Strong relationships were found between suprathreshold auditory functions and language measures, especially phonological sensitivity, and both socioeconomic status and gestational age appeared to exert their influence on language acquisition completely or partly through an effect on auditory function. These results should serve to refocus the search for causes of language and literacy deficits from purely environmental shortcomings to biological determinants, with newly inspired directions for interventional approaches.",

    "Abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is the leading cause of hospital-associated diarrhea and has remained a consistent threat for older patients and those with comorbidities or vulnerabilities. The high rates of treatment failure and recurrence, along with the decreased effectiveness of first-line treatments highlight the urgent need for the development of new anti- C. difficile agents. α-mangostin is a natural compound isolated from the edible mangosteen fruit pericarps that has known antimicrobial activity. α-mangostin is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), which is ideal for treatment of CDI to accumulate at the site of infection at concentrations capable of clearing C. difficile . We found that α-mangostin was as potent as the standard-of-care vancomycin, inhibiting a diverse panel of C. difficile strains at a concentration range of 0.5–2 µg/mL. It exhibited rapid bactericidal activity, completely clearing C. difficile in vitro within 2 hours, surpassing vancomycin and fidaxomicin. Additionally, α-mangostin’s anti- C. difficile activity was not affected by the high C. difficile inoculum. To further understand its mechanism, we investigated α-mangostin’s membrane disruption activity by assessing the leakage of DNA and ATP post-exposure. α-mangostin resulted in a significant leakage of DNA and ATP indicating that its anti- C. difficile activity is mediated by the bacterial cell membrane disruption. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that α-mangostin possesses desirable characteristics for a promising anti- C. difficile which merits further investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Background Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) are a major public health concern. Primary care (PC) is the ideal setting for their diagnosis. Designing effective strategies requires a thorough understanding of the problems these patients face when seeking care. Objectives To identify barriers and facilitators to the diagnosis of HIV and STIs in PC and classify them according to the theoretical Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation model of Behaviour (COM-B model). The review’s findings will inform the development of specific intervention strategies. Methods We conducted a systematic review (SR) of qualitative studies of barriers and facilitators to the diagnosis of HIV/STI. A systematic literature search, without publication date limitation, was performed in Embase, Cochrane Library, and Medline via PubMed. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scale was used to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. The results were synthesised and presented according to the dimensions of the COM-B model. Results Of the 1,366 records from the initial search strategy, 70 articles met all inclusion criteria, covering all HIV/STIs and different risk groups. Barriers and facilitators to diagnosis were identified at three levels: patients, professionals, and health system. Patient barriers included confidentiality issues, lack of risk perception, shame and stigma, and access. The barriers at the level of professionals were lack of training, time constraints, and scarcity of resources. Among the facilitators, the most notable were minimally invasive sampling methods, ensuring confidentiality, standardisation of tests, fast and efficient entry points, and professional training. Discussion This SR provides information on barriers and facilitators to HIV/STI diagnosis in PC and across the different stakeholders involved (patients, providers, system). The results are grouped into the different dimensions of a behavioural model (capability, opportunity, and motivation). A thorough understanding of the complexity of the behaviour of people diagnosed with HIV/STIs and all those involved in their management will enable the development of effective intervention strategies to diagnose and prevent these processes, thereby reducing the associated disease burden.

    "Abstract": "In vitro spermatogenesis (IVS) remains a major challenge due to its complexity and extended duration. Although organ culture of neonatal mouse testes can support complete spermatogenesis, its three-dimensional structure limits precise observation and control of culture conditions, resulting in heterogeneous oxygen and nutrient gradients. Two-dimensional (2-D) systems provide greater accessibility but often induce accelerated or abnormal meiosis. In this study, we present a simplified, serum free 2-D culture system that enables meiotic progression of mouse germ cells to the mid pachytene stage. Testicular cells from Acrosin ( Acr )-GFP transgenic mice (2.5 to 10.5 days postpartum : dpp) were enzymatically dissociated and cultured in APEL medium, a chemically defined and serum free basal formulation. The medium was supplemented with bovine pituitary extract (BPE), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone (BFT medium). Meiotic progression was monitored in real time by GFP fluorescence and further assessed by immunocytochemistry and nuclear spread analysis. Testicular cells consistently formed Sertoli cell monolayers and supported germ cell differentiation to mid pachytene stage. GFP-positive cells appeared around days 17.5 to 21.5 of culture, reflecting a modest delay compared to organ culture. GFP-positive cells were observed not only in 7.5 to 10.5 dpp cultures, but also in 2.5 to 6.5 dpp testes lacking preexisting spermatocytes, indicating de novo induction of meiosis. BFT medium, compared to APEL medium, increased the frequency of GFP-positive wells and the per-well duration of GFP expression, reaching statistical significance in the 9.5–10.5 dpp group (p = 0.021). Nuclear spread analysis confirmed synapsis through pachytene, although cells did not progress to diplotene. This simplified culture system offers a robust and accessible platform for studying early meiotic events and optimizing IVS.",

    "Abstract": "Background The transition from dental student to practicing dentist is often accompanied by high level of stress and risk of burnout. This shift from academic to professional roles can overwhelm students and compromise their well-being. Addressing burnout early is essential to maintain academic performance, resilience, and quality patient care. Mindfulness interventions have shown increasing empirical support in reducing stress and burnout. This mixed-methods study evaluated the effectiveness of mindfulness-based life skill-building sessions in alleviating burnout among final-year dental students at Baqai Dental College, Karachi, Pakistan. Method A sequential mixed-method study was conducted at Baqai Dental College in Karachi, Pakistan, involving sixty-nine final-year dental students. The intervention comprised two mindfulness sessions. Participants completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires that included demographic information and the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory–Student Survey (CBI-SS), a validated 25-item tool assessing burnout across four domains: personal, study-related, colleague-related, and teacher-related. Post-intervention questionnaires were completed immediately after the sessions. Qualitative data were obtained through focus group discussions with stakeholders to explore perceptions of burnout and assess the relevance and feasibility of mindfulness sessions. Quantitative data were analyzed using paired t-tests, while qualitative data were examined through content analysis and triangulated with literature and documentation. Result Diverse emotions and experiences were revealed through qualitative analysis, underscoring the substantial influence of exhaustion on personal, academic, and professional domains. Furthermore, the mean exhaustion scores were significantly different between the pre- and post-intervention periods, with a p-value of 0.001. Students conveyed satisfaction and a desire for more meaningful sessions that bolster life-building skills. Conclusion The study findings demonstrate a decrease in burnout rates following the intervention, indicating the necessity for interventions to mitigate academic stress. Qualitative findings underscore the significance of a student support centre and self-care initiatives.",

    "Abstract": "Physical inactivity among children in Western countries, especially children from ethnic minority groups, is a global health concern. Schools provide an ideal setting to address children’s physical activity needs, with teachers playing a major role. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore teachers’ perspectives on barriers and motivators to physical activity participation in children from ethnic minority groups and to determine through their suggestions, how schools can be better supported to provide a physical activity-enabling environment. A purposive sample of eight primary school teachers in the Northeast of England, United Kingdom, participated in semi-structured interviews conducted through a combination of face-to-face and virtual settings. Reflexive thematic analysis identified seven barriers and nine motivators to physical activity, distributed across different levels of the socio-ecological theory. At the intrapersonal level, motivators included fun and wellbeing, whereas barriers included behavioural issues, and increased screen time. The interpersonal level encompassed influences of friends, parents, and teachers. At the institutional level, in-school activities were identified as motivators. At the community level, environmental influence and perceptions of safety were identified as barriers. At the public policy level, government/local council and resources were identified as both barriers and motivators. Notably, the teachers’ perspectives align with previous findings on barriers and motivators to physical activity among children from ethnic minority groups in the Northeast of England, while contributing to policy-level insights. These policy-level insights highlight the importance of staff training, government funding, and sports infrastructure improvements.",

    "Abstract": "SIRT7 is a member of the sirtuin family and has emerged as a crucial player in cancer biology, with a multifaceted role in both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing activities. Despite its importance in connecting NAD+ metabolism with transcriptional regulation, a systematic analysis across multiple cancer types remains underexplored, thereby limiting our understanding of its prognostic value, mutational impact, immune associations, and therapeutic potential. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the pan-cancer significance of SIRT7 through integrated computational approaches. We employed protein structure modeling, deep neural network-guided protein interaction analysis, cancer hallmark association, gene expression profiling, survival analysis, mutational landscape, immune infiltration assessment, and structure-based drug discovery, combining molecular docking and dynamics simulations. Our deep neural network analyses revealed SIRT7 as a central hub connecting NAD+ metabolism with transcriptional regulation in its sub-network (R 2 : 0.9839). SIRT7 exhibited differential expression across 17 cancer types, with high expression associated with poor survival in six cancer types; however, it surprisingly correlated with better outcomes in sarcoma. Cancer-specific mutations significantly reduced patient survival and altered the expression of network components. We identified regulatory mechanisms involving five miRNAs and three transcription factors. Therapeutic intervention identified two promising SIRT7 inhibitors (ZINC000150487575 and ZINC000150641215) with superior binding properties compared to the reference inhibitor. This comprehensive pan-cancer analysis of SIRT7 provides a framework for understanding its role in cancer biology and identifies potential therapeutic opportunities for personalized interventions. Our findings have immediate implications for clinical oncology, enabling SIRT7 as a biomarker for patient stratification and a therapeutic target for novel inhibitor development. Targeting SIRT7 may offer new therapeutic strategies for various cancers, particularly those with high SIRT7 expression, as SIRT7 functions in a context-dependent manner in cancer regulation. Further studies are necessary to validate the efficacy of SIRT7 inhibitors and explore their role in therapeutic resistance and disease recurrence.",

    "Abstract": "Like most developing countries, it is pivotal to identify factors associated with birth intervals in Bangladesh for intervening programs to reduce maternal and under-five children deaths. In this study, an attempt has been made to examine the socioeconomic and demographic factors that influence birth intervals in rural and urban Bangladesh. For this purpose, the secondary data extracted from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS), 2017−18 and 2022 have been utilized where a two-stage stratified sampling technique is used for data collection. The sample has been considered based on the information available on the birth interval for the last child of mothers. We have applied the Product-Limit approach, Log-rank test and the popular semi parametric frailty regression model that takes into account the possible correlation among observations from the same cluster. Slight disparity has been observed in the median birth intervals between urban (64 months, 2017−18; 67 months, 2022) and rural mothers (60 months, 2017−18; 63 months, 2022). In both datasets, age at marriage, women’s decision making autonomy, and division have been emerged as significant determinants of the birth intervals in rural and urban Bangladesh. In the 2017−18 data, the effect of partner’s education is limited to urban areas, while religion shows significance only in rural areas. Meanwhile, in the 2022 data, the wealth index and spousal age difference become significant only in rural areas. It is recommended that the government invest in programs to enhance women’s autonomy, since women’s greater autonomy significantly delays subsequent births in both rural and urban areas. According to the most recent 2022 data, rural women from middle class and rich families have significantly longer birth intervals compared to the poor families, hence promotion of family planning counseling should be more strongly promoted to them. In addition, analysis using 2022 data reveals that in rural areas, birth intervals initially shorten as the spousal age difference increases, then subsequently lengthen after a certain threshold; therefore, family planning initiatives in this area should incorporate guidance on selecting a proper age gap at marriage, which might contribute to longer birth intervals.",

    "Abstract": "Proliferation of misinformation poses significant challenges in contemporary society, necessitating efficient strategies for its identification and mitigation. Automated fact-checking systems might prove effective, but they face challenges, particularly in charged contexts where prior beliefs are likely to influence responses to fact-checks. Data from two studies where participants were given a piece of gun-control misinformation and an automated fact-checker correction ( N = 1,372) illustrate the nuanced interplay between prior beliefs, trust in artificial intelligence (AI), and the perceived accuracy of fact-checking systems in shaping (a) post-correction misinformation endorsement, and (b) post-correction perceptions of system quality. Study 1 examined default perceptions of system accuracy and demonstrated a high degree of variability in those perceptions; when fact-checked by such a system, people’s prior beliefs predicted continued belief after the correction and post-correction perceptions of the fact-check system. Study 2 directly manipulated the purported accuracy of the system. When automated fact-checkers were said to have an accuracy level close to current expectations of existing AI systems (67%), people continued to believe misinformation more to the extent it was consistent with prior beliefs. This pattern was attenuated when participants were told that the fact-checker was highly (97%) accurate. Similarly, prior beliefs related more strongly to post-correction perceptions of system reliability when accuracy information was provided and especially when the system was described as not highly accurate. This research demonstrates biases in reactions to automated fact-checkers and highlights the importance of accounting for individual beliefs and perceived system characteristics in designing scalable interventions.",

    "Abstract": "AIDS is a major public health issue. As a transportation and economic hub in central China, Nanchang has frequent population mobility and unbalanced regional development, making it urgent to explore the prevalence characteristics of HIV/AIDS. Based on HIV/AIDS surveillance data in Nanchang from 2012 to 2021, this study innovatively integrates the Joinpoint regression model with spatiotemporal geographic information technology to construct an epidemiological analysis framework of “time-space-population”. The results show that a total of 3,789 HIV/AIDS infection cases were reported in the decade, with the growth rate of new cases (5.4%) significantly higher than the population growth rate (2.1%). There is a negative correlation between incidence and mortality, and men and the elderly (≥65 years old) are at prominent infection risk. Spatially, cases show significant heterogeneity, with “high-high” clustering areas concentrated in the city center and gradually expanding to surrounding areas, which is related to factors such as population density. The study provides a scientific basis for targeted interventions for men and the elderly, optimization of prevention and control strategies, and regional collaboration.",

    "Abstract": "Background Healthcare workers are particularly vulnerable to psychosocial stress due to high emotional and cognitive demands, staffing shortages, and complex care responsibilities. The Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire (COPSOQ III) is a widely used tool for assessing psychosocial risks at work, but its extended Flemish version has not been systematically evaluated in healthcare settings, and evidence on its psychometric performance in this context remains limited. Objective This exploratory study aimed to examine the factor structure and internal consistency of the extended Flemish version of the COPSOQ III among healthcare workers in Flanders, Belgium, and to provide initial psychometric evidence. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 242 employees across three healthcare institutions. Construct validity was examined through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) on polychoric correlations (oblimin rotation) to derive a revised factor structure of the extended Flemish COPSOQ III. Internal consistency of the resulting dimensions was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha, ordinal alpha, and McDonald’s omega (total and hierarchical). Multiple imputation was used in sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of the factor structure and reliability estimates to missing data. A preliminary confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted as a supplementary, internal check of the proposed structure, rather than as a full confirmatory validation, given the limited sample size. Results EFAs supported retention of the original COPSOQ III domain framework while indicating meaningful within-domain refinements, including merged, split, and reallocated dimensions; the number of dimensions was reduced from 45 to 34. Most resulting dimensions showed acceptable internal consistency (ordinal α and ω_total generally ≥ 0.70), although a small number of brief scales showed lower reliability. Sensitivity analyses using multiple imputation yielded highly similar factor solutions and reliability estimates. Domain-specific CFAs provided preliminary support for the revised structures with acceptable fit on commonly used indices (e.g., CFI/TLI, RMSEA, SRMR), but these results should be interpreted cautiously as internal checks rather than definitive confirmation. Conclusion This exploratory study suggests that the extended Flemish version of COPSOQ III, with an adapted and more parsimonious structure, shows generally acceptable reliability and promising, though preliminary, evidence of construct validity for assessing psychosocial risks in healthcare settings. The adapted structure enhances its practical applicability while preserving theoretical integrity. Further research with larger and more diverse samples is recommended to confirm these findings in broader occupational contexts, test the stability of the proposed structure, and explore the utility of shorter versions in broader occupational contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Lysophagy plays a key role in maintaining autophagy homeostasis, but the induction and regulation mechanisms of lysophagy are not clear. In this study, we found that Senecavirus A (SVA) dramatically decreased lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1(LAMP1), significantly increased lysosomal permeability, and induced lysophagy. We demonstrated that the SO 2 probe (2-(4-(dimethylamino-) phenyl)1,1, 3-trimethyl-1h-benzo [e] indole-3-ium, DLC) could inhibited the degradation of LAMP1 and reduced lysophagy caused by SVA infection. DLC directly binds to LAMP1, and enhanced sulfenylation modification of LAMP1 at Cys375 to inhibit non-lysine ubiquitination. Finally, we verified the antiviral effects of DLC in cells and in BALB/c mice. Taken together, our study lays the foundation for the identification of SVA infection targets and the development of antiviral drugs in the future.",

    "Abstract": "Aldose reductase (AR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the polyol pathway, converts glucose to sorbitol using NADPH and becomes markedly overactive under hyperglycemic conditions. Its widespread expression in ocular tissues links AR to numerous eye disorders through sorbitol accumulation, microglial activation, NADPH depletion, oxidative stress, and increased formation of advanced glycation end products. These mechanisms contribute to the development of diabetic retinopathy, cataract, glaucoma, and other optic neuropathies, conditions that affect a large portion of the population and carry a substantial risk of progressing to vision loss if left untreated. The central involvement of AR in these processes has driven extensive development of aldose reductase inhibitors (ARIs), which reduce sorbitol buildup, oxidative stress, VEGF expression, and microglial activation. Thus, clarifying the functions of AR and therapeutically targeting this pathway remains essential for advancing strategies to prevent or slow the progression of ocular disease.",

Beck’s doctrine of ideas can be seen as a radicalization of some of the early phenomenological realist tendencies toward the recognition of an objective existence of ideas.

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE This qualitative study explores the experiences and perspectives of pediatric inpatient health care providers and interdisciplinary clinical staff members caring for children and families with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and other nonheterosexual and noncisgender identities (LGBTQ+), with a focus on identifying common perspectives and patterns related to inclusive practices, barriers, and opportunities for improvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS We conducted an inductive qualitative study at a 290-bed children’s hospital in the Mountain West region of the United States. Transcripts from 19 semistructured individual interviews were analyzed in 2 coding cycles. Methodological rigor was maintained via team discussions and reflexivity. RESULTS Thematic analysis revealed both challenges and opportunities in the collection and use of SOGI information in inpatient pediatric care. Three overarching themes were identified and explored: (1) confusion and discomfort in the context of anti-LGBTQ+ culture, (2) regret and variable awareness regarding harm and missed opportunities, and (3) hope for growth through education and protocol. CONCLUSIONS This study addresses a gap in the current literature on LGBTQ+ care in an inpatient setting and highlights opportunities to enhance inclusivity and patient-centered care. Addressing these areas can foster a more inclusive and equitable inpatient environment for LGBTQ+ pediatric patients and families.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends immediate referral of children screening at elevated likelihood of autism for diagnostic evaluation, early intervention, and audiology. However, most children screening at elevated autism likelihood are not referred. We aimed to synthesize decision-making processes related to generalist referrals to specialists for children with increased autism likelihood in the United States. We examined (i) rates of referral from generalist to specialist providers across medical and geographic settings, (ii) child/family factors that influence provider referrals, and (iii) facilitators and barriers to timely referral. METHODS We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Embase for studies that discussed autism likelihood in young children, discussed generalist to specialist referral, used empirical methods, and were set in the United States. We extracted the setting, study design, referral rates, child and family factors associated with referrals, and facilitators and barriers to referral. RESULTS A total of 38 articles were included. In studies with no intervention elements, providers refer children to evaluations and early intervention services at rates ranging from 20% to 58.4%. In intervention studies, referral rates ranged from 45% to 98% after intervention. Perceived symptom severity and greater caregiver concern were associated with increased referral rates. Barriers to referral included providers’ lack of confidence in screening tools and lack of local diagnostic and intervention sites. Interventions to facilitate rates of referral varied widely in their characteristics and outcomes. This review was restricted to the United States and included few high-quality experimental interventions. CONCLUSIONS Increased research efforts should focus on increasing referral rates to early intervention, which is appropriate even for children with false positive results screening at elevated autism likelihood. Rigorous studies that optimize referral processes across providers and settings are needed.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVES We assessed the prevalence of neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDDs; cognition, cerebral palsy, vision/hearing, epilepsy), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), developmental coordination disorder (DCD), behavior problems, and multimorbidity in a national cohort of children born extremely preterm (EPT, &amp;lt;27-week gestation) to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by children born EPT in early adolescence. METHODS All infants born EPT in Sweden from April 2004 through March 2007 were enrolled in the Extremely Preterm Infants in Sweden Study (EXPRESS). Of 492 survivors at age 12 years, 462 were assessed alongside 373 term-born controls. Standard instruments were used to assess cognition, motor function, and behavior. Parents completed a structured health questionnaire. Diagnoses were obtained from national health registers. RESULTS Compared with controls, children born EPT exhibited significantly higher rates of moderate/severe NDD (37.4% vs 4.6%), ASD (14.9% vs 2.41%), ADHD (21.2% vs 8.9%), DCD (29.4% vs 5.7%), and behavioral problems (35.3% vs 8.13%; all P &amp;lt; .001). Of children born EPT with no/mild NDD, 8.3% (24/289) were diagnosed with ASD and 14.5% (24/289) with ADHD, and of those with moderate/severe NDD, 26.0% (42/289) were diagnosed with ASD and 32.4% (56/173) with ADHD. Of children born EPT with moderate/severe NDD, 59% exhibited at least 2 co-occurring disabilities/disorders, and in those with no/mild disabilities, comorbidity was 24.9%. In the total EPT cohort, 57.4% were free from moderate/severe NDD and ASD, and 42.0% were free from ASD, ADHD, and DCD. CONCLUSIONS By age 12 years, a large proportion of children born EPT faced challenges because of NDD, ASD, ADHD, DCD, multimorbidity, and behavioral problems, necessitating multidisciplinary follow-up.",

    "Abstract": "The chemical weathering of ultramafic rocks by carbon dioxide–bearing fluids contributes to the geologic carbon cycle through carbonate alkalinity production. Experiments were conducted on a fresh feldspathic lherzolite from Tamarack, Minnesota, USA, and a serpentinised harzburgite from the Semail ophiolite, Oman, to investigate the dependence of chemical weathering and carbonate alkalinity on the (i) initial serpentinisation extent, (ii) rock microstructural characteristics and (iii) initial rock/water ratio. The experiments on the granulated Tamarack feldspathic lherzolite with a large rock/water ratio showed the (i) rock weathering increased pH to 9·5, which stabilised at 8·5 as fluid residence time increased, (ii) rock chemical weathering produced carbonate alkalinity by developing favourable pH conditions and (iii) dissolution rate decreased following cycles of carbon-bearing fluid injection. Analysis of feldspathic lherzolite weathering products after some 2500 h of reaction showed (i) the carbonate and hydrated carbonate minerals were not detectable for experiments with both large and small rock/water ratios and (ii) phyllosilicate minerals (talc and chrysotile) formed during the experiment with a large rock/water ratio. Comparison with experiments on serpentinised harzburgite from Oman (intact) and feldspathic lherzolite from the USA (intact and granulated), all with smaller available reactive surface areas, suggests that a decrease in the rock/water ratio and an increase in serpentinisation extent reduced reaction rates.",

    "Abstract": "The re-emerging nature of virtual reality (VR) and recurring waves of hype have made this technology a conduit for imaginations of solving complex social and ecological problems. Recent iterations of VR, such as mobile VR and VR head mounted displays (HMDs) for casual users, have made it evident that the spatial relations of VR are multiple and complex. This article utilizes the Foucauldian concept of heterotopia to explore how spatilities of VR are imagined and practiced as counter-spaces in a digital landscape of smartphones and social media. Focusing on the heterotopia’s ability to provide a space for contesting and inverting the societies within which they exist, I show how VR is constantly juxtaposed against other technologies, digital places, and techno-embodiments in user imaginaries and practices. Through ethnographic materials on domestic VR usage collected in Swedish homes, I found that notions of VR as an “other” or different medium are laden with imaginings of VR technology bringing about a better society—a virtual utopia. These positive futures are paired with and derived from dystopic imaginaries and fictions. Recognizing the necessity to take media imaginaries and their inherent spatiality seriously, through how they are expressed and acted upon in the digital geographies of everyday life, I explore how VR users’ contesting ideas are deployed to make VR a hopeful other in a technological landscape. I conclude that conceptualizations that are slippery, self-contradicting, and do works as tricksters have much to offer digital geographies.",

    "Abstract": "Misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation pose a challenge to health risk communication. These information disorders can be amplified and altered by AI. In this article, we compare governance approaches from Germany and Brazil to understand how these two democracies address the role of AI in both exacerbating and mitigating health information disorders. Drawing on document analysis of hard and soft law governance approaches, the study shows that both countries frame AI as an ambivalent tool: While AI enables large-scale production and spread of misleading content, it also provides mechanisms for detection and monitoring of this content, and allows tailored communication. In Germany, information disorders are addressed through a multi-level governance strategy that combines national regulation with international frameworks. At the same time, independent fact-checking organizations and individual actors play a complementary role by monitoring public discourse, verifying claims, and fostering media literacy. In Brazil, efforts include legislative proposals on AI, the National AI Plan, and fact-checking services, though implementation is complicated by political and economic dynamics. Across both contexts, governance measures emphasize individual and organizational responsibilities, particularly through platform regulation, transparency, and digital literacy, but often underplay broader societal and interactional factors such as political structures, trust, and post-truth dynamics.",

    "Abstract": "Prior studies have established the importance of social capital in fostering disaster resilience especially among diverse and marginalised populations. Yet, most have focused on its structural dimension, treating social capital as a pre-existing attribute. Limited attention has been given to its communicative underpinning—how shared meaning-making, particularly through storytelling networks as open and participatory spaces, actively constitutes social capital. Addressing this gap, this study draws on storytelling networks theory and the notion of narrative agency to examine how community self-organised storytelling networks, comprising agents, stories, and practices, shape collective sensemaking as the foundation of social capital. Based on 36 in-depth interviews with community members, emergency practitioners, and service providers, the study reconceptualises social capital through a participatory storytelling lens and advances a critical understanding of narrative agency amid power asymmetries. It also offers practical insights into how diverse storytelling agents co-make social capital and outlines directions for future research.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines multiple manifestations of human–technology connections (HTCs) as a phenomenon that challenges the delineation of boundaries between the biological and the technological and, in the process, calls for the reimagination of the social in the tradition of the actor–network theoretical ontology. HTCs, as a rapidly advancing sociotechnical phenomenon, are deemed by some to be liberating relative to human biological limitations and follows a long line of human–technology connections that have become integral to—and indeed been a driver of—social evolution and progress. The general historic centrality of human–technology connection, especially in high-income societies, more so than in low-income societies, is reflected by the fact that most social processes and the operations of primary social institutions have increasingly been mediated and shaped by various forms of technology. In multiple spheres of life, especially in recent decades, technical implements have substituted, supplemented, augmented, and expanded what humans must, want to, and can do. The emerging forms of HTCs significantly elevate the connection and relative “reliance” of humans on technology. The extent to which HTC transformations engender substantive erosion of boundaries between the biological (human) and technical (mostly computational), as well as the broader societal and specific intellectual implications of these transformations, is the focus of this study.",

    "Abstract": "In the last decades, digital technologies and practices have produced major changes in the way heritage is conserved and accessed, offering new methods to collect, manage, and disseminate historical artifacts and knowledge. The transformative potential of the rising digital culture refers to the enhancement of traditional processes as well as to the development of unprecedented opportunities and formats, the outcomes of which are generating a particularly significant impact on audience engagement–i.e., on the creation of cognitive, emotional, or creative experiences that enable people to have an active part in the interpretation, presentation, and use of heritage. The study aims to observe one of these new formats–namely “digital creative competitions.” Specifically, it outlines this emerging practice and reflects on its potentialities and criticalities in light of the experience carried out within Open Atelier, a project funded by the European Commission Within the Creative Europe program (CREA-CULT-2021-COOP-2). The Open Atelier Digital Competition was launched in Spring 2024 to foster young creative talents to develop innovative reinterpretations of the collections of four European house museums based on their possible connection with the achievement of one or multiple tasks blueprinted by the Sustainable Development Goals at the core of the United Nations’ 2030 Agenda. The evaluation of the outcomes of this experience provides evidence about the strategic role of digital audience engagement in generating innovation in the heritage sector by activating online co-creative forums through which young generations can become the producers and narrators of fresh and resonant perspectives.",

    "Abstract": "This project examines representations of Simeon Stylites, also known as Saint Simeon (Syméon), and Simeon the Elder, as these representations draw parallel similarities to mythologies of ancient Greece. Simeon was an ascetic saint who spent more than three decades living upon pillars in the region of Syria during the Byzantium empire. Although the saint’s ascetic discipline is fascinating in its own right, this research focuses more closely on the depictions of Simeon upon the “Serpent Pillar.” This pillar is depicted by the Plaque de Saint Syméon that is currently on display at the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. The plaque is thought to have been crafted in the late sixth century AD and shows Simeon upon a tall pillar, sitting beneath a seashell that represents the sun, and with a giant snake climbing up the column. Upon seeing this, one cannot help but be reminded of the Greek myth concerning Python of Mount Parnassus, Apollo, and his temple at Delphi. It is this connection between the Greek myth and Saint Simeon that this project intends to explore. The goal of this research is to illustrate how Greek culture influenced early figures of Christianity in a region that was predominantly ruled by Arab politics and Muslim religious influence.",

    "Abstract": "The bilateral relationship between France and Cameroon regarding migration was consolidated in 2009 with the signing of an agreement between the two parties. To support Africa in its co-development efforts, France is now contributing to the governance of African migration. This analysis—which illustrates this implication through the circular migration of Cameroonians to France, in a context of globalization and partnership—starts by analyzing the achievements of co-development in some African countries. The main objective of this study was to highlight the achievements of co-development in Cameroon by Cameroonians living in France, while examining the partnership relations between a country in the North and a country in the South, by mobilizing the theory of cooperative games. Through a thematic analysis of the documents, the study examines in depth the various achievements of the Cameroonian diaspora living in France and the role of the different actors involved in this process. We also based our argument on a questionnaire and interviews. The study highlighted the involvement of the Cameroonian diaspora in the development of Cameroon, without necessarily benefiting from the co-development projects set up by France. Finally, this analysis enabled us to establish that the concept of co-development seems to be used less and less in favor of the concept of solidarity development.",

    "Abstract": "How can a project-based learning (PBL) methodology and a synergy between students, professors, stakeholders, and the community impact innovation in design education and contribute to socially inclusive solutions? How can ethnographic research and a transdisciplinary approach contribute to adapting design projects to meet local community needs? This study examines a PBL initiative developed at IADE–Universidade Europeia (IADE-UE) in partnership with the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF), Portugal. Centered on sustainability and social innovation, the project involved design students in the creation of visual identities and product solutions for artisans in the Lisbon parishes of Santa Clara and Marvila. Through ethnographic research, transdisciplinary collaboration, and the application of ergonomic principles, students developed relevant design proposals to empower the artisans and the local community. Qualitative methods involving assessments by outside academics were employed in the research to evaluate the pedagogical outcomes and potential societal impact of the initiative. Outcomes demonstrate that the PBL methodology in question enhances students’ critical thinking, empathy, creativity, and capacity to address complex social issues while contributing to sustainable local development and encouraging a closer alignment between design education and real-world issues.",

    "Abstract": "Indonesia is currently facing a significant challenge known as the Middle Income Trap (MIT), a condition where economic growth stagnates after reaching middle-income status, hindering progress toward becoming a high-income country. This study aims to identify and model the socio-economic factors influencing MIT at the provincial level in Indonesia during the 2020–2023 period. The Generalized Additive Model (GAM) is employed to estimate nonlinear relationships between predictors and the response variable while capturing complex patterns in panel data. GRDP per capita is used as an indicator of MIT, with six predictor variables: life expectancy, poverty rate, informal employment share, secondary education completion rate, food insecurity prevalence, and population density. The results showed that the best model was obtained based on the minimum GCV and AIC values of the Gaussian family with an identity link function and 5 knot points with the highest correlation of 99,9%. Five variables show nonlinear effects, while food insecurity exhibits a significant negative linear impact. The findings provide a valuable reference for designing inclusive and adaptive eco nomic policies based on each region’s socio-economic characteristics to mitigate MIT risks and also supports the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8, which promotes decent work and sustained economic growth.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the factors influencing the potential audit findings in Design and Build (DB) construction projects in Indonesia, employing Structural Equation Modelling–Partial Least Squares (SEM-PLS) and Importance–Performance Map Analysis (IPMA). Data were collected from 100 respondents, including project owners, contractors, and construction management consultants. The SEM-PLS results reveal that Integrity Compliance Culture (β = –0.169, p = 0.045) and Administrative Financial Compliance (β = –0.193, p = 0.027) significantly reduce the probability of audit findings, while other technical factors such as planning, supervision, and team competence show no direct effect. IPMA highlights Integrity Compliance Culture and Contract Documentation Management as top improvement priorities. These findings demonstrate that governance and compliance dimensions are more critical than technical performance in shaping audit outcomes. Strengthening compliance culture, enhancing administrative transparency, and implementing robust contract management are therefore key strategies to minimize audit risks in DB projects. The study contributes to the applied statistics literature in construction management and offers practical insights for policymakers, contractors, and auditors aiming to achieve accountable and transparent infrastructure delivery in Indonesia.",

    "Abstract": "This study presents a robust formulation of the Spatio-Temporal Principal Component Analysis (STPCA) by integrating the Fast Minimum Covariance Determinant (FASTMCD) estimator into the spatio-temporal decomposition framework. Unlike classical STPCA—which constructs the spatio-temporal matrix from sample-based means and is therefore highly sensitive to extreme observations—the proposed STPCA–FASTMCD replaces the classical mean and scatter structure with robust estimates derived from FASTMCD. The method incorporates functional Fourier-based temporal smoothing and an inverse power–distance spatial weight matrix to better capture the underlying spatio-temporal patterns. Monthly climate data (thermal comfort, cloud cover, rainfall, and wind speed) from 24 monitoring locations in Bali during 2010–2019 are analyzed. Performance is evaluated using mean-shift analysis, eigenvalue-stability assessment, and eigenvector perturbation diagnostics. The classical STPCA produces inflated and unstable leading components, with the first eigenvalue reaching 63.36, whereas STPCA–FASTMCD reduces this value to 37.79 and yields smoother, more coherent spatial loading patterns. The robust STPC1 reveals a clear thermal–wind variability mode, enhancing the interpretability of spatial gradients relevant to climate comfort. Overall, the proposed formulation substantially improves the stability and climatic relevance of dominant spatio-temporal modes, providing a more reliable foundation for climate comfort assessment in Bali.",

    "Abstract": "The exponential growth of e-commerce platforms has generated massive volumes of unstruc tured user reviews, necessitating advanced automated analysis methodologies to extract actionable insights for strategic decision-making. This study addresses multi-class text classi f ication challenges by integrating BERTopic-based topic modeling with ensemble learning algorithms to analyze Indonesian e-commerce reviews. A dataset comprising 24,000 customer reviews from Google Play Store underwent systematic preprocessing and topic extraction using BERTopic, yielding eight distinct thematic clusters reflecting application performance, product quality, pricing, delivery logistics, and service reliability. The dataset exhibited severe class imbalance with an imbalance ratio of 65:1, where the dominant class represented 76.02% of instances while minority classes constituted less than 2.12%. Hybrid resampling techniques combining undersampling and oversampling successfully reduced the imbalance ratio to 1.4:1. TF-IDF vectorization transformed preprocessed text into numerical features, followed by supervised classification using CatBoost and Extra Trees classifiers optimized through randomized hyperparameter search with stratified k fold cross-validation. CatBoost demonstrated superior performance, achieving balanced accuracy of 0.829, recall of 0.829, and AUC of 0.965, attributed to its ordered boosting mechanism and capacity for handling categorical and imbalanced data. Independent validation of 2025 data confirmed robust gen eralization with prediction confidence exceeding 0.90, revealing significant temporal evolution in which product-related topics emerged dominant at 70.35%, pricing concerns increased from 6.58% to 16.57%, while application issues decreased from 76.02% to 2.51%. This research establishes a methodologically rigorous framework integrating unsupervised topic discovery with supervised ensemble classification, demonstrating computational efficiency while providing scalable solutions for automated review categorization.",

This study constructs and analyzes a differential equation-based mathematical model to investigate dengue transmission dynamics by integrating three control strategies: medical treatment, mass awareness, and the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. The basic reproduction number (R0) is derived using the Next Generation Matrix (NGM) method as a threshold quantity for disease transmission. Simulation results demonstrate that when parameter values satisfy the condition R0 1, the system trajectories converge to the disease-free equilibrium, implying that the disease will be eliminated over time. Conversely, modifying parameters δ and p such that R0 1 results in system stability at the endemic equilibrium, indicating disease persistence within the population. This study concludes the importance of controlling these key parameters through integrated interventions to reduce the value of R0 to less than unity",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Falls are a leading cause of injury among older adults, often resulting from dynamic balance disturbances. It is influenced by a complex interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic fall-risk factors. To identify individual fall risks, it is important to understand the underlying associations. Objective This study aimed to build an experimental setup modeling selected factors leading to a loss of balance, measured by the margin of stability (MoS) in an ecologically valid real-world example (tripping). Additionally, these analyses aimed to assess the feasibility and safety of the protocol and to explore the use of the MoS as part of a prototypical dynamic fall-risk model to differentiate between fall-risk groups. Methods Nineteen community-dwelling older adults (mean age of 71, SD 3.67 y; n=7, 37% women) completed the tripping protocol involving perturbations under various conditions. Clinical assessments were used to identify relevant fall-related intrinsic fall-risk factors. MoS was measured using an 8-camera motion capture system. Receiver operating characteristic analyses determined the ability of MoS to distinguish between low and high fall-risk groups. Results Approximately one-quarter of participants discontinued before or at the start of the tripping scenario because of discomfort or fear of perturbations, indicating that perceived safety is an important feasibility factor. Perturbations significantly disrupted MoS, with a median MoS of −106.05 (IQR –181.40 to –41.50) mm during the perturbed step compared to 114 (IQR 81.20-155.20) mm in the preperturbation step. Recovery steps showed progressive stabilization, with the second recovery step achieving a median MoS of 88.45 (IQR 47.50-137.80) mm. The second recovery step exhibited the highest predictive accuracy for fall-risk differentiation, with area under the curve values reaching 82.3% during slow walking with a series of right-sided perturbations. In contrast, fast walking with random perturbations yielded lower area under the curve values (64.9%). Slow walking conditions generally demonstrated the clearest separation between fall-risk groups. Conclusions This pilot and feasibility study demonstrates the applicability of a tripping paradigm to perturb MoS in older adults and provides preliminary insights into its association with fall-risk indices. While the protocol proved safe and feasible for fit older adults, perceived safety limited full participation. The findings are exploratory and intended to guide the design of larger prospective studies rather than to establish predictive conclusions. These data suggest that MoS during controlled tripping may help differentiate fall-risk strata, but confirmation will require adequately powered studies in more diverse and frailer older populations—and across multiple real-world scenarios—before any clinical implementation can be considered.",

Objective This trial aims to investigate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the KOKU digital strength and balance program for improving balance, enhancing physical function, and reducing falls risk among community-dwelling older adults. Methods This is a 2-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial. A total of 196 community-dwelling older adults 60 years and older will be randomized to either the intervention group, comprising a digital strength and balance program (KOKU) alongside standard care (strength and balance exercise advice and a falls prevention leaflet), or to a control group, receiving standard care only. Participants receiving the intervention will be asked to exercise 3 times per week following the tailored and progressive program. Randomization will take place after recruitment and baseline data collection. The trial’s primary outcome measure is balance function (Berg Balance Score) at 12 weeks post randomization. Secondary trial outcomes include lower limb strength, health care utilization and health-related quality of life, self-reported concerns about falling, self-reported physical activity, falls risk, pain, mood, fatigue, self-reported falls, and acceptability and usability of the KOKU program. Intention-to-treat analysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis will be employed for trial data analysis. Qualitative interviews and focus groups will be undertaken with around 10 care providers and 13 participants to further understand views of the intervention and trial processes. Results This study began recruitment in July 2024 and concluded in March 2025, recruiting a total of 202 participants (102 intervention group and 100 control group). Following protocol publication, data compilation and analysis will be conducted, with results anticipated to be published in 2027. Conclusions This trial will provide important evidence on whether a digital strength and balance program can improve balance and related outcomes in older adults compared with usual care.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to support medical interpreting and public health communication, yet current systems introduce serious risks to accuracy, confidentiality, and equity, particularly for speakers of low-resource languages. Automatic translation models often struggle with regional varieties, figurative language, culturally embedded meanings, and emotionally sensitive conversations about reproductive health or chronic disease, which can lead to clinically significant misunderstandings. These limitations threaten patient safety, informed consent, and trust in health systems when clinicians rely on AI as if it were a professional interpreter. At the same time, the large data sets required to train and maintain these systems create new concerns about surveillance, secondary use of linguistic data, and gaps in existing privacy protections. This viewpoint examines the ethical and structural implications of AI–mediated interpreting in clinical and public health settings, arguing that its routine use as a replacement for qualified interpreters would normalize a lower standard of care for people with Non-English Language Preference and reinforce existing health disparities. Instead, AI tools should be treated as optional, carefully evaluated supplements that operate under the supervision of trained clinicians and professional interpreters, within clear regulatory guardrails for transparency, accountability, and community oversight. The paper concludes that language access must remain grounded in human expertise, language rights, and structural commitments to equity, rather than in cost-saving promises of automated systems.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Males with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience worse outcomes than females, a difference not fully explain ed by comorbidities or sociocultural factors. We explored whether sex-based differences in biomarkers could account for this difference in risk. Methods Our study included 1,680 male and 1,204 female participants with non-dialysis-dependent CKD and 84 controls from NURTuRE-CKD, a prospective multicentre cohort study. Twenty-one biomarkers relating to kidney injury and fibrosis, inflammation, and cardiovascular stress were measured. Outcomes were kidney failure (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;15 ml/min/1.73 m 2 or kidney replacement therapy) and all-cause mortality. Multivariable Cox and Fine and Gray models assessed outcomes by sex. ANCOVA compared biomarker values between males and females adjusted for eGFR and urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR). Results: Sex differences in biomarker concentrations were observed in both controls and CKD participants. In male controls, higher levels of urinary Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor, Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases-1 and blood Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin, soluble Cluster of Differentiation 40, soluble Cluster of Differentiation 40 Ligand, soluble Tumour Necrosis Factor Receptor 1, Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1, and High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin T were observed. In males with CKD, additionally higher levels of urine Collagen Type I Alpha 1, blood Kidney Injury Molecule-1, Growth Differentiation Factor-15, and N-terminal pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide. were noted, while females with CKD showed higher urinary Osteoactivin, KIM-1, Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 and blood Fibroblast Growth Factor-23, concentrations. In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographics, kidney function, comorbidities, social factors, and medications, male sex was associated with a higher risk of kidney failure (hazard ratio (HR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.09–1.50) and mortality (HR 1.29, 95% CI: 1.05–1.60). Male sex was no longer associated with higher risk after adjustment for biomarker differences, kidney failure (HR 1.18, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.43) and mortality (HR 1.17, 95% CI: 0.98, 1.58). Conclusions: Male sex was associated with a higher risk of kidney failure and mortality, despite adjustment for demographic, clinical, and treatment factors. Males had higher levels of inflammatory and extracellular matrix deposition biomarkers. In contrast, females showed higher levels of matrix turnover and degradation markers. After adjustment for these biomarker differences, the elevated risk associated with male sex was eliminated, suggesting a biological basis for the observed sex difference in outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Although the effects of in-office and at-home bleaching on the surface properties of CAD/CAM monolithic materials have been extensively explored, their combined effect has not yet been investigated. This study evaluated the effects of different bleaching modalities, including a combination of in-office and at-home beaching in up to three sessions on the roughness, microhardness, and surface topography of five CAD/CAM materials. Disks of a resin nanoceramic (Lava Ultimate, Solventum, St. Paul, MN, USA), a polymer-infiltrated ceramic network (Vita Enamic, Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Säckingen, Germany), a leucite-reinforced glass-ceramic (IPS Empress CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein), a lithium disilicate glass-ceramic (IPS e.max CAD, Ivoclar Vivadent), and a zirconia-reinforced lithium silicate glass-ceramic (Vita Suprinity, Vita Zahnfabrik) were subjected to: 1) in-office bleaching with 35% hydrogen peroxide (Whiteness HP Blue, FGM Dental Group, Joinville, Santa Catarina, Brazil) (35% HP), 2) at-home bleaching with 10% carbamide peroxide (Opalescence PF, Ultradent, South Jordan, UT, USA) (10% CP), and 3) a combined protocol of in-office bleaching followed by at-home bleaching. Roughness arithmetical mean height (Sa) (n=12/group), microhardness (n=10/group), and topography (n=2/group) were evaluated before treatment and after the first, second, and third sessions. Data were submitted to mixed repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (α=0.05). Except for Lava Ultimate and Vita Suprinity, which showed progressive topographic alterations, 35% HP did not affect roughness, microhardness, or topography of any of the materials; 10% CP and the combined protocol caused topographic alterations in all materials. The 10% CP increased roughness of Vita Enamic (from the second session), IPS Empress CAD (from the first session), and IPS e.max CAD and Vita Suprinity (in the third session), and decreased microhardness of IPS Empress CAD (in the third session) and IPS e.max CAD (from the second session). The combined protocol increased roughness (from the second session) and decreased microhardness (in the third session) with IPS Empress CAD. The 35% HP affected the topography of Lava Ultimate and Vita Suprinity and was the safest bleaching protocol for the other materials, regardless of number of sessions. The 10% CP affected both roughness and microhardness of the materials most adversely and, together with the combined protocol, caused topographic changes to all materials.",

    "Abstract": "Examines childless marriage in Indonesian law through a maqāṣid al-sharī‘ah [objectives of Islamic law] perspective, with particular attention to the interpretation of ḥifẓ al-nasl [protection of lineage]. It analyzes how Indonesian positive law and Islamic legal objectives conceptualize reproduction, lineage, and family obligations in the context of contemporary childlessness. Using a normative-juridical and conceptual approach, the study examines Indonesian marriage regulations, especially Law No. 1 of 1974 as amended by Law No. 16 of 2019, alongside classical and contemporary maqāṣid literature. The findings show that Indonesian positive law does not explicitly prohibit childless marriage, but implicitly regulates reproductive responsibility through norms concerning the purposes of marriage and family welfare. From a maqāṣid perspective, ḥifẓ al-nasl is not limited to an obligation to have children, but functions as a broader principle of preserving legitimate lineage and social continuity, allowing interpretive space for circumstances such as health, psychological, and socio-economic factors. This study argues that childless marriage constitutes a dynamic normative issue rather than a dichotomous conflict between Islamic law and state law, and contributes a nuanced maqāṣid-based framework for understanding childlessness within Indonesian family law and contemporary legal discourse.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore athletes’ experiences of ‘reinjury concerns’ in those with lived experience of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury. DESIGN: Systematic Review with Qualitative evidence synthesis. LITERATURE SEARCH: CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, and ProQuest Dissertations were searched until January 2025. STUDY SELECTION CRITERIA: Two reviewers independently and in parallel screened studies for inclusion if they were: (1) Qualitative or mixed-methods; (2) included participants who were athletes with lived experience of an ACL injury; (3) reported the phenomenon of interest, ‘reinjury concerns’, within the findings; and (4) published in English. DATA SYNTHESIS: We applied thematic synthesis based on Thomas and Harden’s approach aligned to a constructivist paradigm, and followed relevant checklists for performing and reporting a systematic review and qualitative evidence synthesis. Confidence in the findings was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research (GRADE-CERQual). RESULTS: Forty-five studies were included, comprising 611 participants. Themes described how athletes assessed the threat of reinjury (theme one), experienced reinjury concerns across a multidimensional spectrum (theme two), and coped with reinjury concerns (theme three). Confidence in the findings was mostly rated moderate-high according to the GRADE-CERQual assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Athletes’ experiences of reinjury concerns after ACL injury were multidimensional and shaped by individual beliefs and contexts. Our findings support shifting from the narrow construct ‘ fear of reinjury’ toward a broader conceptualisation of reinjury concerns that more accurately reflects athletes’ lived experiences and may better inform assessment and clinical approaches after ACL injury.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Caterpillar hair-induced ophthalmitis (CHIO) is an inflammatory response of ocular tissue due to contact with caterpillar hair. This study aims to determine the epidemiology and risk factors of CHIO in rural Gujarat. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in a hospital in rural areas of South Gujarat, from August 2021 to March 2024. Medical records of patients diagnosed with CHIO were analysed. A total of 112 cases were included. To determine the prevalence of CHIO with background characteristics, univariate analyses were conducted using STATA 14 software. Results: Among 112 CHIO patients, 88.4% resided in rural areas, whereas 11.6% were from urban locations. The highest prevalence was observed in the 20–39 years age group (42%). Agricultural workers accounted for 69.6% of cases. Seasonal analysis revealed that 66.1% of cases occurred in winter, followed by 31.2% in monsoon and 2.7% in summer. The upper tarsal conjunctiva was the most commonly affected anatomical site (54.5%). Conclusion: CHIO primarily affects individuals living in rural areas and those engaged in agriculture. Winter months pose the highest risk. Preventive measures, including public awareness and protective eyewear for agricultural workers, could reduce the incidence of CHIO.",

    "Abstract": "Background In England, care homes are the primary providers of long-term care for older adults. The increasing recognition of the importance of social care underscores the importance of collaboration between the National Health Service and care homes. The lack of data sharing among stakeholders limits opportunities for co-ordinated care, service development and research. Objectives Identify how to support research, service development and innovation in care homes. Combine existing evidence with care home-generated resident data to create a minimum data set that is relevant and usable for stakeholders, including residents, relatives, practitioners, researchers, regulators and commissioners. Design and methods The study used a mixed-methods approach, structured into five work packages, supported by patient and public involvement and engagement with residents, carers and staff: Work package 1: Conducted two evidence reviews on outcome measures and factors enhancing research productivity in care homes. Work package 2: Created a trial archive for secondary data analysis. Work package 3: Conducted a scoping review, a realist review and a national survey to define minimum data set content and assess implementation challenges in English care homes. Work package 4: Linked residents’ data from National Health Service and social care data sets with data from study care homes, deriving useful minimum data set variables and assessing data quality. Work package 5: Piloted the minimum data set at two points in care homes within three integrated care systems, conducted focus groups and interviews with care home and integrated care system staff. Three national consultations explored how stakeholders use resident information, measure quality of life and minimum data set usefulness. Additionally, subprojects examined data availability in domiciliary settings, staff reasoning when assessing resident well-being and completing research during rapid policy changes. Findings The reviews revealed significant heterogeneity in outcome measurement and questioned the appropriateness of some methods and measures used for care home research. The Virtual International Care Home Trials Archive merged data from 6 United Kingdom randomised controlled trials with 5674 residents across 308 care homes. International minimum data set studies are a valuable resource for international comparative research. The wide range of measures used are mostly clinical with under-representation of measures important to care homes (e.g. quality of life). A national survey of care homes demonstrated the range of information, including clinical measures being routinely collected. The realist review identified motivation, front-line staff monitoring and embedded recording systems as important for minimum data set implementation. The pilot study recruited 996 residents from 45 care homes, with 727 residents’ data included in the minimum data set. Residents’ digital care records were linked to statutory health and social care data sets, creating a viable minimum data set prototype with metadata as resource. Conclusions The study provided an evidence-based critique of care home research and a resource for secondary data analysis for future research. It developed a prototype minimum data set linking National Health Service, social care and care home data, demonstrating its importance as a basis for discussions between health and care staff. Limitations The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted relationships and recruitment. Governance challenges prevented linking residents’ data to general practitioner records. Future work Future research should assess whether the care home minimum data set improves resident outcomes, service delivery, staff experience, cross-sector collaboration, resource use and digital technology implementation.

    "Abstract": "Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), driven by the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene, remains a high-risk malignancy despite therapeutic advances. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting BCR-ABL1 have significantly improved outcomes, but resistance and relapse persist, necessitating novel strategies such as combining TKIs with bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) like blinatumomab. Blinatumomab redirects T cells to eliminate CD19+ leukemia cells and has shown impressive clinical activity in Ph+ ALL when combined with Src+BCR-ABL1 TKIs. However, this contrasts with preclinical observations reporting that Src kinase inhibition by Src/BCR-ABL1 TKIs antagonizes blinatumomabmediated T-cell activation. Consistent with prior preclinical studies, we demonstrate that dasatinib and ponatinib, unlike SRC sparing TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib), antagonize blinatumomab’s T-cell engaging efficacy by potently inhibiting LCK Y394 phosphorylation, a critical step in proximal TCR signaling. This inhibition impairs T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and NFAT activation. To reconcile this in vitro antagonism with favorable clinical combination outcomes, we confirmed that the mechanism of SRC inhibition is T-cell intrinsic and explored the impact of interleukins. We show that TKI-induced T-cell suppression and antagonism can be significantly improved by supplementing co-cultures with common gamma-chain cytokines, particularly IL-7. IL-7 robustly enhances human T-cell proliferation, reduces exhaustion, and significantly improves blinatumomab’s cytotoxic efficacy in the presence of Src/BCRABL1 TKIs.",

    "Abstract": "Strawberry powdery mildew, caused by Podosphaera aphanis , is a major disease of strawberry, capable of leading to yield losses of up to 70%. Its management typically relies on frequent chemical fungicide applications due to the extended infection window of the pathogen. Podosphaera aphanis overwinters as mycelium and chasmothecia on infected plant material, which may act as primary inoculum in spring. This two-year study investigated the effectiveness of post-winter removal of infected leaf and plant debris in disease control and quantified the role of chasmothecia in early season infection under high-tunnel conditions. Complete removal of infected tissues delayed disease onset and reduced severity by up to 88%. In the two years, chasmothecium formation increased in late summer following 8 and 16 cumulative hours below 13 °C, respectively. In spring, ascosporic infection events occurred after the accumulation of 21 and 18 cumulative hours with temperatures above 10 °C combined with at least two consecutive hours of leaf wetness, consistently with previous findings. The efficacy of the sanitation practice was further supported by excluding the possibility that chasmothecia and/or chasmothecia on debris fragments potentially fallen into the substrate could trigger infection. In addition, we investigated the timing of ascospore-derived infections by monitoring disease progression on individual leaves. Infection rate was quantified across different leaf ages to assess their role in epidemic development and their potential contribution to secondary inoculum. The highest infection rate was observed on 15-day-old class age, with a crucial role in supporting early pathogen development. These results indicate the importance of sanitation practices, such as overwintering infected leaf removal in reducing early-season infections and informing more targeted control strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Electrocochleography (ECochG) has emerged as a valuable intra-operative monitoring tool in cochlear implantation, particularly for preserving residual hearing. This study evaluates the correlation between intra-operative ECochG responses and post-operative hearing outcomes in cochlear implant recipients. Materials and methods A cohort of 23 adult subjects with residual acoustic hearing in the low frequencies undergoing cochlear implantation were included. All subjects received Advanced Bionics' HiRes Ultra 3D implants and HiFocus SlimJ electrode arrays, with ECochG monitored during surgery via the AIM system. Intra-operative ECochG responses were categorized into positive, negative, and flat track patterns. Post-operative hearing outcomes were assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, focusing on hearing preservation. Results In 70% of participants, recordable ECochG responses were obtained, with positive track patterns correlating with significantly lower mean hearing loss (17.1 dB) compared to negative (27.5 dB) and flat patterns (30.7 dB). At the 12-month post-operative mark, 83% of all participants retained complete or partial hearing preservation, with 100% complete or partial preservation in subjects exhibiting positive track patterns. Discussion This study highlights the association between intra-operative ECochG responses and post-operative acoustic hearing outcomes, indicating its potential as a monitoring tool during cochlear implantation. While ECochG provides real-time insights into cochlear function, this observational study did not evaluate whether acting on ECochG feedback improves outcomes. Therefore, these findings should be interpreted as correlational rather than interventional. Future research should include larger cohorts and investigate whether integrating ECochG-guided strategies into surgical protocols can enhance hearing preservation and long-term outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Bone defect repair faces clinical challenges due to complex conditions caused by various factors such as trauma and aging. Traditional treatments have certain limitations, which seriously affect patients’ prognosis. As the core organelle of cells, mitochondria regulate the activity of key cells including osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells through functions such as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), production and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), regulation of Ca 2+ concentration, modulation of cell death, and immune response, as well as dynamic processes including fusion, fission, mitophagy, and transport. Moreover, mitochondria interact synergistically with the neuro-vascular-muscle axis, participating deeply in bone defect repair. This article systematically reviews the mechanisms and research progress of mitochondria in bone defect repair, providing a theoretical basis for the development of novel mitochondria-targeted repair strategies and facilitating the research and development of efficient clinical treatment regimens. This will help to develop new treatment strategies for bone defects. These strategies will be more effective, safe and targeted for individual patients.",

    "Abstract": "Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a ubiquitous plasticizer implicated in pancreatic carcinogenesis, yet the molecular initiating events and adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) linking exposure to disease mechanisms remain poorly resolved. In this study, we integrated a multi-scale systems toxicology framework—combining heterogeneous ensemble machine learning, Mendelian randomization (MR), molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD), single-cell transcriptomics, and in vitro assays—to delineate a candidate mechanistic trajectory. A Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Network (TabPFN)-enhanced ensemble identified a six-gene pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) signature (AUC = 0.946). Within this signature, MR provided suggestive evidence for a modest association between genetically predicted Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) expression and pancreatic cancer risk (OR = 1.188, p = 0.046). Functional enrichment of DEHP–PDAC intersection targets highlighted pro-survival signaling modules, including PI3K–AKT- and MAPK-related pathways. Structure-based analyses supported the biophysical plausibility of a non-covalent DEHP–KLF5 interaction (−6.4 kcal/mol), and 100-ns MD simulations indicated a persistent binding mode with conformational accommodation. Single-cell analysis localized KLF5 predominantly to malignant ductal cells and, together with CellChat inference, was consistent with malignant cell-derived TGF-β- and MIF-related signaling. Network-based virtual knockout further suggested that KLF5 may contribute to sustaining a TGF-β/MMP7-linked matrix remodeling program. Consistently, DEHP exposure upregulated KLF5 and MMP7 and enhanced migration and invasion of PANC-1 cells. Collectively, these findings support a working AOP model linking DEHP-responsive KLF5-centered activity to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and immunomodulatory communication, providing a mechanistic rationale that aligns with signaling programs characteristic of therapy-tolerant tumor niches, particularly PI3K–AKT-coupled survival signaling and TGF-β-linked stromal remodeling. Although these implications are hypothesis-generating, they highlight a potential avenue for future drug-response investigations.",

    "Abstract": "In the last 60 years, the broad spectrum of activity of nitroimidazole derivatives against anaerobic bacteria, parasites, and protozoa has permitted their use as the first choice of treatment for many infectious diseases. New compounds are needed to overcome the acquired resistance of bacteria and parasites. This work aimed to investigate 4- and 5-nitroimidazole derivatives in terms of the contribution of the position of the nitro group, along with that of different substituents, on their chemical, structural, and biological properties. Copper (II) coordination compounds with these derivatives were synthesized and characterized by analytical and spectroscopical techniques. Their structural properties and their intra- and intermolecular interactions were analyzed from single crystal X-ray diffraction studies. Theoretical calculations allowed for explaining the lability in solution of the copper (II) coordination compounds with the 4-nitroimidazole derivatives. The potential antimicrobial activity against anaerobic periodontal and opportunistic aerobic bacteria, including E. coli , S. aureus , S. mutans , and P. gingivalis , was evaluated. It is noteworthy that the position of the nitro group in the heterocycle drives their coordination behavior toward the metal ions, the geometry of the copper (II) atom in the complexes, and their stability in solution, thus affecting their biological activity.",

    "Abstract": "Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMOP) is a bone metabolic disorder characterized by reduced bone mass and deterioration of bone microarchitecture, and its early diagnosis is essential for improving clinical outcomes. However, reliable biochemical markers for the early detection of PMOP remain unavailable in current practice. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is an inflammation-related protein with oxidoreductase-like activity that participates in bone remodeling and metabolic regulation Mainly by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway. Nevertheless, its potential utility as a diagnostic compound in PMOP has not been fully clarified. The objective of this study was to investigate the plasma expression pattern of MIF in PMOP patients and explore its potential as an early diagnostic biomarker. Plasma MIF levels were significantly elevated in PMOP patients compared with individuals with normal bone mass (1.72 ng/mL vs. 0.58 ng/mL, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, MIF concentrations were negatively correlated with bone mineral density at the femoral neck (r = −0.548) and lumbar spine (r = −0.513), and positively correlated with bone turnover markers β-CTX (r = 0.417) and PINP (r = 0.350), suggesting that elevated MIF may reflect enhanced bone resorption and disruption of bone metabolic homeostasis. Further multivariate analyses identified MIF as an independent risk factor for PMOP and demonstrated its substantial diagnostic value. In conclusion, MIF,an inflammation-associated protein with oxidoreductase-like catalytic properties,may serve as a biochemical indicator of abnormal bone metabolism, providing a potential molecular basis for the early diagnosis of PMOP.",

    "Abstract": "Amid a surge in gender-based violence, with over 25,000 cases reported by Komnas Perempuan in 2021, a 50 percent increase, and more than 15,000 incidents in 2024, the urgency for transparent and inclusive legislative communication in Indonesia has intensified. The Indonesian Parliament’s official website (DPR.go.id) plays a critical role in bridging the gap between lawmaking and public understanding, particularly regarding the Sexual Violence Crime Law (UU TPKS). Using a qualitative based on interviews, field observations, and document analysis, this study investigates how the Indonesian Parliament’s (DPR) digital communication shapes civic engagement and institutional trust. Applying Ong’s framework of secondary orality, the study evaluates five communicative dimensions—interactivity, dialogic capacity, communal participation, simultaneity, and digitalization. Findings show that while the DPR.go.id provides digital tools, its lack of integration into a responsive framework results in digital silence, limiting meaningful public participation and fostering a trust deficit. The website functions more as a one-way broadcast than a space for reciprocal political communication. This study recommends enhancing feedback mechanisms, real-time engagement, and clearer access to improve public understanding and trust. The research contributes to digital political communication by offering a framework to assess digital platforms’ role in fostering inclusive civic engagement.",

    "Abstract": "Background Heart failure (HF) patients with pneumonia admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) face high mortality risks, yet current risk stratification tools lack precision. This study aims to evaluate the prognostic value of the red blood cell distribution width to albumin ratio (RAR) and develop a machine learning model for predicting 31-day in-hospital mortality in HF patients with pneumonia in ICU. Methods We included the MIMIC-IV cohort and an external validation cohort from the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. The restricted cubic spline (RCS), Kaplan–Meier, and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to estimate the RAR's prognostic value for 31-day in-hospital mortality. Boruta-selected features were used to build eight machine learning models. Results In the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care -IV (MIMIC-IV) cohort ( n = 3,158), RCS revealed a linear relationship between RAR and all-cause mortality. Patients were subsequently stratified into high- and low-risk groups based on the median RAR value. Kaplan–Meier analysis showed higher mortality in patients with above-median RAR ( P &amp;lt; 0.05), and each unit increase in RAR independently predicted a 13% higher mortality risk (HR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06–1.21; P &amp;lt; 0.001). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed RAR's prognostic consistency across demographic strata, comorbidities, and medication regimens. The LightGBM model, trained on Boruta-selected 13 optimal features, was identified as the best prediction model and demonstrated strong generalizability in internal (AUC = 0.735) and external validation cohort ( n = 1,110 patients) (AUC = 0.733). SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis ranked RAR as the second most critical predictor in the model. A web-based tool ( https://mengzhaoyang.shinyapps.io/PneumoHF-RAR_Predictor/ ) was developed for real-time risk assessment. Conclusions This study identifies RAR as an effective prediction biomarker for HF patients with pneumonia and provides a clinical tool for precise risk profiling.",

However, the long-term effects of Lp(a) on coronary plaque phenotype remain unclear. Objective To explore the potential association between Lp(a) levels and coronary plaque volume, composition, and progression using coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). Methods Patients with available data for Lp(a) and underwent baseline CCTA examinations between January 2009 to December 2015 and subsequently underwent a follow-up coronary CTA were retrospectively enrolled. Quantitative CCTA analyses measured plaque length, total plaque volume and composition volume. Patients were categorized into an elevated Lp(a) group (≥30 mg/dL) and a normal Lp(a) group (&amp;lt;30 mg/dL). The association between Lp(a) and baseline plaque characteristic and progression were investigated in linear mixed-effects models adjusted for clinical factors. Subgroup analyses were also conducted. Results Among 453 patients (mean age 64.7 years, 77.7% male) with a median follow-up of 6.15 years. elevated Lp(a) was linked to higher baseline plaque burden (all p &amp;lt; 0.001) and accelerated LAP volume progression ( β = 0.55 mm 3 /year, 95% CI: 0.04–1.06; p = 0.036) after adjusting for confounders. In addition, patients with diabetes, female gender, family history of CAD, or aged &amp;lt;60 years and with normal lipid profiles showed higher progression in total plaque volume and LAP, fibro-fatty, and fibrous components. Increased calcification volume progression was also seen in those with diabetes, female gender, smoking, drinking, or normal LDL-C levels. The association between Lp(a) and calcification progression was more pronounced in statin users. Conclusions Elevated Lp (a) level was associated with high coronary artery plaque burden at baseline and rapid progression of LAP at follow-up. Lp(a) may serve as a significant residual risk factor in seemingly “low-risk” populations.",

    "Abstract": "Background Elevated blood pressure may share a similar pathophysiology with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) has been associated with hypertension and CVD, evidence on the association between the AIP and prehypertension risk remains limited. This study aims to explore the relationship of the AIP with the risks of prehypertension and hypertension in a Chinese population. Methods This study was based on a population-based cross-sectional survey data of Fujian province and was conducted between August 2020 and April 2021. The association between the AIP and prehypertension/hypertension risk was assessed through multivariate logistic regression. Four-knot restricted cubic splines (RCS) were performed to examine the potential dose–response relationships. Subgroup analyses were used to assess the heterogeneity of the associations across different population subgroups, and an receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the cutoff values for predicting prehypertension/hypertension. The mediating roles of the two types of inflammatory indicators were analyzed through mediation analysis. Several sensitivity analyses were also conducted to further assess the robustness of the results. Results A total of 9,473 adults were included in the final analysis, including 3,273 diagnosed with prehypertension and 3,248 with hypertension. Overall, participants with elevated AIP levels demonstrated higher prehypertension detection rates and hypertension prevalence (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). The multivariate logistic regression model showed that the AIP was significantly positively associated with prehypertension [per 0.1-unit increment in the AIP: odds ratio (OR), 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03–1.07] and hypertension (per 0.1-unit increment in the AIP: OR, 1.11, 95% CI: 1.09–1.14), respectively. Compared with the lowest quartile of the AIP, participants in the highest quartile had a higher risk of prehypertension [OR: 1.58 (1.32, 1.90)] and hypertension [OR: 2.30 (1.86, 2.84)]. No evidence of a non-linear association was observed between the AIP and the risk of prehypertension ( P non-linea r = 0.178) or hypertension ( P non-linea r = 0.087). There were significant interactions between the AIP and both residential location and educational level regarding the risk of blood pressure classification ( P interaction &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, an ROC analysis indicated a higher clinical predictive value of the AIP for hypertension (AUC = 0.721, 95% CI: 0.708–0.734). White blood cell count mediated 10.91% and 15.52% of the total effect of the AIP on prehypertension and hypertension, respectively. Conclusion The AIP is positively associated with the risk of prehypertension and hypertension among participants ≥ 18 years of age in China, with white blood cell count potentially mediating a part of this association, which indicates that monitoring and maintaining optimal AIP levels may help prevent the deterioration of blood pressure categories.",

    "Abstract": "The use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies in oncology, such as wearable devices and smartphone applications, is gaining momentum due to their potential to improve quality of life, enhance treatment adherence, and positively impact survival outcomes for cancer patients. However, as a relatively new and evolving field, mHealth research faces a set of challenges in both study design and implementation. This article identifies key obstacles by drawing on preliminary experience from three mHealth studies in oncology: the eBladder study, the CHOPIN study, and the LAPSTAR study (ongoing studies at publication date). The topics covered are clustered into four categories: (1) planning and design (e.g., determining appropriate follow-up durations and inclusion criteria, defining digital support as an endpoint, developing response windows for digital questionnaires, establishing active measurement frequency); (2) technology set-up and study execution (e.g., aligning treatment and mHealth schedules, managing treatment heterogeneity and changes, establishing device configuration, scheduling data checks, determining end-of-study visits); (3) adherence (e.g., developing integrated platforms, balancing passive and active measurements, considering treatment goals as motivators, evaluating mHealth literacy); and (4) data reliability (capturing adverse events in real-time, ensuring device accuracy, and privacy considerations). This article also contains some practical recommendations in response to these challenges, meant to inspire researchers who are embarking on future mHealth studies in oncology.

    "Abstract": "Introduction Atrial fibrillation and flutter are heart rhythm disorders frequently associated with multiple other chronic conditions, complicating their management and requiring optimized care. Analyzing pre-atrial fibrillation and flutter comorbidity patterns could enable proactive, preventive, and personalized healthcare. Methods This population-based nested case-control study analyzed data from the Korean National Health Insurance Corporation (2002–2019). Adults aged ≥19 years with at least three years of recorded claims were included. Cases were individuals newly diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and flutter between 2007 and 2019 following a washout period (2002–2006). Controls were matched 1:4 using stratified random sampling. Using 5-year disease histories, BEHRT, a transformer-based model, predicted atrial fibrillation and flutter, while BERTopic identified sex-specific multimorbidity patterns. Predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results BEHRT achieved an AUC of 0.80 for predicting atrial fibrillation and flutter among 600,030 participants (8,661 cases and 591,369 controls). BERTopic analysis revealed sex-specific multimorbidity patterns: aortic aneurysm, hypertensive heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were common in males, while Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and rheumatic heart disease were prominent in females. Discussion The combination of BEHRT and BERTopic demonstrated the ability to predict atrial fibrillation and flutter based on multimorbid histories while identifying distinct sex-specific disease patterns. These findings underscore the potential for artificial intelligence to enhance personalized healthcare and optimize prevention and management strategies for chronic conditions.",

    "Abstract": "This research paper presents the results of a case study on how Romanian adolescents perceive poetry written by Romanian authors versus poetry generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) model. The study mainly relied on quantitative methods (descriptive statistical analysis using SPSS) and interpretive discussion of trends emerging from the aggregated response data. It involved a control group, which was informed from the beginning about the research variables, including the fact that they would evaluate both human-written poems from various literary movements and AI-generated poems produced using prompts based on texts from the same poetry volumes, and an experimental group, which did not know the texts’ origins. The experimental group was only informed about the origin of the texts at the end, at which point they were invited to re-evaluate the AI-generated poems. The aim of this study is to investigate how adolescents perceive and evaluate human-written poetry from different literary movements compared to AI-generated poetry. The analysis examines differences in emotional responses, perceived creativity and complexity of the poems, and how these perceptions are shaped by the author’s identity (AI or human), as well as by the respondents’ educational background and gender. The main findings reveal that adolescents’ perception of poetry is strongly shaped by authorial labels, with human poems receiving more favourable evaluations when their origin is known. It is worth noting that, in the absence of such information, AI-generated poems were often rated higher than those written by human authors. Once the authorship was revealed, however, AI-generated texts tended to be penalized – especially by female respondents and those with a humanities background – possibly suggesting a stronger attachment to “traditional literature” that influences their reception. Emotional responses also vary with authorship: human poems tend to be more often associated with positive emotions like happiness, while AI-generated texts tend to trigger negative emotions, particularly when inspired by specific literary movements and authors.",

    "Abstract": "Background Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a hereditary disorder primarily caused by mutations in COL1A1 or COL1A2 , leading to bone fragility and deformities. Although numerous pathogenic variants have been identified, novel mutations in specific populations remain underreported, complicating diagnosis and genetic counseling. Methods A Chinese family with mild type I OI was recruited. Whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing were used to identify and validate a novel splice-site variant in COL1A1 . Functional effects were assessed using two minigene constructs (pcMINI- COL1A1 and pcMINI-N- COL1A1 ) transfected into HEK293T cells, followed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequencing of transcripts. Results A novel heterozygous splice-site variant (c.298 + 1G&amp;gt;A) at the donor site of COL1A1 intron 2 was identified and found to co-segregate with the disease. Minigene assays demonstrated that this mutation induces abnormal splicing patterns, including partial and complete skipping of exon 2, resulting in frameshifted transcripts with premature termination codons. Conclusion The c.298 + 1G&amp;gt;A variant leads to aberrant splicing and likely haploinsufficiency, consistent with a mild OI phenotype. This study expands the COL1A1 mutation spectrum and supports the use of functional assays for clarifying pathogenicity.",

    "Abstract": "Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is an indolent leukemic B-cell malignancy that typically presents with pancytopenia and splenomegaly. Many patients achieve durable initial remissions with nucleoside analogs but ultimately relapse as leukemic cells acquire or exploit resistance mechanisms. Central to this resistance is the highly specialized leukemic microenvironment, particularly within bone marrow and splenic niches where hairy cells persist despite clearance of circulating disease. These protective niches provide CXCR4- and adhesion-dependent retention signals, cytokine support, and immune-evasion mechanisms that sustain leukemic survival, promote minimal residual disease, and ultimately drive relapse. In this Mini Review, we summarize how stromal interactions, extracellular-matrix remodeling, and disrupted immune surveillance reinforce therapeutic resistance in HCL, and how BCR and MAPK signaling interact with these circuits. Further, we highlight emerging strategies, including agents that disrupt chemotaxis, adhesion, and immune checkpoints, designed to dismantle microenvironmental support and improve the depth and durability of remission in HCL.",

    "Abstract": "Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) is the commonest inherited mitochondrial disorder. Dilation of the major cerebral arteries is seldom mentioned in MELAS because magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) usually shows normal findings. Here, we described a 24-year-old male patient with MELAS who had migratory vasodilatation of cerebral arteries on MRA and positive antibodies against contactin-associated protein-like-2 in serum during stroke-like episodes (SLEs). Moreover, a total of 18 MELAS cases were included in this literature review. MELAS with cerebrovascular dilatation was mainly seen in young adults and the commonest clinical manifestations were visual symptoms, headache, and seizures. Vasodilatation predominantly occurred in the acute phase of SLEs. Dilation of the major cerebral artery mainly happened in the posterior cerebral artery and the middle cerebral artery. The region of increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) always corresponded to the range of vascular supply of the dilated cerebral artery. Multimodal neuroimaging evaluation is very important for the diagnosis of mitochondrial diseases. Migratory vasodilation of cerebral arteries may be a specific imaging sign of MELAS. Dilation of cerebral artery together with increased CBF not only indicates the clinical onset, but also implies an upcoming stroke-like attack.",

    "Abstract": "Bile acids (BAs) have evolved from their classical role in lipid digestion to become central signaling molecules that integrate host metabolism, gut microbiota, and immune function. This review examines how diverse BAs regulate both innate and adaptive immunity through specific receptors—including farnesoid X receptor, Takeda G-protein-coupled receptor 5, vitamin D receptor, and retinoid orphan receptors—modulating the activity of macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, natural killer cells, and natural killer T cells. Tissue−specific BA signaling influences immune homeostasis in the intestine, liver, central nervous system, and tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, we discuss the pathogenic role of dysregulated BA signaling in inflammatory, autoimmune, metabolic, and malignant diseases, and evaluate emerging therapeutic strategies that target BA pathways via synthetic ligands, engineered microbes, and dietary modulation. Leveraging BA-immune crosstalk to advance research on precision immunotherapy and microbiome-based interventions is a promising area of research.",

    "Abstract": "Background Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a systemic autoimmune disease with overlapping features with systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis, and inflammatory idiopathic myopathies, characterized by anti-U1-RNP antibodies. Although subclinical retinal microvascular changes have been described in other connective tissue diseases, such data are lacking in patients with MCTD. Methods We performed a cross-sectional exploratory pilot study including patients with a defined diagnosis of MCTD according to one of the sets of classification criteria and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC), with elderly individuals equally distributed. Data on disease duration, renal function (creatinine and eGFR), and complement levels (C3 and C4) were recorded. All participants underwent optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) to evaluate retinal vessel density (VD) using parafoveal, perifoveal, and foveal scans, whole images, and foveal avascular zones (FAZs). Nailfold videocapillaroscopy (NVC) was performed in patients with MCTD on four fingers of both hands to assess microangiopathy patterns. Results Patients with MCTD (n = 20, mean age 60.6 ± 11.4 years, 85% females) showed a significant reduction in both superficial and deep retinal VD across all evaluated regions compared with 20 HC. In patients with MCTD, deep retinal VD was inversely correlated with disease duration (r = −0.6, P = 0.0003) and directly correlated with eGFR (r = 0.4, P = 0.05). In patients with MCTD, C3 levels were positively correlated with age (r = 0.4, P = 0.03) and superficial parafoveal VD (r = 0.5, P = 0.008). In MCTD, NVC abnormalities, including non-specific microangiopathy and scleroderma patterns, occurred in 60% (n = 12) of cases and did not correlated with OCT-A findings. Conclusion Patients with MCTD present subclinical retinal microvascular abnormalities detectable by OCT-A. Our hypothesis-generating study suggests that retinal vascular changes may be linked to disease duration, renal function, and complement levels. OCT-A may be a useful tool for assessing MCTD.",

    "Abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) provides therapeutic benefits to a subset of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, reliable predictors of treatment efficacy remain scarce. This study investigates whether RPB5-mediating protein (RMP) facilitates the alignment of redox adaptation with immune checkpoint regulation, thereby influencing the extent of therapeutic benefit under programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade. In Hepa1–6 and Hep3B cell lines, enforced expression of RMP resulted in elevated levels of NRF2 and PD-L1 proteins, alongside enhanced clonogenic growth and short-term migratory capacity. In a subcutaneous Hepa1–6 tumor model, RMP-overexpressing tumors exhibited accelerated growth and a distinct immunohistochemical profile characterized by increased levels of RMP, NRF2, PD-L1, Ki-67 and HO-1, indicative of a proliferative and redox-adapted state. Upon administration of anti-PD-1 therapy, both experimental cohorts demonstrated tumor regression; however, the RMP-overexpressing cohort exhibited a proportionally reduced inhibition compared to controls, despite experiencing greater absolute tumor shrinkage from a higher baseline. This suggests a limited response amplitude within the RMP/NRF2-high context. Post-therapy tissues from the overexpression cohort exhibited elevated levels of RMP, NRF2, HO-1, and PD-L1, alongside an immune microenvironment characterized by an increased presence of CD3/CD8 cells and a decreased presence of CD4/CD25 cells. This pattern is indicative of an inflamed yet suppressed state of adaptive immune resistance. Collectively, these observations support a model wherein continuous RMP–NRF2–HO-1 activity and persistent PD-L1 expression exert inhibitory pressure, even as PD-1 blockade facilitates cytotoxic T-cell infiltration. This dynamic accounts for the relatively lower inhibition observed in the overexpression context. The combined RMP/NRF2/PD-L1 signature proposes a mechanistically informed biomarker framework and suggests the potential for rational therapeutic combinations that pair PD-1 blockade with modulation of the redox pathway in HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Background Breast cancer (BC) is a common malignant tumor with high incidence and mortality rates. Mitophagy refers to a selective form of autophagy that is believed to be closely related to the occurrence and progression of BC. Identifying the mitophagy-related sites associated with BC can help us gain a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of BC, laying the foundation for early diagnosis and effective treatment of BC. Method RNA-seq expression data of BC were obtained from the GEO and TCGA databases. Differentially expressed genes were intersected with mitophagy-related genes from GeneCards to identify BC-associated mitophagy genes. Prognostic biomarkers were screened using Kaplan–Meier (K–M) survival and ROC analyses. Based on mitophagy-related gene expression and survival data, BC patients were classified into high- and low-risk subgroups for immune infiltration and GSEA analyses. Finally, IHC data from the HPA database and in vitro experiments, including siRNA-mediated knockdown, Western blot, CCK-8 proliferation assay, confocal microscopy and drug prediction were performed to validate the expression and biological functions of candidate biomarkers PBK and NEK2. Result Through dual validation of K-M survival analysis and ROC diagnosis-treatment efficacy analysis, we ultimately identified 9 mitophagy-related prognostic biomarkers for BC, and found their expression was significantly upregulated in BC tissues. In addition, the results showed that the degree of immune infiltration in the low-risk subgroup was considered higher than that in the high-risk subgroup. Inhibition of PBK and NEK2 will have an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of BC cell. Furthermore, clinicopathological analyses confirmed a genuinely higher risk in the high-risk subgroup, with PBK and NEK2 independently associated with risk stratification. Conclusion This study elucidated the prognostic value, immune microenvironment characteristics, and molecular mechanisms of mitophagy in BC, and identified nine mitophagy-related biomarkers. Among them, PBK and NEK2 were experimentally confirmed to promote tumor cell proliferation, providing novel insights for early diagnosis and therapeutic strategies in breast cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction The targeted-release budesonide formulation (Nefecon) addresses IgA nephropathy (IgAN) by inhibiting mucosal immune dysregulation in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), leading to reduced production of galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1). Randomized controlled trials (NEFIGAN, NefIgArd) have shown that Nefecon effectively decreases proteinuria and decelerates the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN). However, evidence in real-world clinical settings and high-risk subgroups remains limited. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study involving 60 IgAN patients treated with Nefecon (16 mg/day) for no less than 6 months at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University between October 2024 and November 2025. The study focused on evaluating alterations in proteinuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Subgroup analyses were further carried out according to the use of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, baseline proteinuria levels, and baseline renal function. Results Proteinuria decreased significantly after 4 and 6 months of Nefecon treatment (median reduction 31.9% and 43.5%, respectively; both p &amp;lt; 0.001), while eGFR remained stable. Patients receiving Nefecon plus glucocorticoid/immunosuppressive therapy achieved greater proteinuria reduction than those on Nefecon monotherapy (48.1% vs . 35.8% at 6 months, p=0.04). Notably, patients with a baseline eGFR &amp;lt; 35 mL/min/1.73 m² showed a 38.9% reduction in proteinuria (p=0.002) without additional renal deterioration. Nefecon was well tolerated, with adverse events being mild. Conclusion In routine clinical practice, Nefecon effectively reduces proteinuria and preserves renal function in IgAN, even in patients excluded from randomized trials. The combination with immunosuppressive therapy may provide additive benefit that requires further validation. These findings extend trial results to real-world settings and highlight Nefecon as a practical treatment option for high-risk IgAN patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background Emotional distress (ED) is closely associated with the progression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Xiaoyao San (XYS), a classical Chinese herbal prescription traditionally used for mood regulation, has demonstrated potential therapeutic efficacy in emotion-related breast cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms through which XYS mitigates ED-induced TNBC (ED-TNBC) remain insufficiently characterized. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects of XYS on ED-TNBC and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. Methods A TNBC mouse model subjected to chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) was developed to simulate ED-TNBC conditions. The therapeutic efficacy of XYS at varying doses was evaluated through behavioral assessments and tumor growth analyses. Multi-omics analyses integrating network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to identify principal active constituents and key molecular targets of XYS. Transcriptomic profiling, in vivo and in vitro functional assays, and molecular biology experiments were conducted to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying XYS-mediated regulation. Results High-dose XYS markedly alleviated depression-like behaviors and suppressed ED-TNBC tumor progression, with no evident adverse effects observed. Transcriptomic and molecular analyses revealed that XYS enhanced CD8 + T cell infiltration and cytotoxic activity through activation of Cxcl9. The active constituents of XYS were found to bind directly to the transcription factor Rela. Subsequent experiments verified that Cxcl9 secretion from TNBC cells depends on Rela activity. In addition, XYS upregulated Rela expression and promoted its nuclear translocation. Conclusion XYS directly targets and activates the intratumoral Rela/NF-κB–Cxcl9 axis, promoting CD8 + T cell infiltration and activation, thereby inhibiting the growth of ED-TNBS.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airflow limitation and chronic airway inflammation, traditionally managed with inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids. However, a significant subset of patients exhibits suboptimal response to these inhaled therapies, and disease progression remains challenging to control effectively. Recent advances in understanding the inflammatory pathways underlying COPD have led to the development of biologic agents targeting critical cytokines and their receptors, including IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), IL-5, IL-5 receptor (IL-5R), IL-33, ST2, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). Emerging drugs such as JKN2401, TQC2731, and tezepelumab demonstrate promising therapeutic potential by modulating these specific inflammatory mediators. This review comprehensively summarizes the pathophysiological roles of these cytokines in COPD, the current progress in biologic drug development targeting these molecules, and the outcomes of recent clinical trials. By elucidating these novel therapeutic avenues, the article aims to provide a theoretical foundation and clinical guidance for precision medicine approaches in COPD management beyond conventional inhaled treatments.",

    "Abstract": "Background The utilization of predictive models facilitates the identification of patients at risk, thereby enabling the implementation of individualized interventions. Despite the growing use of predictive models to estimate the likelihood of AKI in AP, concerns persist regarding their effectiveness in clinical settings and the rigor and relevance of forthcoming research. The objective of this study is to systematically review and evaluate predictive models for AKI in AP. Methods A comprehensive search of relevant databases was conducted, encompassing China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, VIP, Chinese Medical Association, PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane Library, with the search extending from database inception to 26 November 2024. The data from a number of selected studies was extracted using the CHARMS form, while the quality of predictive modeling studies was assessed using the PROBAST tool. A meta-analysis of AUC for predictive models and relevant predictors (≥2) was conducted using Stata 17.0 and MedCalc software. Results The total number of studies included in the review was 17, with a total of 9,949 patients and 37 predictive models. Of these, 32 models underwent internal validation, with an area under the curve (AUC) &amp;gt; 0.7. The overall risk of bias was high across all 17 studies, yet the overall applicability was deemed satisfactory. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that the pooled AUC for internal validation across 20 predictive models for AKI in AP was 0.790 (95% CI = 0.761–0.818); and the pooled external validation AUC for five models was 0.766 (95% CI = 0.684–0.845). The overall risk of bias was high across all 17 studies, with significant heterogeneity observed. However, the overall applicability was deemed satisfactory. Conclusion The predictive model for AKI complicating AP demonstrates moderate predictive efficacy. Nevertheless, given the elevated risk of bias in the majority of studies and the absence of adequate external validation, its clinical applicability merits further investigation.

    "Abstract": "Objective This study investigates the integration of different large language models (LLMs) into the Medical Cell Biology Laboratory Course (MCBLC) to enhance bioethics training for undergraduate medical students in China. It further compares the effectiveness of these LLMs in improving teaching outcomes and student learning performances. Key challenges encountered during implementation were identified, and potential strategies to address them were also explored. Methods First-year undergraduate medical students from three medical majors were assigned to five groups. The study involved three phases: instructor-led course introduction, LLM-assisted experimental practice addressing procedural, conceptual, and psychological challenges, and post-training evaluation via questionnaires and blind-graded laboratory reports. Four domestic robust LLMs (DeepSeek, Doubao, KIMI, ChatGLM) were compared to assess their impact on bioethics integration, instructional effectiveness, and student learning outcomes, while documenting students' perceptions and concerns regarding LLM use. Results The study demonstrated that all four LLMs supported first-year undergraduate medical students in consolidating foundational knowledge, enhancing bioethics proficiency during laboratory practice, and developing critical competencies for future physicians. Questionnaires from 86 students across three majors indicated generally high satisfaction. For Medical Imaging Technology students, DeepSeek (mean 4.3, SD 0.7) and KIMI (mean 4.3, SD 0.8) were rated significantly higher than Doubao (mean 3.9, SD 0.7) and ChatGLM (mean 3.3, SD 0.6). KIMI was also preferred among Health Surveillance and Quarantine (mean 4.4, SD 0.5) and Medical Prevention (mean 4.5, SD 0.5) students. Nevertheless, students expressed concerns regarding potential academic inaccuracies, bias, and possible impact on independent thinking. Conclusions This study suggested that recent LLMs, particularly KIMI and DeepSeek, may support integrating bioethics into undergraduate medical laboratory courses in a university in China. By assisting students in accessing information, reflecting on ethical issues, and navigating practical challenges, these tools can facilitate learning and foster ethical awareness, competent future physicians. These findings, as an initial exploration and context-specific, indicate that LLMs may support bioethics learning in undergraduate medical laboratory courses and help foster ethically aware, competent future physicians.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study aims to investigate the differences in clinical characteristics and prognosis between patients with HBV-ACLF (Hepatitis B Virus-related Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure) and those with ALD-ACLF (Alcohol-Associated Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure), and to identify risk factors associated with 90-day mortality in both cohorts. Methods This study enrolled 56 patients with HBV-ACLF and 83 patients with ALD-ACLF to compare their clinical characteristics and conduct analyses of risk factors associated with 90-day prognosis. Result Compared with the HBV-ACLF cohort, the ALD-ACLF group exhibited a higher proportion of male patients and a greater prevalence of ascites. Additionally, significant differences were observed in laboratory parameters, with ALD-ACLF patients showing higher levels of WBC (white blood cells), N (neutrophils), and M (monocytes) but lower levels of ALT (alanine aminotransferase), AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALB (albumin), K (potassium), and Na (sodium) compared to HBV-ACLF patients ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). In terms of prognostic factors, TBIL (total bilirubin) and PT (prothrombin time) were identified as independent risk factors for 90-day mortality in HBV-ACLF patients, while WBC, TBIL, and PT were associated with 90-day mortality in ALD-ACLF patients. Conclusion Patients with ALD-ACLF typically present with a higher prevalence of comorbidities, such as ascites and infections, compared to those with HBV-ACLF. However, no significant differences in prognosis were observed between the two cohorts. For HBV-ACLF patients, elevated TBIL and prolonged PT were identified as independent risk factors for 90-day mortality. In contrast, in addition to TBIL and PT, elevated white WBC was also associated with 90-day mortality in ALD-ACLF patients. These findings warrant further validation through multicenter studies with larger sample sizes.",

    "Abstract": "Background Hepatectomy, a commonly employed surgical approach for treating liver-related disorders, has emerged as the primary method for the radical treatment of early stage liver cancer. This network meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the impacts of different anesthetics on ischemia reperfusion injuries in patients undergoing hepatectomy. Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies were identified through searches in four databases, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science, up to February 12, 2025. Non-English studies were excluded, and this study was conducted in compliance with PRISMA-NMA guidelines. Bayesian network meta-analysis was employed based on the R 4.3.2 and Stata 15.1. The efficacy of each intervention was evaluated through SUCRA (surface under the cumulative ranking curve). Results The analysis included 19 studies with a total of 1,319 participants. In terms of reducing aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, the combination of propofol and sevoflurane exhibited the highest effectiveness (SUCRAs: 71.82%), followed by the combination of propofol, isoflurane, and fentanyl (SUCRAs: 61.87%), and sevoflurane monotherapy (SUCRAs: 58.61%). The combination of propofol and sevoflurane (SUCRAs: 71.94%) ranked first for reducing ALT levels, followed by propofol monotherapy (SUCRAs: 61.71%) and the combination of propofol and sufentanil (SUCRAs: 58.59%). Conclusion The combination of propofol and sevoflurane appear to be the most effective approach for reducing AST and ALT levels. This combination could serve as a favorable anesthetic strategy to limit hepatic enzyme elevations after hepatectomy, thus supporting liver function protection.

    "Abstract": "Background Sepsis is a burdensome and costly condition and a leading cause of death in acute care centers. Guided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) Framework, the Assessment of Implementation Methods in Sepsis (AIMS) study is an ongoing hybrid type 2 effectiveness-implementation study. One co-primary aim is to compare two multi-component sepsis “bundles”—one accomplished within 3-h and one within 1-h—and their effects on mortality and related health outcomes. The other co-primary aim is to assess implementation strategies that support bundle implementation within emergency departments. Implementation strategies include learning collaboratives, provision of educational materials, audit and feedback reports, capturing and sharing local knowledge, and technical assistance. The goal of this implementation-focused process evaluation was to identify barriers and facilitators to the implementation process and to develop subsequent adaptations to enhance implementation. Methods A multi-method data collection and analysis was undertaken in the Implementation stage. The two champions (one nurse and one physician) from each of the 18 AIMS study sites were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. Learning collaborative attendees completed quantitative satisfaction surveys. After analysis, potentially impactful and feasible modifications to the implementation process were identified, documented using the FRAME-IS, and enacted. Results Synthesis of 24 interviews and 19 surveys indicated that the implementation strategies were generally executed as planned and respondents were satisfied with the implementation process. Monthly learning collaboratives included helpful topics and facilitated inter-site networking and learning. Educational materials were valuable resources for onboarding and ongoing reference, and monthly audit and feedback reports helped to quantify progress and benchmark with other AIMS sites. Barriers and related adaptations were focused on simplifying and streamlining touchpoints and materials, further supporting inter-site networking and learning, and increasing knowledge of and access to resources. Fifteen adaptations (content = 7; context = 4; evaluation = 2; training = 1; and multi-purpose = 1) were made to increase the acceptability, appropriateness, or feasibility of the implementation effort ( n = 12), improve fidelity to bundles ( n = 2), and to increase adoption of bundles ( n = 1). Conclusion The implementation strategies were well-received and site-specific feedback led to modifications. The summative evaluation will provide insight into if and how modifications enhanced implementation efforts. Trial registration ClinicalTrails.gov , Identifier NCT05491941.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic Venous Disease (CVD) is a common vascular disorder, primarily affecting the lower extremities, with a significantly higher incidence in women. Pregnant women represent a particularly high-risk population for CVD. Early screening and assessment of CVD severity and progression during pregnancy are imperative for preventing Venous Thromboembolism (VTE). Despite its high prevalence, CVD in pregnancy often remains underestimated, frequently being managed by clinicians as a localized and benign condition. However, emerging evidence suggests that CVD may exert broader systemic effects, potentially compromising placental development and fetal well-being through alterations in the maternal-placental-fetal circulation. Nevertheless, the precise correlations between CVD and a spectrum of adverse pregnancy outcomes remain unclear. Also, the standardized management strategies for CVD in pregnancies are yet to be established. This review synthesizes current literature to delineate the present understanding and identify persistent knowledge gaps in this field. Furthermore, it aims to underscore the clinical significance of CVD in pregnancy and to propose pertinent directions for future research, thereby advocating for heightened clinical awareness and more investigative efforts.",

    "Abstract": "Background Dry Eye Disease (DED) is a multifactorial ocular surface disorder characterized by tear film instability and inflammation, leading to ocular discomfort, irritation, and visual disturbance. In Saudi Arabia, environmental conditions, ergonomic, and behavioral factors such as digital device use and contact lens wear may exacerbate DED symptoms. However, large-scale population-based studies examining the epidemiological and clinical determinants of DED remain limited. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated online questionnaire distributed across Saudi Arabia. The survey comprised four domains: sociodemographic characteristics, awareness and knowledge of eye health, behavioral and environmental risk factors, and clinical symptoms related to DED and contact lens use. Data from 1,009 participants were analyzed using SPSS version 29. Potential associations between DED domains and demographic or behavioral variables were examined using chi-square and t-tests, with significance set at p &amp;lt; 0.05. Results Among the 1,009 respondents, females represented 56.7%, and the majority were aged 35–44 years (29.3%). The mean domain scores indicated that “Irritation/Dryness” was the most affected domain (47.5 ± 22.8). The “Symptoms domain” was significantly associated with age, gender, marital status, education, and occupation ( p &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas the “Activity Limitations domain” significantly correlated with age, marital status, education, and occupation ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). Both “Eye Discomfort” and “Irritation/Dryness” domains were significantly related to gender ( p &amp;lt; 0.001) and lifestyle factors, particularly hours spent on phones and computers ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Prolonged digital exposure and female gender were the strongest predictors of increased DED symptom burden. Conclusion Dry Eye Disease is a prevalent and multifactorial health concern among the Saudi population, strongly influenced by demographic, behavioral, ergonomic, and environmental determinants. Women and younger adults with high exposure to digital devices are particularly vulnerable. Implementing public health interventions, including awareness programs, workplace ergonomics, and AI-based digital screening, may be crucial to reducing the disease burden and advancing Vision 2030 goals for preventive eye health.",

    "Abstract": "Background Breast arterial calcifications (BAC) are commonly observed as an incidental finding on screening mammography and have been linked to cardiovascular disease. Whether BAC is independently associated with stroke risk remains uncertain. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. PubMed, Embase, and Scopus were searched from inception to May 2024 for cohort studies evaluating the association between BAC and stroke. Eligible studies included women undergoing mammography with documented BAC status and subsequent stroke outcomes. Data on patient characteristics and vascular risk factors were extracted. Study quality was appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist. Random-effects meta-analyses with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation were performed to pool risk ratios (RRs) and mean differences (MDs). Heterogeneity was assessed with the I 2 statistic, and publication bias with Egger’s test. Results Ten cohort studies including 52,413 women were analyzed. The presence of BAC was associated with more than a twofold increased risk of stroke (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.58–2.75; I 2 = 64.4%). This association persisted after adjustment for age, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and menopausal status. Compared with BAC-negative women, those with BAC were significantly older (MD 7.07 years, 95% CI 5.44–8.70) and more frequently hypertensive (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.23–1.78), diabetic (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.38–2.02), hyperlipidemic (RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.07–1.51), and postmenopausal (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.00–1.59). Interestingly, BAC was less common among smokers (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.45–0.86). Egger’s test showed no evidence of publication bias ( p = 0.143). Conclusion BAC detected on screening mammography is independently associated with an increased risk of stroke, even after accounting for traditional risk factors. These findings support BAC as a promising, underutilized imaging biomarker of cerebrovascular risk in women and highlight the need for standardized reporting and prospective validation.",

    "Abstract": "Creativity has been consensually defined as an ability to produce novel and original ideas/works, a definition shared both by the general public and among scholars. Since creativity is one of the most important and unique cognitive constructs seen in human beings, ways to enhance creativity have fascinated researchers across a broad range of human knowledge domains - from the arts and the humanities to science and technology. The functional process of creativity has been actively discussed not only in psychology, but also in neuroscience, where research is uncovering its neural correlates. A great amount of neuroimaging research has focused on describing anatomical and functional adaptations in the brain following various types of cognitive learning and training, e.g., classes of visual art or music composition, courses of drawing, calligraphy or playing musical instruments. A consistent underlying mechanism of domain-specific creativity has not yet been revealed due to difficulties in defining creativity or due to lack of generalizability across different modalities. On the other hand, recent studies suggest that there is a relationship between domain-general creativity and functional connectivity in particular brain networks. In this review, we discuss whether there is evidence for brain plasticity induced by training in creativity and associated behavioral changes, as well as whether the observed brain changes are consistent with the studies of neurobiological underpinnings of creativity and the changes induced by cognitive training.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction The study investigated glioma patients after surgical resection of tumor tissue using postoperative functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess cavity-adjacent (perilesional) functional connectivity as a predictor of overall survival and functional recovery. Methods We developed an analytic method to quantify the postoperative whole-brain functional connectivity. Resting-state whole-brain fMRI scans acquired from 12 glioma patients following surgical resection were analyzed as part of a proof-of-concept study. In particular, connectivity of the resected perilesional area was compared to that of the corresponding contralateral homologue region, and the difference between perilesional and contralateral connectivity was calculated. To test whether the functional connectivity metric could predict recovery of neurological outcomes, we compared patients’ connectivity metrics from postoperative scans with changes in Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score between preoperative assessment and 6-month follow-up. Additionally, we examined whether the connectivity metric could predict overall survival by dividing the patients into subgroups based on their median survival time and comparing connectivity metrics. Results Our analysis showed altered functional connectivity between perilesional and corresponding contralateral regions following surgical resection of glioma. The connectivity metric from postoperative scans was significantly correlated with recovery of neurological outcomes, as reflected by changes in KPS from preoperative to 6 months postoperative period ( ρ = 0.97, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Moreover, individuals with survival times greater than 15 months showed significantly higher connectivity than those with shorter survival times ( p = 0.0016 and Cohen’s d = 2.74 in all subjects, p = 0.02 and Cohen’s d = 1.90 in the subset of subjects with Grade IV gliomas). Furthermore, we developed machine learning models based on functional connectivity features, and they were able to predict the survival time with an accuracy of 92% and predict the KPS changes with an absolute error of 5.84 ± 6.08. Discussion Overall, our study showed that resting-state fMRI from patients after glioma resection is relevant to their long-term neurological outcomes: decreased connectivity in the perilesional regions compared to the contralateral regions indicates less survival time and worsened functional outcomes. The reported analytics from postsurgical fMRI scans, combined with the machine learning model, could provide important prognostic information for postsurgical recovery management.",

    "Abstract": "Background Artificial food colorings (AFCs) are widely used, yet their potential links to cancer remain unclear. We investigated associations between commonly used AFCs and cancer-related molecular networks and prognosis. Methods AFCs-related targets were collected from CTD, ChEMBL, SEA, and TargetNet, and cancer-related targets from GeneCards, OMIM, and CTD. Overlapping targets were subjected to STRING-based PPI analysis and Cytoscape visualization, followed by GO/KEGG enrichment. Core targets were evaluated for differential expression in GEO datasets of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), colon adenocarcinoma (COAD), gastric cancer (GC), and breast cancer (BRCA), with GSEA for pathway characterization. Expression patterns were examined using GEPIA2. TCGA transcriptomic and clinical data were used to construct prognostic models via univariate Cox regression, LASSO selection, and multivariate Cox regression. Key genes were assessed using the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) and qPCR, and in vivo experiments evaluated tumor growth under AFCs exposure. Results Four high-exposure AFCs were analyzed. We identified 108 shared AFCs–cancer targets and prioritized 50 core targets. Enrichment analyses highlighted cancer-relevant functional themes, including cell-cycle regulation (cyclin-dependent protein kinase holoenzyme complex) and oncogenic signaling (PI3K–Akt pathway). Multiple core targets were dysregulated in GEO tumor datasets, and GSEA identified consistently enriched pathways across cancer types. TCGA-derived signatures stratified patients into distinct risk groups with significantly different overall survival. HPA supported protein-level differences for selected targets, qPCR indicated that Allura Red AC or Tartrazine modulated prognostic gene expression in cancer cell lines, and AFCs exposure was associated with accelerated LLC tumor growth in mice. Conclusion This integrative analysis suggests that commonly used AFCs may be associated with cancer-related molecular networks and adverse prognosis in NSCLC, COAD, GC, and BRCA, informing future safety evaluation and regulation.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Anxiety is common in patients with cancer-related pain, affecting an increasing number of individuals annually and negatively impacting prognosis. Limited methods are available for early identification of anxiety in these patients. This study explores the link between the OPRM1 gene's polymorphism and anxiety in cancer patients. Methods We prospectively recruited 76 patients experiencing pain from Yunfu People's Hospital and assessed them with questionnaires on anxiety, depression, quality of life, and other metrics before they commenced opioid treatment. Additionally, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores and opioid usage data were recorded. In situ hybridization was used to analyze the OPRM1 polymorphism rs1799971. Based on the available data, appropriate opioid dosage conversion relationships were established. Results This study found that 40.8% (31/76) exhibited anxiety symptoms. OPRM1 genotyping revealed 31.6% AA, 48.7% AG, and 19.7% GG genotypes, conforming to Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No genotype differences were found in morphine dosage or NRS pain scores. However, G allele carriers exhibited significantly lower anxiety scores (median 27.0 vs. 36.0, p = 0.017). Multivariate analysis identified G allele (OR = 0.15, p = 0.040) and antitumor therapy (OR = 0.10, p = 0.027) as protective against anxiety, while breakthrough pain (OR = 6.65), higher pretreatment NRS scores (OR = 2.80), and depression (OR = 61.03) were risk factors (all p &amp;lt; 0.05). Discussion Our study indicates that G allele carriers exhibit lower anxiety levels, suggesting a certain correlation between the OPRM1 gene polymorphism and anxiety in cancer pain patients. Furthermore, there is a need to pay increased attention to the psychological health of cancer pain patients with the AA genotype.",

    "Abstract": "Background Preterm infants face high risks of neurodevelopmental, physiological, and psychosocial challenges. Developmental care interventions have become essential strategies to improve infant outcomes and strengthen parental involvement in neonatal intensive care units. Objective This systematic review aimed to synthesize evidence on the effectiveness, implementation, and contextual adaptability of developmental care interventions for preterm infants. Methods A systematic search of six databases was conducted for studies published between 2020 and 2025. Thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, including randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, cohort, and mixed-method designs. Interventions analyzed included Family Integrated Care (FICare), Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), cue-based care, individualized developmental programs, and environmental modifications. Results FICare showed consistent benefits in breastfeeding, growth, neurodevelopment, and parental outcomes. KMC improved thermoregulation, cerebral perfusion, and behavioral responses. Cue-based and individualized care enhanced long-term cognitive and motor development, while environmental interventions yielded varied results. Contextual factors—such as parental literacy, infrastructure, and cultural norms—were key to implementation success. Evidence from LMICs emphasized the value of culturally adapted, digitally supported care models. Conclusions Developmental care interventions significantly improve outcomes for preterm infants and families.

    "Abstract": "Traditional medicinal plants are valuable sources of bioactive compounds, many acting synergistically and their therapeutic uses are increasingly recognized. In this study, we examined the antimicrobial activity, antioxidant potential, and phytochemical constituents of four traditional medicinal plants ( Verbascum sinuatum , Amaranthus spinosus , Carduus getulus , and Heterotheca subaxillaris ) from the Gaza Strip in Palestine. Hexane extracts of each species were used for phytochemical characterization using Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC and TFC) were measured, followed by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay to examine the antioxidant activity. The antibacterial activity was assessed using the disc diffusion method. GC-MS analysis revealed that each species contained distinct lipophilic compounds. The major classes of components identified in V. sinuatum included saturated fatty acid esters, phenolic antioxidants, and a putative alkaloid. A. spinosus contained oxygenated monoterpenes, fatty acid derivatives, and aromatic compounds. C. getulus was characterized by monoterpenes, diterpenes, fatty acid derivatives, and phenolic antioxidants. H. subaxillaris primarily yielded terpenoids, fatty acid esters, and phenolic compounds. Quantitative phytochemical profiling revealed that H. subaxillaris exhibited the highest TPC and TFC among the four species. Hexane extracts of H. subaxillaris , A. spinosus , V. sinuatum , and C. getulus demonstrated measurable antioxidant activity and inhibitory effect against Staphylococcus aureus , Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Among the extracts, H. subaxillaris exhibited the strongest antioxidant and antibacterial activities followed, by V. sinuatum , C. getulus , and A. spinosus . These findings highlight the importance of phytochemical profiling in the discovery of new potential bioactive compounds and support future endeavors to isolate valuable metabolites, investigate their biosynthetic processes, and any structure-activity relationships.",

    "Abstract": "A shift from synthetic chemical nematicides to bionematicides in plant protection has led to the development of Nemarioc-AL and Nemafric-BL phytonematicides to manage plant parasitic nematodes. However, there is a lack of information on the accumulation of cucurbitacin residues and the cytotoxicity of phytonematicides on non-target entities. The aims of the study were to determine the cucurbitacin residue accumulation after the application of Nemarioc-AL and Nemafric-BL phytonematicides in tomato fruits and to determine their cytotoxic effects on a eukaryotic (Raw 264.7 cell line) model system. Two separate trials for Nemarioc-AL phytonematicide and Nemafric-BL phytonematicide, each applied at 3%, were conducted concurrently on sandy loam, dark soil, red soil, silt soil, sandy soil, and sandy loam (+). Each trial was arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) and replicated six times. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2 H -tetrazolium bromide (MTT) viability assay was used to assess the cytotoxicity of Nemarioc-AL and Nemafric-BL phytonematicides, and the Annexin-V and DAPI apoptosis assay was performed on Raw 264.7 macrophage cells. In Nemarioc-AL phytonematicide-treated soil type, the highest accumulation of cucurbitacin B residues in fruits was observed on sandy loam (+) (37.1 ng/g), followed by red soil with 27.0 ng/g and then sandy soil with 21.7 ng/g, and dark soil showed the least at 20.3 ng/g. The phytonematicides were non-toxic at lower concentrations, ≤1.25 mg/mL. However, the higher concentrations (&amp;gt;1.25 mg/mL) of phytonematicides exhibited cytotoxic effects on the Raw 264.7 cell line, with 50% cell viability in comparison with curcumin (100 μM). The IC 50 values for Nemarioc-AL and Nemafric-BL phytonematicides on Raw 264.7 cell lines were 0.55 and 1.6 mg/mL, respectively. Similar to the MTT viability assay, the Annexin-V and DAPI apoptosis assay did show that the low concentrations of phytonematicides (0.313 mg/mL) had no signs of apoptosis or necrosis; however, high concentrations (10 mg/mL) had signs of apoptosis as opposed to necrosis. Therefore, the products can be used at lower concentrations to manage nematodes and avoid the toxicity of the products.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction The rapid advancement and adoption of CRISPR-Cas technologies in crop improvement has significantly outpaced existing regulatory frameworks, leading to inconsistencies in the global oversight of gene-edited organisms. As governments and international bodies struggle to reconcile scientific innovation with policy governance, a pressing need has emerged for methodologies that can translate biological edits into regulatory-compliant representations across jurisdictions. Traditional approaches often compartmentalize genomic and legal domains, lacking the formalism to bridge biological intent and compliance precision. These methods are typically static, unable to adapt to jurisdictional policy drift or incorporate real-time exemption logic, thereby undermining both regulatory interpretability and technical fidelity. Methods To address this gap, I propose a unified computational framework built around the novel GeneRegAlignNet model and the Constraint-Aware Policy Induction (CAPI) strategy. This framework embeds regulatory semantics directly into the learning architecture, enabling the alignment of gene-editing features with heterogeneous policy descriptors in a shared latent space. GeneRegAlignNet employs symbolic gating, contrastive manifold learning, and exemption-aware vectorization to predict alignment likelihoods between edits and legal categories with high precision. CAPI extends this model with a risk-calibrated policy optimization pipeline that accounts for policy evolution, regulatory variance, and jurisdictional priorities. Results and Discussion Empirical validation demonstrates improved performance in regulatory alignment accuracy and resilience to policy drift across a diverse set of gene-editing scenarios. By tightly integrating formal representations of molecular edits with dynamic, multi-jurisdictional policy inference, our framework offers a scalable and interpretable path forward in enhancing regulatory precision and global harmonization in the oversight of CRISPR-Cas-edited crops.",

Furthermore, a multi-output model for predicting the senescence quality of damaged pears during storage was constructed using partial least squares regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), and long short-term memory (LSTM). The optimal prediction model was subsequently selected from these. Results The results indicated that as storage time increased, the average SOD activity, CAT activity, POD activity, O2 -. generation rate, and H 2 O 2 content in pears with different injury levels gradually increased. Higher damage levels resulted in a more rapid change rate of senescence quality. The constructed SVR multi-output model was the optimal model for predicting the senescence quality of damaged pears during storage, achieving R 2 values above 0.95 for the prediction of SOD activity, CAT activity, POD activity, O2 -. generation rate, and H 2 O 2 content.

    "Abstract": "Rapid and non-destructive estimation of soluble solids content (SSC) is essential for tomato quality evaluation, yet the generalization ability of many existing spectral models remains limited when applied across multiple cultivars. In this study, hyperspectral reflectance was combined with a genetic algorithm (GA)–based optimization strategy to develop a robust SSC prediction framework applicable to diverse tomato types. Spectral reflectance and SSC (°Brix) were measured for 152 fruits representing 13 cultivars, including large red, medium red, red cherry, and yellow cherry types. To overcome the structural rigidity of conventional fixed-form spectral indices, reflectance spectra were linearly transformed to construct three novel indices: the linearly transformed difference spectral index (ltDSI), linearly transformed normalized difference spectral index (ltNDSI), and linearly transformed ratio spectral index (ltRSI). For each index, GA was employed to simultaneously optimize wavelength combinations and transformation coefficients. Under identical calibration and validation datasets, the GA-optimized indices consistently outperformed conventional two-band spectral indices as well as full-spectrum partial least squares models, while exhibiting markedly reduced sensitivity to tomato type. Across all validation datasets, the proposed models achieved coefficients of determination of approximately 0.80, with root mean square errors around 0.6°Brix and mean relative errors close to 10%. These results demonstrate that joint optimization of spectral index structure and parameters is an effective strategy for improving model robustness and transferability. The proposed framework provides a scalable solution for non-destructive SSC assessment and offers practical guidance for the development of low-cost, field-deployable spectral sensing tools for fruit quality phenotyping across cultivars and growing conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Jujube leaf black spot is a common foliar disease in jujube orchards. Precision spraying technology enhances pesticide utilization efficiency through accurate targeting and on-demand application, while simultaneously mitigating environmental risks. Methods In this study, 1,000 jujube black spot leaves with different disease severity levels were selected, labeled, and photographed. Chemical treatments were applied at varying spraying distances and angles according to the disease severity, with a water control group established for comparison. The control efficiency of spraying parameters on jujube leaf black spot across different disease severity levels and their physiological effects on the leaves were measured. Results The spraying parameters significantly influenced the control efficiency across different disease severity levels. For level 0 (prevention), a distance of 0.9 m and an angle of 0°; for level 1, a distance of 1.2 m and an angle of 0°; for level 2, a distance of 0.6 m and an angle of 40°; for level 3, a distance of 0.6 m and an angle of 20°; and for level 4, a distance of 0.9 m and an angle of 40°. The control efficiency showed a significant positive correlation with soluble sugar (SS) content and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). Among these, SOD and POD activities were identified as key physiological indicators for evaluating the physiological impact of chemical control on jujube leaf black spot across different severity levels. Discussion By investigating the graded control efficiency of spraying parameters on jujube leaf black spot, this study screened the optimal spraying parameters for graded disease control and identified key physiological indicators for evaluating control efficiency, providing a theoretical basis for the green control of jujube leaf black spot.",

    "Abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly deployed in English-as-a-foreign-language (EFL) education, offering adaptive feedback, automated evaluation, and personalized learning pathways. However, existing research overwhelmingly emphasizes AI adoption and performance benefits, while largely overlooking what happens when AI systems fail to meet learner expectations and how learners recover from such failures. As a result, the cognitive–affective processes through which expectation violations translate into disengagement—or are mitigated through recovery—remain under-theorized and empirically unexplored. Addressing this gap, this study proposes and tests a cognitive–affective recovery model of learner engagement in AI-supported EFL contexts. Drawing on Expectation Violation Theory (EVT), Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), and Digital Divide/Resilience Theory, the model explains how expectation violations influence engagement and how cognitive reappraisal and trust recovery mediate this relationship, while digital grit conditions learners’ ability to persist following setbacks. A two-wave survey of 298 Chinese EFL learners from urban and rural settings, including both university students and private institute learners, was analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Results show that expectation violations significantly reduce learner engagement, but perceived AI adaptivity narrows the adaptation gap and activates recovery processes. Cognitive reappraisal and trust recovery emerged as key mediating mechanisms, while digital grit moderated critical pathways by sustaining engagement under adverse conditions. By shifting the focus from AI success narratives to failure-and-recovery dynamics, this study advances theory on AI–learner interaction and offers practical guidance for designing resilient, trust-sensitive, and equity-oriented AI systems in language education.",

Methods Grounded in the Job Demands–Resources framework, this study developed and tested a mediation model using survey data from 924 Chinese elementary and secondary school teachers. This study delves into the positive role of social–emotional competence in mitigating teacher burnout and elucidates its underlying mechanisms of influence. Results Teachers’ social–emotional competence and teaching efficacy negatively predicts teacher burnout. Meanwhile, teaching efficacy mediates the relationship between social–emotional competence and teacher burnout. Conclusion Teachers’ social–emotional competence and teaching efficacy, as crucial individual resources, can mitigate teachers’ occupational burnout through dual pathways: “social-emotional competence, occupational burnout” and “social-emotional competence, teaching efficacy, occupational burnout”. This study provides both theoretical insights and practical implications for reducing teachers’ occupational burnout by strengthening teachers’ social–emotional competence and teaching efficacy.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Depression is one of the leading causes of avoidable suffering worldwide, and over 50% of patients do not respond to their first antidepressant treatment, which underscores the need for more effective alternatives. This clinical predicament urgently requires an effective solution. The core objective of this study is to clarify the clinical efficacy and application value of the triple reuptake inhibitor toludesvenlafaxine in patients with poor response to the first antidepressant therapy, providing a new basis for treatment options for this refractory group. Methods This multicenter study included 61 patients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ( DSM-V ) criteria for depression. All patients still had a Montgomery Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of ≥24 after 4 weeks of treatment with an adequate single initial antidepressant, and were clearly classified as an ineffective or partially effective initial antidepressant treatment. Patients were switched to toludesvenlafaxine for an 8-week treatment period. The primary outcome measure was the change in MADRS score from baseline to 8 weeks. The secondary outcome measures included the changes in the scores of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), the Dimensional Anhedonia Rating Scale (DARS), the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire, Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), and the Clinical Global Impression of Severity Scale (CGI-S) from baseline to 8 weeks. Results For such patients that did not respond to the first treatment, significant and rapid efficacy was demonstrated after switching to toludesvenlafaxine. At 8 weeks of treatment, the average MADRS score of the patients decreased by 15.5 points compared with the baseline (95% CI, −17.7 to −13.3; p &amp;lt; 0.0001; Cohen’s d = 2.35). Forty-three percent of them met the clinical remission, and 67% achieved a clinical response. More clinically significant is that the therapeutic effect emerged at an early stage—2 weeks (95% CI, −9.4 to −6.4; p &amp;lt; 0.0001; Cohen’s d = 1.52) and 4 weeks (95% CI, −13.3 to −9.8; p &amp;lt; 0.0001; Cohen’s d = 2.11). After 2 weeks of treatment, there were statistically significant differences in the HAMA, Q-LES-Q-SF, and CGI-S scores at each time point compared with the baseline. The improvement in the DARS score was statistically significant from 4 weeks. In terms of safety, the most common adverse reactions were palpitations, constipation, nausea, vomiting, hypoesthesia, and dizziness, which are mostly mild to moderate and controllable. In particular, the drug significantly improved sexual dysfunction (95% CI, −4.3 to −0.7; p = 0.0071), which is crucial for improving treatment compliance. Conclusion This study confirmed that toludesvenlafaxine not only has significant clinical efficacy (including early onset, high remission, and response) for patients with depression who did not respond to the first antidepressant treatment, but also has good safety and can improve sexual dysfunction that affects compliance. This result highlights the significant position of toludesvenlafaxine in addressing the key clinical challenge of first treatment failure, providing a highly valuable new option for the subsequent treatment of such patients.",

    "Abstract": "Background This study assesses the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities, functioning, and adjustment difficulties of patients undergoing different gender-affirming treatment stages at the centralized Gender Identity Disorder (GID) clinic in Hong Kong. Method This cross-sectional study consecutively recruited patients with gender dysphoria according to the DSM-5 criteria in the GID clinic from Oct 2017 to Aug 2018. They were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Axis I disorders (SCID-I) and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Axis II personality disorders (SCID-II). Depressive and anxiety symptoms, self-esteem, quality of life and social functioning were measured. Results Eighty-nine subjects were recruited. The current and lifetime prevalence of DSM-IV Axis I disorders were 12.4% and 46.1% respectively. Prevalence of personality disorder was 36%. Among the current and lifetime Axis I disorders, depressive disorders were the most common (10.1%, 39.3%). Avoidant personality disorder was the most common Axis II disorder (16.9%). In regression analyses, subjects who received gender-affirming surgery and gender-affirming hormone therapy were associated with better overall (p = 0.034) and psychological domain (p &amp;lt; 0.001) of quality of life and self-esteem (p = 0.033). Gender-affirming hormone therapy alone was associated with better psychological domain (p = 0.001) of quality of life and lower levels of depressive symptoms (p = 0.049). Higher perceived social support was associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms (p &amp;lt; 0.001), better overall (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and psychological domain (p&amp;lt;0.001) of quality of life, and self-esteem (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions Lifetime comorbidity is common in Hong Kong GID Clinic patients with gender dysphoria. Gender-affirming treatments and social support are linked to a better quality of life and self-esteem. Hormone therapy and social support are associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms. Our finding preliminarily suggested better mental health and adjustment in patients with favorable social support who received gender-affirming treatments.",

Methods Altogether, 38 individuals with burnout (13 men and 25 women) in the age 24–55 were included in the study. The burnout cases were divided into three groups based on self-reported physical activity level. Results The burnout cases who reported that they were sedentary exhibited significantly higher insulin levels during the OGTT compared to burnout cases reporting that they were physically active to any degree. This relationship was independent of severity of symptoms of burnout and depression. Conclusions The observed higher insulin levels in the sedentary burnout cases indicate an increased diabetes risk in these individuals and point at an important reason for physical activity being included in the treatment regimen for this patient group.",

    "Abstract": "Background The prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) among steelworkers is high due to occupational exposures including high temperatures, vibrating tools, and intense physical loads. Given the varying prevalence estimates and associated risk factors of WMSDs among existing studies and the lack of a meta-analysis dedicated specifically to steelworkers, this meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively evaluate the prevalence of and risk factors associated with WMSDs among steelworkers. Methods A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Scopus, Ovid Medline, Wanfang Data, VIP Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and China Biomedical Literature Service System (SinoMed) databases for published studies reporting the prevalence of and factors associated with WMSDs among steelworkers was performed. Two reviewers independently screened citations, extracted information, and performed quality assessment of the included studies. Results Analysis of 35 studies comprising 38,774 participants revealed an annual prevalence of WMSDs of 69.2% (95% CI 56.7%−81.7%) among steelworkers. Subgroup analysis revealed a yearly prevalence rate of WMSDs in Asian nations of 72.1% (95% CI 53.3%−91.0%), which was greater than that for non-Asian countries. The annual prevalence rates reported for 2011–2025 differed significantly from those for 2000–2010 [78.0% (95% CI 67.1%−88.8%) vs. 55.5% (95% CI 40.3%−70.7%), respectively], with lower back injury accounting for the highest annual prevalence [57.2% (95% CI 50.0%−64.5%)], followed by the shoulders and neck [44.7% (95% CI 29.4%−60.0%) and 42.1% (95% CI 27.8%−56.4%), respectively]. At most anatomical sites, except the elbow and hip/leg, the 12-month prevalence was higher than the 7-day prevalence. Risk factors for WMSDs among steelworkers included age ≥30 years, smoking, psychosocial vulnerability, night-shift work, prolonged working hours, use of vibrating tools, lifting heavy loads, low education, high-risk jobs, and poor posture. Scheduled rest breaks were a protective factor. Conclusion Steelworkers exhibited a substantial annual prevalence of WMSDs (69.2%), predominantly affecting the lower back, neck, shoulders, and knees. Prioritized implementation of integrated interventions is critical for ergonomic tool optimization, mechanical lifting assistance, targeted health training programs, and systematic high-risk group surveillance to reduce disease burden and safeguard worker wellbeing.

    "Abstract": "Background Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) are highly prevalent among coal miners and pose a significant threat to occupational health. Understanding the underlying risk factors and developing a predictive model for WMSD risk can help to mitigate WMSD. Objective To identify key determinants of WMSD among coal miners in Jinang, China, and construct a predictive model to assess risk. Methods One thousand four hundred nine coal miners from two coal mining companies were surveyed using the modified Chinese Muscle Questionnaire (CMQ). Prevalence rates and risk factors were assessed using logistic regression. Machine learning algorithms were applied to construct the predictive model. Results The 12-month overall prevalence of WMSD was 82%, with the neck (59.5%), shoulders (53.4%), and lower back (46.5%) being the most affected. Eight variables, including smoking behaviors, perceived health status, and uncomfortable working posture, were significantly associated with WMSD ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). The neural network model achieved the highest performance (area under the curve: 0.886 on training and 0.704 on test). The fused model outperformed individual models in the final stacking integration learning. Conclusion Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are highly prevalent among Chinese coal miners and are influenced by personal and work-related factors. Machine learning models, particularly ensemble approaches, offer promise for risk prediction and targeted prevention.",

    "Abstract": "Background China is actively promoting cancer drugs insurance (CDI) to alleviate the growing burden of cancer. However, the efficacy of risk information frameworks supplied to consumers in expanding CDI coverage remains poorly understood. Purpose This study aimed to examine the impact of the risk information framework (RIF) on individuals’ CDI purchase decisions, as well as the roles played by time orientation and perceived risk within these frameworks. Methods This nationwide online survey enrolled 5,583 eligible participants aged from 18 to 60 years old in August 2025 in China. A randomized survey-based experiment with the designed risk information frameworks was conducted to elicit CDI purchase decisions. Participants were exposed to either a low-risk information framework (LRIF) or a high-risk information framework (HRIF) before making CDI purchase decisions. Descriptive statistics and mediating effect models were used to analyze participants’ decisions to purchase CDI. Results Among 2,825 eligible participants in LRIF, 364 (12.9%) were not insured by CDI, and 1,507 (53.3%) were insured by long-term CDI schemes (selected the option of 3 years). Among 2,758 eligible participants in HRIF, 99 (3.6%) were not insured by CDI, and 1881 (68.2%) were insured by long-term CDI schemes. Under LRIF, the mediating effects of perceived risk between present-oriented attitude and CDI purchase were −0.030 [95%CI: −0.072, −0.003], and between future-oriented attitude and CDI purchase were 0.089 [95%CI: 0.064, 0.118]. Under HRIF, the corresponding mediating effects of perceived risk were −0.006 [95%CI: −0.024, −0.001] and 0.022 [95%CI: 0.010, 0.038]. Conclusion HRIF could stimulate an individual’s CDI adoption. The underlying mechanism may be that HRIF restrains a present-oriented attitude and reinforces a future-oriented one, with perceived risk as a mediating factor. These findings underscore the need to emphasize RIF designs to promote CDI coverage.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Adolescence is a period notable for increased risk-taking behaviors, including substance use (SU). Longitudinal work has linked behavioral disinhibition, particularly impulsive dispositions and externalizing tendencies with SU, but the underlying neurobiological manifestations remain less well-defined. This study examined whether individual differences in reward-related striatal activity and impulsivity predicted mental health (externalizing symptoms) and SU outcomes (cannabis, nicotine, alcohol) over a year later. Methods Adolescents ( n = 140; M age = 14.9 years) from a larger longitudinal cohort completed a Monetary Incentive Delay (MID) fMRI task at baseline along with a measure of self-reported impulsivity. At follow-up, they reported externalizing symptoms and days of cannabis, e-cigarette, and alcohol use. Task behavior [response times [RTs], hit rates [HRs]] and striatal responses to anticipatory gain cues were extracted. Serial mediation models tested whether impulsivity and externalizing mediated an association between striatal activity and subsequent SU. Results Behaviorally, gain cues elicited faster target-related RTs and higher HRs (vs. loss or neutral trials), and performance scaled with incentive magnitude. Gain (vs. neutral) cues elicited greater bilateral caudate activity where more left caudate activity correlated with faster RTs and lower impulsivity. Serial mediation revealed that less left striatal activity during reward anticipation linked with higher impulsivity, which predicted more subsequent externalizing symptoms that, in turn, linked with more cannabis [indirect effect = −0.01, 95%CI (−0.04, −0.001)] and e-cigarette use days [indirect effect = −0.02, 95%CI (–0.05, −0.004)]. No indirect or direct effects emerged for alcohol use. Conclusions These findings suggest blunted striatal activity may reflect reduced motivational drive for lower-intensity rewards (e.g., fictitious MID monetary gains), which contribute to SU vulnerability via heightened behavioral disinhibition in pursuit of higher-intensity stimulation. Intervention strategies that upregulate everyday reward value and strengthen self-regulation may offer utility in reducing teen SU.",

A comprehensive dataset of joint configurations and end-effector poses annotated with voxelized collision status enables the training of predictive models across multiple system configurations ranging from 5 to 9 degrees of freedom. Leveraging expansive simulation-derived datasets, as well as clinical assessment through simulated X-ray generation, the models are trained and validated, achieving sub-millimetric positional accuracy and sub-degree angular precision while delivering real-time inference that surpasses conventional methods in scalability, robustness, and computational latency.

    "Abstract": "Aim This study aimed to analyse root canal configurations in permanent maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth using cone-beam CT among a Pakistani subpopulation. Method A total of 7,653 maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth were included from the retrospective analysis of 707 CBCT scans from two institutions. The CBCT images were visualized using GALAXIS integrated within the Sirona Dental System. The scanning parameters were standardized at 85 kV, 7 mA, with a 15-second exposure time and a voxel size of 0.16 mm. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26, employing the Chi-square test with a significance level set at p &amp;lt; 0.05. Results The predominant root canal configuration observed across all maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth was single root with single canal ( 1 TN 1) , comprising 84.66% of cases. Significant variations were noted in maxillary lateral incisors and mandibular canines across different age groups ( p &amp;lt; 0.05), indicating age-related differences in root canal morphology in these teeth. Gender-based analysis revealed significant differences in root canal configurations for maxillary canines and mandibular central and lateral incisors ( p &amp;lt; 0.05), with females exhibiting a higher prevalence of specific variants compared to males. Conclusion The study successfully identified the predominant root canal configurations in a Pakistani subpopulation, revealing significant age and gender-related differences. The predominance of the single root with single ( 1 TN 1 ) canal configuration underscores its clinical relevance and prevalence across different demographic factors. The findings emphasize the importance of demographic considerations in endodontic treatment planning, contributing valuable regional data to the field.",

    "Abstract": "This article investigates the persistent implementation gap in urban climate governance through an ethnographic study of Los Angeles's municipal climate planners. While cities are increasingly cast as climate leaders, celebrated for their innovation and proximity to communities, their climate plans often remain symbolic and aspirational. Drawing on two years of participant observation and interviews inside Los Angeles City Hall, this article develops a typology of nine categorical barriers that obstruct implementation, spanning institutional, political, bureaucratic, epistemic, scalar, economic, infrastructural, social, and legal domains. These barriers are dynamic and compounding forces that emerge through specific institutional, political, and material configurations, often shifting roles across contexts and over time. The article illustrates how bureaucrats and planners navigate fragmented systems, shifting mandates, and regulatory constraints through informal coordination, relational labor, and ad hoc improvisation. In addition, the article identifies enabling conditions that temporarily stabilize action under constraint, often arising from fragile alignments of actors, mandates, resources, and informal practices. These enabling mechanisms emerge contingently and unevenly, often through fragile alignments of actors, tools, and opportunity. By shifting attention from plan design to everyday governance practice and implementation, this article contributes to critical debates on the limits of urban climate leadership, the politics of municipal capacity, and the infrastructural labor of implementation. The case of Los Angeles illustrates how implementation gaps are expressions of deeper structural tensions between climate ambition and municipal constraint.",

    "Abstract": "Immersive virtual reality has surfaced as a revolutionary instrument in psychology, clinical practice, and neuroscience creating unique opportunities to explore embodiment, identity, and therapeutic applications. This review advances the field by reframing embodiment as a core psychological mechanism linking perception, identity, and therapeutic change in immersive virtual reality. Embodiment in VR functions as a psychological process through which perceptual, emotional, and identity-level changes emerge. These processes have demonstrated relevance to clinical practice, including pain management, cognitive rehabilitation, and interventions for anxiety, depression, and social phobia. This mini review synthesizes current research across these domains, highlighting the mechanisms through which VR shapes self-perception and psychological functioning. By integrating findings from empirical studies and theoretical frameworks, the review identifies both opportunities and limitations in VR research and practice, providing a foundation for future investigations into its potential to enhance wellbeing and support personal transformation. By reframing embodiment as an active process rather than a perceptual illusion, this review clarifies how immersive VR can produce both immediate experiential effects and long-term changes in self-perception and therapeutic outcomes. However, it also highlights that current research has gaps in theoretical clarity and methodology, emphasizing the need for more personalized, accessible, empirical and long-term studies in the future.",

    "Abstract": "The liver encompasses the portal vein, hepatic arteries, hepatic veins, and biliary ducts, all of which display considerable anatomical variation with clinical and surgical relevance. This study aimed to summarize this anatomical variability and its impact on decision-making in surgery. A review of studies and case reports was conducted, focusing on documented anatomical variations. The most commonly observed variations were highlighted using imaging findings. The study found that the anatomy of the liver’s vascular and biliary systems differs in up to 50% of cases; therefore, in hepato-pancreato-biliary surgery, the surgeon’s radiology knowledge and pre-operative planning with a specialized radiologist are particularly important. Pre-operative collaboration with radiologists would allow for more accurate mapping of the vascular and biliary anatomy. This review highlights the necessity of precise knowledge of liver anatomy and the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between radiologists, surgeons, and oncologists to improve patient outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Sugarcane is an important economic crop, and key phenotypic traits such as plant height and leaf area play a crucial role in yield potential assessment and breeding selection. However, the quantification of these traits currently relies mainly on inefficient and destructive manual measurements, making it difficult to achieve continuous monitoring of plant growth. To address this limitation, this study integrates a YOLOv8x-seg instance segmentation model with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and proposes a non-contact, high-precision 3D phenotyping method based on low-cost data acquisition using a smartphone. Multi-view RGB images are first processed using YOLOv8x-seg to extract plant foreground masks, which are then used as inputs for 3DGS-based reconstruction to generate 3D models. Plant height is automatically measured from the reconstructed models, while leaf area extraction involves a semi-automatic workflow combining image processing and manual steps. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach enables accurate trait estimation, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9644 for plant height estimation (evaluated on a subset of 15 plants, with a mean absolute percentage error of approximately 1.5%) and an R2 of 0.8551 for leaf area estimation (validated on 10 plants). Ground-truth plant height was measured using a telescopic measuring rod, and leaf area was determined through destructive measurement with a leaf area meter (LI-COR Model LI-3000A). Ground-truth plant height values were obtained using a telescopic measuring rod, and leaf area was determined through destructive measurement with a leaf area meter (LI-COR Model LI-3000A). This method demonstrates the feasibility of using consumer-grade devices for high-fidelity 3D phenotyping and offers an effective approach for high-throughput sugarcane breeding applications.",

    "Abstract": "Soil phosphorus (P) deficiency is an important factor limiting plant growth in the semi-arid Loess Plateau region in China. The topsoils in this area undergo repeated drying–rewetting (DRW) cycles, which can influence soil P availability, a process that may become more pronounced due to climate change. However, little is known about how soil P availability responds to DRW cycles under different land-use types. To investigate this issue, we conducted three 120-day soil culture experiments to investigate the direction and magnitude of soil available P and the responses of its influencing factors to repeated DRW cycles and their frequency and intensity under three typical land-use types (cropland, grassland, and shrubland) in Gansu Province, North-western China. The results showed that the available P concentration of cropland, grassland, and shrubland soils after repeated DRW cycles significantly decreased by 8.9%, 11.5%, and 14.2%, respectively, compared with a constant humidity control. With increasing intensity of the DRW cycles, the available P concentration of grassland and shrubland soils significantly increased by 14.3% and 15.5%, respectively, while in cropland soil P significantly decreased by 10.4%. Compared with low-frequency DRW cycles, high-frequency DRW cycles significantly reduced the available P concentration by 6.4% in grassland soil and increased it by 9.8% in shrubland soil but had no significant effect in cropland soil. Overall, the responses of soil P availability to repeated DRW cycles vary among different land-use types, and the magnitude of the soil P availability response to repeated DRW cycles depended strongly on soil microorganism biomass, phosphatase activity, and the initial soil properties, being more pronounced in grassland and shrubland soils than in cropland soils. It is therefore essential to consider land-use type when studying the effects of DRW on soil P cycling in semi-arid regions, especially in the context of climate change.",

Methodologically, we formalize a two-market setting (final food products and agricultural raw materials) and derive comparative-statics implications for microeconomic profitability indicators that guide agents’ choices. The main propositions are as follows. First, the integration of the sourcing base for processors is likely to increase the relative profitability of processing by improving the ratio of output to raw-material inputs and, crucially, by widening the price wedge between final food prices and agricultural input prices. Second, the same mechanism implies that agricultural producers in the EU face greater downside risk, as increased competition on the raw-material market tends to depress farm-gate prices; the resulting revenue effect is unlikely to be fully offset by higher sales volumes in the short run. Third, these asymmetric effects rationalize the divergence of perceived risks and benefits across processors and farmers, even when both operate within the same integrated market environment. In addition, we highlight a complementary risk channel: market integration can affect not only price levels but also price volatility in raw-material markets, which may further increase downside risk for farms. The proposed framework provides a disciplined basis for scenario and simulation analyses relevant to agricultural and trade policy, and yields testable predictions for future ex-post evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "In agricultural plant protection spraying, dynamic occlusion by droplet swarms on leaf surfaces poses a major challenge to accurately acquiring leaf motion parameters, limiting the optimization of precision spraying and pesticide utilization. Traditional contact-based methods interfere with natural leaf dynamics, while non-contact optical approaches suffer from tracking failures under occlusion. This study proposes an improved framework combining YOLOv8 integrated with a Spatial Attention Module (SAM) and optimized DeepSORT for robust non-contact tracking of marked points on pepper leaves. High-speed binocular cameras were used to collect leaf motion data under controlled droplet occlusion conditions. Results demonstrate that, under 5% occlusion, the improved model achieves a 19.6% increase in detection mAP@0.5 and significantly enhances tracking MOTA, with trajectory breakage rate reduced to 3.2% and ID switches decreased by approximately 71.4% in long-sequence tracking. Quantitative analysis of leaf midrib motion reveals a clear spatial gradient: average speed increases from 0.012 m s−1 at the base to 0.153 m s−1 at the tip, with intensified fluctuations toward the tip and a consistent dominant vibration frequency of 0.403 Hz across all points. This method provides an efficient, reliable non-contact solution for measuring leaf motion parameters in complex spraying scenarios, offering valuable data support for targeted spray parameter optimization and improved deposition efficiency in precision agriculture.",

    "Abstract": "To mitigate the exhausting of phosphate rock (PR) reserves and the widespread water eutrophication due partially to excessive phosphorus (P), efficient adsorbents are valuable. Calcium (Ca) and aluminum (Al) containing layered double hydroxides (CaAl-LDHs) showed high P adsorption capacity and potential as slow-release P fertilizers, which merits further investigation. Two P proportions (5% and 10%) of P-adsorbed CaAl-LDHs (P-LDHs) were prepared, and its effects on various soil P contents and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) growth were evaluated. The main components of 5%P-LDH were P-intercalated CaAl-LDH and brushite, while 10%P-LDH mainly consisted of brushite. The proportions of P were extracted from 10%P-LDH and increased in the order of 4.9% (deionized water) &lt; 48.9% (Olsen method) &lt; 63.5% (Bray method) &lt; 67.4% (citric acid), which suggested that 10%P-LDH could be citrate-soluble P fertilizer. 10%P-LDH showed similar effects on soil available P with single superphosphate (SSP). Both 5%- and 10%P-LDHs showed comparable improvement with SSP on aboveground dry weight of oilseed in the red soil, while being inapparent in the Fluvo-aquic soil. The CaAl-LDH appeared capable of providing Ca for rape growth in the low initial P concentration red soil, which showed the highest dry weight when combined with SSP. The recycled P-LDHs, especially 10%P-LDH, could supply P in a comparable manner with SSP for oilseed rape P uptake. Based on trials conducted under controlled conditions, our study suggested a promising production route of commercial P fertilizer alternatives via water P removal by CaAl-LDH. Further validations with realistic wastewater P removal by CaAl-LDH and via field scale growth trials are still needed before wide application of the alternative P fertilizer production procedure reported in the present study.",

    "Abstract": "Phosphorus is a fundamental macronutrient, yet its low bioavailability in most soils makes phosphorus deficiency one of the most persistent constraints limiting global crop productivity. Although mineral fertilisation has long been the primary strategy for maintaining adequate P supply, inefficient fertiliser use and strong soil phosphorus fixation result in substantial losses. As a result, current research is shifting toward integrated phosphorus management approaches that combine optimised fertilisation techniques, unconventional phosphorus sources, and biological tools that mobilise soil-bound phosphorus. At the same time, silicon has emerged as a promising modulator of plant stress resilience, which can also influence phosphorus homeostasis. Silicon enhances plant physiological robustness by strengthening tissues, improving photosynthetic performance, and activating antioxidant pathways. Silicon may also modify phosphorus mobility in soils, promoting more efficient uptake and utilisation in plant tissues. This review synthesises current knowledge on physiological and molecular plant responses to phosphorus deficiency. It compares modern fertilisation strategies, ranging from precision fertilisation to unconventional phosphorus fertilisers. Particular attention is devoted to the emerging role of silicon in improving phosphorus availability and in enhancing crop plant phosphorus-use efficiency. The review concludes with future research directions that may help integrate silicon-based interventions into sustainable nutrient-management systems.",

    "Abstract": "Apples are cultivated over a large global area with high yields, and efficient robotic harvesting requires accurate detection and localization, particularly in complex orchard environments where occlusion by leaves and fruits poses substantial challenges. To address this, we proposed a YOLO-CSB model-based method for apple detection and localization, designed to overcome occlusion and enhance the efficiency and accuracy of mechanized harvesting. Firstly, a comprehensive apple dataset was constructed, encompassing various lighting conditions and leaf obstructions, to train the model. Subsequently, the YOLO-CSB model, built upon YOLO11s, was developed with improvements including the integration of a lightweight CSFC Block to reconstruct the backbone, making the model more lightweight; the SEAM component is introduced to improve feature restoration in areas with occlusions, complemented by the efficient BiFPN approach to boost detection precision. Additionally, a 3D positioning technique integrating YOLO-CSB with an RGB-D camera is presented. Validation was conducted via ablation analyses, comparative tests, and 3D localization accuracy assessments in controlled laboratory and structured orchard settings, The YOLO-CSB model demonstrated effectiveness in apple target recognition and localization, with notable advantages under leaf and fruit occlusion conditions. Compared to the baseline YOLO11s model, YOLO-CSB improved mAP by 3.02% and reduced the parameter count by 3.19%. Against mainstream object detection models, YOLO-CSB exhibited significant advantages in detection accuracy and model size, achieving a mAP of 93.69%, precision of 88.82%, recall of 87.58%, and a parameter count of only 9.11 M. The detection accuracy in laboratory settings reached 100%, with average localization errors of 4.15 mm, 3.96 mm, and 4.02 mm in the X, Y, and Z directions, respectively. This method effectively addresses complex occlusion environments, enabling efficient detection and precise localization of apples, providing reliable technical support for mechanized harvesting.",

    "Abstract": "The study investigated whether the full replacement of chemically solvent-extracted soybean meal (SM) with mechanically extracted soybean press cake (SC) could be carried out in pigs intended for dry-cured ham production. Eighty Italian heavy pigs were fattened and finished up to a body weight of 165 kg, with half being fed a commercial diet containing SM and the other half fed an isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diet in which SC fully replaced SM. Growth parameters, carcass traits, fresh meat and cured ham quality, and fatty acid composition were analyzed. Thighs were processed according to the Parma ham production rules, which require a long curing period. The only noteworthy differences observed concerned an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acid levels in the subcutaneous fat of the SC group compared with the SM group (17.26 vs. 14.58%, p &lt; 0.05, in fresh thighs and 15.83 vs. 12.14%, p &lt; 0.01, in cured hams), and particularly in linoleic acid (14.85 vs. 13.01%, p &lt; 0.01 in fresh thighs and 13.72 vs. 10.64%, p &lt; 0.01 in cured hams), which is consistent with general nutritional recommendations favoring unsaturated over saturated fatty acids. These modifications did not affect the final quality, oxidative stability, or visual appearance of the long-cured hams. In conclusion, soybean cake–based diets can be applied throughout the production cycle of heavy pigs; however, higher inclusion levels should be carefully managed, as they may affect parameters related to suitability for dry curing.",

    "Abstract": "Hemotropic mycoplasmosis is an emerging vector-borne infection in goats caused by hemotropic mycoplasmas, which leads to anemia, poor growth, abortion, and reduced productivity. In Northeastern Thailand, smallholder meat goat systems expose animals to blood-feeding vectors and gastrointestinal parasites; however, epidemiological data on these issues are limited. This study examined the prevalence of hemotropic mycoplasmosis, its co-infection with gastrointestinal parasites, and the associated risk factors in anemic goats. PCR and sequence analyses confirmed the presence of Mycoplasma ovis, Candidatus Mycoplasma haematobovis and Candidatus Mycoplasma haematovis, with herd-level and individual-level prevalences of all hemotropic mycoplasmas (HMs) at 93.3% (14/15; 95%CI: 68.1–99.8%) and 59.8% (52/87; 95%CI: 48.7–70.1%), respectively. Ca. M. haematobovis was identified as the predominant species. Multivariable analysis indicated that age ≥ 1 year is a significant risk factor for HM infection (adjusted OR: 9.88; 95% CI: 1.73–56.48; p = 0.01). Co-infection between HM and gastrointestinal nematodes was found to be associated with age (p &lt; 0.05). Effective management requires targeted selective treatment, post-treatment monitoring of infection status, vector control, and farmer education on zoonotic risks. These findings provide critical insights for designing evidence-based surveillance, control, and prevention strategies to improve goat health and productivity in smallholder tropical systems.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: As part of the European Union’s harmonized monitoring framework, Belgium conducts antimicrobial resistance (AMR) monitoring in commensal bacteria from livestock. The aim of this study was to conduct a cost analysis of the national AMR monitoring in livestock, and to explore sampling size scenarios in relation to their associated costs and statistical performance (power and confidence) of monitoring. Methods: To our knowledge, this is the first published cost evaluation using unit cost aggregation of a national AMR monitoring program in animals. Results: The testing of the different sample size scenarios showed that if the sample size increases, the costs increase linearly. A sample size increase of 10 samples/isolates (e.g., from 170 to 180) can increase the yearly total costs per animal species by 5.2%. Moreover, the testing of the different scenarios showed that if the sample size increases, the power and the confidence level also increase, providing a higher level of trust in the results of the monitoring program. The highest total monitoring costs per animal category were estimated for fattening pigs, broilers and veal calves (over 18% of total costs each, using 2024 data). Among the various monitoring activities, antimicrobial susceptibility testing emerged as the costliest component, representing 50.2% of the total monitoring costs. Conclusions: The approach presented allows it to be used by other countries aiming to estimate the cost of their national AMR monitoring in animals or other similar activities. This economic and scenario testing analysis can be used to suggest informed suggestions to improve AMR monitoring in animals.",

    "Abstract": "This study used a Systemic Modeling technique, based on the methodologies of Churchman and Ackoff, to integrate and assess the subsystems regulating the functionality of a Rocket Candy (R-Candy) motor. The nozzle and combustion chamber design was improved using a five-phase systemic architecture to assure the coherent interplay of essential factors, including pressure, temperature, and velocity fields. The principles of experimental rocketry are elucidated through the examination of impulse performance throughout class A to class C engines. A preliminary design was developed in SolidWorks 2024, incorporating the engine’s three main components: the igniter, the combustion chamber, and a convergent–divergent nozzle that enhances the acceleration of the exhaust gases. The system model was validated using simulations in FEATool and verified through experimentation. This allowed for the analysis of fluid behavior, as well as the geometry of the structures, initial parameters, and boundary conditions. The results demonstrate a strong correlation between the simulations and the experimental data, with discrepancies of less than 1.5%, confirming the reliability and feasibility of the nozzle design. The findings indicate that systemic modeling, in conjunction with CFD and experimentation, can provide a strategic framework for iterative refinement, optimization of key performance metrics, and the development of cost-effective, high-performance R-Candy engines for educational and experimental purposes.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a geometric difficulty analysis framework for Formula 1 racing lines based on telemetry data from the 2024 season. To ensure geometric consistency across multiple laps, a representative racing line is identified using the discrete Fréchet distance, and corner segments are modeled using biarc approximation to estimate stable curvature. Based on the resulting geometric representation, we introduce three curvature-based difficulty metrics—the Curvature Exposure Index (CEI), Maximum Curvature Severity (MCS), and Curvature Variation Index (CVI)—to quantify both local and global track characteristics. This approach establishes a strictly geometric definition of difficulty based on the planar projection of the trajectory, purposely decoupling structural complexity from 3D terrain features, vehicle dynamics, and race context. Experimental results across 24 tracks demonstrate that these metrics effectively capture distinct track characteristics: CEI ranged from 1.97 rad/km (Italian) to 8.44 rad/km (Monaco), MCS from 230.54 km−1 (Spanish) to 1689.54 km−1 (Monaco), and CVI from 7.60 (British) to 9.33 (Monaco and Qatar). Although this framework focuses on planar geometry, it provides a compact, extensible foundation for geometric analysis and future applications incorporating elevation profiles and dynamic variables.",

    "Abstract": "Standard materials for middle clavicle implants are limited to Titanium and Stainless Steel; their high Young’s Modulus promotes stress shielding, which causes complications such as malunion or implant failure. This study investigates alternative materials, Cobalt Chromium, Polyether ether ketone (PEEK), Magnesium, and Polylactic Acid (PLA), along with the standard materials, to understand their stress distributions, assess the likelihood of stress shielding, and evaluate their viability through the use of ANSYS 2025 R1 Finite Element Analysis (FEA). The materials are tested with four plate variations: Superior Plate, Anteroinferior Plate, Thin Dual Plate, and Thick Dual Plate, subjected to a simultaneous load of 100 N compressive, 100 N bending, and 1 Nm torsional, and were compared according to their maximum von Mises Stresses in plate, bone, and fracture line. High Young’s Modulus materials (Titanium, Stainless Steel, and Cobalt Chromium) had maximum von Mises plate stresses ranging from 200 to 265 MPa. In contrast, lower Young’s Modulus materials (Magnesium, PEEK, and PLA) showed maximum von Mises stresses of only around 115 to 170 MPa. PLA showed insufficient material strength, with bone stresses being around 30 MPa greater than plate stresses. PEEK showed viability but failed in material strength for the superior plate variation, as its maximum von Mises Stress of 168.13 MPa exceeded the yield strength of 125 MPa. Magnesium showed the best results, with bone and plate stresses near each other, and passed all viability criteria, demonstrating good material strength and a low risk of stress shielding. The results reinforce the use of Titanium and Stainless Steel as standards, show the viability of Cobalt Chromium for patients needing increased stability but with risks of stress shielding, demonstrate Magnesium for bioabsorbability and low stress shielding risk, suggest PEEK for low load applications, and reveal that PLA has insufficient strength. The study provides a comprehensive comparison of different materials with various variations, which provides a foundation for future studies to analyze material behavior.",

The second phase of the project consisted of installing the water supply system, which comprises 479 well pumps, united to deliver around 2 million cubic meters of water to the north. Historical performance data for the water supply system were analyzed, and a model for the system’s reliability calculation was developed: a finite-source, multi-server queuing system with spares (M/M/c//N/Y). The model enabled the analytical calculation of the system’s reliability in different configurations. Each configuration was assessed using a unique risk score, defined as the product of reliability-based parameters and the consequences associated with water-shortage events resulting from system failures. The analysis identified two alternative configurations that satisfy all predefined performance and risk criteria. Both configurations require fewer resources than the original system design, with up to seven fewer spare pumps, allowing for decision-makers to select the most appropriate option based on additional operational and contextual considerations.",

    "Abstract": "Advancements in concentrating solar power (CSP) plants are essential for the wider adoption of these technologies. Increasing the operating temperature of the plants is one of the most promising ways to achieve further cost reductions and performance improvements. In this context, progress in supporting components—such as molten salt tanks—is critical to enable these advancements. This study compares a novel molten salt tank based on a refractory concrete formulation with a conventional design made from 347H stainless steel over the period 2015–2025. The prices of refractory concrete and stainless steel were analyzed across the decade to estimate the costs of the corresponding TES tanks in 2015 and 2025. The results showed that, while the concrete-based tank was more expensive than the conventional tank in 2015, the situation reversed by 2025, with the conventional stainless steel solution becoming 11% more expensive than the refractory concrete alternative. Additionally, an analysis of the producer price indexes for both materials highlighted that concrete exhibited a more stable price trend compared to stainless steel, which was subject to greater intra- and inter-year fluctuations. Finally, a brief examination of the 347H stainless steel production chain identified key causes of price volatility, such as the high geographic concentration of its main raw material extraction sites worldwide.",

    "Abstract": "Underground structures are essential components of modern transportation and infrastructure systems, and evaluating their behavior under extreme dynamic loads such as explosions is critical for urban safety. This study examines the dynamic effects of underground explosions on tunnel–soil–free-field interaction using numerical methods. Finite element-based dynamic analyses are carried out using PLAXIS-2D, in which a single-layer NATM (New Austrian Tunneling Method) tunnel section representing the Eurasia Tunnel is modeled. Blast loads are defined based on closed-space explosion conditions specified in UFC 3-340-02, and force–time histories are generated for different explosion intensities. A parametric study is performed by varying soil type (soft and stiff soil) and tunnel cover depth to investigate wave propagation mechanisms. Response spectra derived from free-field surface acceleration records are compared with the design spectra of the Turkish Building Earthquake Code (TBEC-2018). The results show that increasing explosion intensity significantly amplifies spectral accelerations. Soft soils exhibit longer acceleration wavelengths, whereas stiffer soils result in higher acceleration amplitudes. Shallow explosion depths are found to reduce soil stability and considerably increase surface accelerations. Under unfavorable soil and cover conditions, explosion-induced demands may approach or exceed design-level earthquake spectra.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate extraction of building vector contours from high-resolution remote sensing images is a fundamental task for urban mapping and geographic information systems. However, existing approaches often suffer from blurred boundaries and geometric distortions when dealing with buildings of complex shapes, limiting the accuracy and usability of the extracted building footprints. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-level building contour refinement framework based on morphological perception. The proposed framework integrates a three-stage contour optimization strategy, including principal direction extraction, morphology-based contour reconstruction, and geometry-aware regularization, to progressively refine complex building contours under geometric constraints. In addition, a multi-dimensional contour complexity model and an adaptive threshold optimization network are introduced to dynamically adjust refinement parameters according to contour complexity. Experimental results on the WHU-Mix dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 87.52%, 77.43%, and 87.35% in boundary F1, vertex F1, and mIoU, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed framework provides an effective and robust solution for high-precision building vector contour extraction in complex remote sensing scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Compared with conventional monostatic radar systems, space-air bistatic frequency diverse array (FDA) radar exhibits superior anti-jamming capability and enhanced early-warning performance for weak and maneuvering targets. However, the complex bistatic configuration and the high velocity of spaceborne platforms introduce several challenges, including range migration (RM), Doppler spread (DS), and Doppler frequency migration (DFM). In particular, frequency offsets among FDA array elements exacerbate inter-channel Doppler mismatches, significantly reducing the coherent integration gain and consequently degrading detection performance. To address these issues, this article establishes a target echo model within a three-dimensional coordinate framework and provides an analysis of the different order terms. Subsequently, the SOKT is implemented to eliminate first- and second-order range migrations as well as the coupling induced by velocity ambiguity. Thereafter, the MDF is employed in the slow-time domain to compress Doppler spread and restore coherent gain. Simulation results verify that the SOKT-MDF approach effectively mitigates the effects of target velocity and acceleration, alleviates the Doppler spread (DS) problem, and significantly improves detection performance while maintaining low computational complexity.",

    "Abstract": "The interdisciplinary nature of artificial intelligence courses forces non-computer science majors to contend with the simultaneous challenges of terminology comprehension and language cognition. To increase the efficiency of terminology teaching, this project develops and deploys an OpenAI-based AI chatbot teaching system that incorporates the concept of content and language integrated learning (CLIL). The system creates a dual-track “terminology layer-cognition layer” framework that includes term recognition, multi-level explanation (contextual examples and conceptual associations), task-driven dialogues, and conversation memory bank (CMB) modules. It then guides students through natural language interactions to master the core AI terms in context. The system’s effectiveness was confirmed in a controlled experiment with 98 participants (including computer and non-computer majors) separated into two groups: experimental (chatbot teaching) and control (conventional PPT teaching). In terms of terminology mastery, the experimental group’s posttest score (86.0 ± 5.33) was considerably higher than that of the control group (66.98 ± 5.6). Non-computer science major students showed a more significant improvement effect (83.29 ± 4.5 vs. 63.62 ± 4.68 for the control group). Non-computing students evaluated the clarity of systematic terminology explanation (4.33 ± 0.76) and the effectiveness of contextual assistance (4.21 ± 0.88) as the most important aspects of their learning experience. These experimental results show that the fusion AI chatbot teaching system developed in this study can improve teaching efficiency while effectively reducing cognitive load, and that the task-guided and immediate feedback mechanism can significantly increase students’ learning engagement.",

    "Abstract": "Tenacibaculosis is a major bacterial disease in aquaculture, with Tenacibaculum discolor being characterized as one of the causative agents. This study evaluated the antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential of three isolated Pseudoalteromonas strains—Pseudoalteromonas sp. GY795-2 (deep-sea), Pseudoalteromonas spongiae MB2 (aquaculture installation), and Pseudoalteromonas tetraodonis SAE 20 (kelps)—against T. discolor strain FMCC B487. Cell-free supernatants (SNs) from each Pseudoalteromonas culture were tested in microtiter assays, assessing planktonic growth measured by OD600 and biofilm biomass quantified by crystal violet (CV) staining. The addition of the Pseudoalteromonas SNs affected both growth and biofilm development of T. discolor strain FMCC B487. A significant decrease in T. discolor strain FMCC B487 growth and biofilm was observed in the presence of P. spongiae MB2 SN, whereas the SN of Pseudoalteromonas sp. GY795-2 promoted both growth and biofilm development of T. discolor strain FMCC B487. To assess whole-cell activity, dual-species biofilms were formed on plastic surfaces. After 24 h, all three Pseudoalteromonas strains reduced the viable T. discolor strain FMCC B487 population while maintaining their own cell numbers comparable to single-culture controls, suggesting an inhibitory interaction. These results demonstrate that these Pseudoalteromonas strains’ metabolites and cells can modulate T. discolor growth and biofilm development, highlighting their potential as biocontrol agents in aquaculture.",

    "Abstract": "Human–robot collaboration (HRC) offers a significant potential to improve productivity, safety, and performance in construction, yet its adoption remains constrained by interrelated barriers. The existing studies largely identify these barriers in isolation, with limited insight into their systemic interactions. This study addresses this gap by synthesising prior research using PRISMA and applying interpretive structural modelling (ISM) to examine the hierarchical and causal relationships among barriers to HRC in construction. Eight barrier categories are identified: financial, safety, communication, robot technology-related, organisational, legal/regulatory, education/training, and social and human factors. The ISM–MICMAC results reveal regulatory and communication barriers as key upstream drivers shaping downstream safety, training, organisational, and technological outcomes. By moving beyond descriptive listings, the study provides a systems-level framework that supports the strategic prioritisation of interventions and informed decision-making. The findings advance the theoretical understanding of HRC as a socio-technical system and offer an evidence-informed foundation for context-sensitive implementation strategies in construction.",

    "Abstract": "This paper proposes a novel method for transferable adversarial attacks from Image Quality Assessment (IQA) to Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models. Attacking modern VQA models is challenging due to their high complexity and the temporal nature of video content. Since IQA and VQA models share similar low- and mid-level feature representations, and IQA models are substantially cheaper and faster to run, we leverage them as surrogates to generate transferable adversarial perturbations. Our method, MaxT-I2VQA jointly Maximizes IQA scores and Targets IQA feature activations to improve transferability from IQA to VQA models. We first analyze the correlation between IQA and VQA internal features and use these insights to design a feature-targeting loss. We evaluate MaxT-I2VQA by transferring attacks from four state-of-the-art IQA models to four recent VQA models and compare against three competitive baselines. Compared to prior methods, MaxT-I2VQA increases the transferability of an attack success rate by 7.9% and reduces per-example attack runtime by 8 times. Our experiments confirm that IQA and VQA feature spaces are sufficiently aligned to enable effective cross-task transfer.",

    "Abstract": "Ohmic heating pasteurization (OHP) is a volumetric thermal processing technology that enables rapid and uniform heat generation within liquid foods. This study aimed to optimize the OHP conditions for passion fruit juice processing by maximizing thermal efficiency and preserving quality attributes. A Box–Behnken design combined with response surface methodology was applied to evaluate the effects of pasteurization temperature (75–95 °C), holding time (15–45 s), and voltage gradient (10–30 V/cm) on the system performance coefficient (SPC), total color difference (ΔE), and vitamin C retention. Multi-response optimization was conducted to simultaneously enhance SPC and vitamin C content while minimizing color change. The optimal OHP conditions were identified as a temperature of 82.5 °C, a holding time of 25 s, and a voltage gradient of 18.5 V/cm. Under these conditions, the processed juice exhibited a high SPC value (0.80 ± 0.05), moderate vitamin C retention (20.07 ± 3.18 mg/100 mL), and low total color difference (ΔE = 7.64 ± 1.08). Enzymatic assays further demonstrated substantial inactivation of quality-related enzymes, with residual activities of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase reduced to 8.07 ± 1.74% and 12.6 ± 2.1%, respectively, compared with untreated juice. These results indicate that optimized ohmic heating pasteurization can achieve efficient thermal processing while maintaining the physicochemical and nutritional quality of high-acid fruit juices.",

    "Abstract": "The current study investigated proximal femur bone shape asymmetry and its associations with cartilage composition and functional performance in individuals with hip osteoarthritis (OA). Forty-seven participants with hip OA (mean age: 53.77 ± 12.47 years; 22 females; BMI: 24.49 ± 4.0 kg/m2) were included in this study. Bilateral hip MRI was performed using a 3.0 T MR scanner with 3D proton density fat-saturated CUBE and MAPSS sequences. Automatic segmentation of the proximal femur was achieved using a U-Net framework refined through a human-in-the-loop annotation strategy, followed by three-dimensional bone shape analysis to quantify asymmetry. Cartilage relaxation times were assessed using atlas-based segmentation and quantification, while functional activity was evaluated according to OARSI-recommended criteria. The proposed proximal femur bone segmentation showed a DSC of 96.48% (95%-CI: 96.33–96.64) and Hausdorff Distance of 4.66 mm (95%-CI: 3.80–5.51). Increased bone shape asymmetry in the posterior–lateral–superior region of the proximal femur was associated with functional activity in the chair stand test (rho = −0.41; p = 0.006), and the anterior–lateral–inferior region demonstrated a comparatively higher significant positive correlation (rho = 0.37; p = 0.006) with the T1rho values of the acetabular cartilage region. Overall, the findings indicate that region-specific proximal femoral bone shape asymmetry in hip OA is associated with cartilage characteristics and functional impairment, highlighting the potential value of bone shape features as imaging biomarkers relevant to clinical function.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic liver injury is accompanied by coordinated disturbances in lipid trafficking and inflammatory–fibrogenic signaling. Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-β1) signaling has been implicated in hepatic fibrogenesis and tumor-associated remodeling and may co-vary with disturbances in lipid trafficking. Lisosan G (LG), a fermented wheat-derived nutraceutical, has reported antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity and may influence these interconnected pathways. This study evaluated whether dietary LG alters the lipid composition of plasma lipoprotein fractions and hepatic TGF-β1 levels across distinct liver contexts. Seventy-two female Wistar rats were randomized into nine groups (n = 8/group) defined by liver condition, consisting of healthy control (Control), non-neoplastic liver (PH), and neoplastic liver injury (HCC; PH followed by diethylnitrosamine, DEN), and diet (standard diet, SD + 2.5% LG, or SD + 5% LG). Plasma lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, HDL1, HDL2) were isolated by stepwise KBr density-gradient ultracentrifugation, and cholesterol (TC), phospholipids (PL), and triacylglycerols (TG) were quantified in each fraction. Hepatic TGF-β1 was measured by ELISA and normalized to total protein. LG effects depended strongly on baseline liver status, with significant Condition × Diet interactions for most lipid endpoints and for hepatic TGF-β1. In healthy rats, LG produced fraction-selective remodeling rather than uniform lipid lowering, including increased VLDL-TG at both doses and non-linear changes in cholesterol distribution across LDL and HDL subfractions. After PH, LG broadened lipid remodeling, including reduced VLDL-PL, increased VLDL-TG (both doses), and an increase in LDL-TC at 5% LG, accompanied by marked changes in HDL1/HDL2 cholesterol partitioning. In HCC, LG induced pronounced, often dose-dependent increases in LDL-associated lipids (LDL-PL, LDL-TG, LDL-TC) and increased HDL1-TC while decreasing HDL2-TC. Hepatic TGF-β1 was elevated in PH and further increased in HCC versus controls; LG reduced hepatic TGF-β1 in a condition-dependent manner, with the strongest reduction at 5% LG in HCC. Dietary Lisosan G remodels circulating lipoprotein lipid composition in a liver-status-dependent manner and is associated with reduced hepatic TGF-β1 abundance in injured liver, most prominently in neoplastic injury. These findings are consistent with the notion that nutraceutical interventions may show stronger phenotypic effects under perturbed metabolic–fibrogenic states than under stable physiology, while highlighting the need for mechanistic work to distinguish altered lipoprotein secretion from changes in peripheral clearance and to assess pathway-level TGF-β signaling.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic pain is a highly prevalent and disabling condition with a well-documented female predominance in incidence, severity and persistence. These sex differences are driven by sexually dimorphic neuroimmune mechanisms rather than psychosocial factors alone. This systematic review was conducted to comprehensively synthesize human clinical and translational evidence on sex-specific neuroimmune and glial cell pathways underlying chronic pain. Scientific literature was systematically searched from database inception to December 2025 across multiple biomedical databases to identify relevant clinical and translational studies. Across pain conditions, convergent evidence demonstrated that chronic pain mechanisms diverge by sex at cellular and molecular levels. Male-predominant pathways were characterized by microglial activation, particularly P2X4 receptor–mediated signaling and brain-derived neurotrophic factor–dependent neuronal disinhibition, supported by neuroimaging, transcriptomic, and pharmacological data. In contrast, female-predominant mechanisms involved adaptive immune processes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration, pannexin-1–dependent leptin release, chemokine signaling, and astrocyte-mediated neuroimmune crosstalk. Sex-specific cytokine and chemokine profiles, differential glial activation patterns, and divergent neuroimmune–endocrine interactions further distinguished pain pathways between males and females. Despite consistent mechanistic trends, substantial heterogeneity within each sex, limited sex-stratified power in many studies, and variability in outcome measures constrained quantitative synthesis and generalizability. The findings indicate that chronic pain is not a unitary disorder but rather a collection of mechanistically distinct conditions shaped by biological sex. These results highlight the limitations of sex-neutral therapeutic strategies and support the development of precision medicine approaches incorporating sex-informed neuroimmune biomarkers and mechanism-matched interventions. Future studies should prioritize adequately powered sex-stratified analyses, integration of neuroimmune biomarkers and clinical trial designs capable of detecting sex-by-treatment interactions.",

    "Abstract": "Cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) functions as a DNA sensor in the cytoplasm, triggering immune responses, but it is also translocated to the nucleus, where it is kept catalytically inactive. It consists of an unstructured N-terminal domain of around 160 amino acids, and a larger C-terminal fold comprising the catalytic and DNA-binding domains. Subcellular localization of cGAS is thought to play a key role in its regulation. Here, we make use of heterologous expression in the eukaryotic model Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study cGAS localization in a neutral cellular environment. cGAS-eGFP was mostly found in aggregates at the endoplasmic reticulum–mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) and juxtanuclear protein quality compartments (JUNQs), although some cells displayed an association between cGAS-eGFP and the plasma membrane. The N-terminus of cGAS fused to eGFP was unable to associate with the plasma membrane by itself, but its deletion dramatically promoted nuclear localization of cGAS-eGFP and decreased cytoplasmic aggregates. A mutant in the DNA-binding Zn-thumb motif of cGAS also showed a more prominent nuclear localization. Thus, both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of cGAS seem to cooperate to prevent nuclear localization and to maintain cytoplasmic reservoirs of the protein. Heterologous cGAS expression in yeast is a valuable tool for modeling aspects of its subcellular localization and aggregative features.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as an important contributor to Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet perioperative immune responses in this population remain incompletely characterized. This study investigated perioperative cytokine dynamics in patients with PD compared with healthy controls (HCs) undergoing orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia. Methods: In this prospective pilot observational study, 50 patients scheduled for lower limb orthopedic surgery were enrolled (25 PD patients, 25 HCs). Serum cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, VEGF, MCP-1, HMGB1, S100B, and PARK7) were measured immediately after anesthesia induction (PRE) and 24 h postoperatively (POST). Between-group comparisons were performed using independent t-tests, and within-group perioperative changes were assessed using paired t-tests. Absolute (Δ = POST − PRE) and relative perioperative changes were analyzed. Results: IL-6 increased significantly after surgery in both groups, with no significant differences in absolute or relative perioperative changes between the PD and HC group. IL-8 concentrations were numerically higher in PD patients at both time points, but perioperative changes did not differ significantly between groups. VEGF decreased modestly within the PD group, whereas no significant change was observed in HCs; however, between-group differences in perioperative VEGF changes were not significant. S100B and PARK7 increased postoperatively in HCs but not in PD patients, while MCP-1 and HMGB1 showed no significant perioperative changes. Conclusions: In this pilot study, perioperative cytokine responses in patients with PD were largely comparable to those in HCs. Despite evidence of chronic low-grade inflammation in the PD group, no disease-specific amplification of acute perioperative inflammatory responses was observed. These findings suggest that perioperative immune activation in PD may be selective rather than global.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral eplerenone in patients with acute and chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR). Methods: In this prospective study, 43 patients with CSCR and subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT) at baseline were divided either to oral eplerenone (n = 23) or observation (n = 20). All subjects underwent best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) measurement, OCT, and fluorescein angiography (FA) at baseline. The changes in BCVA and subretinal resolution (SRF) were examined at 1, 6, and 12 months after the initiation of treatment. Potential adverse events were recorded. Results: At month 6, SRF resolution was observed in 78.3% and 45% of the patients in the eplerenone and control groups, respectively (p = 0.024). However, there was a recurrence of fluid in three patients in the eplerenone group and in four patients in the control group. Therefore, at month 12, 65.2% of the patients in the eplerenone group and 25% in the control group had SRF resolution (p = 0.008). There was a statistically significant improvement in BCVA at 6 months (p &lt; 0.001) and 12 months (p &lt; 0.001) in the eplerenone group, while in the control group, there was an improvement in BCVA at 6 months (p = 0.079) and 12 months (p = 0.259), which did not reach statistical significance. Regarding adverse events, no ocular nor systemic adverse events were reported during the follow-up period, apart from dry mouth in 7 out of 23 patients (30.4%) taking eplerenone. Conclusions: Oral eplerenone was found to be a safe and effective treatment alternative for the management of CSCR in both acute and chronic cases, providing SRF resolution in approximately 65% of patients with significant improvement in visual acuity at the 12th month of follow-up.",

    "Abstract": "Inflammatory and immune-mediated skin diseases are increasingly recognized as disorders in which genetic susceptibility is shaped and sustained by environmentally responsive regulatory programs. Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis (AD), vitiligo, systemic sclerosis (SSc), lupus erythematosus (LE), and lichen planus (LP) are clinically distinct, yet they share chronic or relapsing inflammation, tissue remodeling, and limited durability of many current therapies. Because genetic variation alone cannot fully explain disease onset, flare dynamics, heterogeneity in severity, or lesion recurrence, epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as a plausible link between environmental exposures and stable disease phenotypes in skin. Epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA networks, controls cell-type-specific transcription without altering the DNA sequence and may contribute to persistent inflammatory states and disease memory despite clinical improvement. The current review synthesizes primary preclinical and translational evidence on epigenetic-targeted therapeutic strategies across these conditions, focusing on interventions that modulate DNA methylation, histone acetylation and deacetylation, histone methylation, chromatin-associated regulatory proteins, and RNA-based approaches. We compare the maturity of therapeutic development across diseases, noting that research and intervention studies are concentrated in psoriasis and AD, whereas evidence for vitiligo, SSc, LE, and LP remains more limited and often derived from systemic or non-cutaneous models. Finally, we outline key gaps that currently restrict clinical translation and discuss why bridging them is essential for determining whether epigenetic modulation can move beyond proof-of-concept toward durable and clinically actionable interventions in inflammatory skin disease.",

    "Abstract": "Sulfamethazine (SMZ) is widely used in livestock production, and its residues can enter water and soil environments, posing potential risks to human health and ecosystems. This study focuses on environmental samples and constructs an AuNP-based colorimetric aptasensor using the SMZ1S aptamer for the rapid visual detection of SMZ. Under optimized conditions, the aptasensor showed a wide linear range from 0.05 to 0.4 µg/mL and a limit of detection of 0.039 µg/mL. Molecular dynamics simulations have demonstrated that the aptamer’s binding to SMZ is stable, providing a theoretical basis for the high selectivity of the aptasensor. Spike-and-recovery experiments yielded recoveries of 87.3–105.5%, 88.6–102.8%, and 87.5–103.4% for SMZ in lake water, tap water, and soil samples, respectively, with relative standard deviations of 5.9–8.3%, 8.0–10.6%, and 4.8–9.6%, showing good agreement with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) results (R2 ≥ 0.981). Overall, the proposed aptasensor provides a simple and effective approach for rapid detection of SMZ in environmental samples.",

    "Abstract": "Cavity limitations and interspecific competition render large macaws valuable models for elucidating the integration of parental care, pair-bond maintenance, and nest defense across reproductive stages. Through continuous video monitoring of a single artificial polyvinyl chloride nest box in the Tambopata National Reserve, Peru, we quantified the complete breeding cycle of a resident green-winged macaw (Ara chloropterus) pair and the visitation behavior of a sympatric scarlet macaw (Ara macao) pair within the same cavity. We constructed daily time budgets for 17 behaviors, categorized into seven functional groups, from motion-triggered video clips; employed multivariate tests; and generalized additive models with beta error distribution to describe the temporal changes across the five reproductive stages. The resident A. chloropterus exhibited a significant reorganization of parental investment, with early courtship behaviors transitioning to peak nest attendance and sentinel vigilance during incubation and early brooding. In later stages, locomotion increased significantly, associated with chick provisioning, whereas the frequency of allopreening remained relatively constant throughout the cycle. The visiting A. macao displayed a brief, behaviorally rich prospecting phase, characterized by nest inspection and locomotion, followed by a sharp decline in minimal activity. These divergent strategies align with owner–intruder asymmetries and floater dynamics, indicating that artificial cavities can support A. chloropterus breeding, while suggesting that additional cavities may redistribute breeding opportunities among competing macaws, a hypothesis necessitating multi-nest and multi-year evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "The endocannabinoid system is a ubiquitous neuromodulatory network that links internal physiological state to neural circuit function across the brain. While its roles in memory, reward, pain, and motor control are well established, its contribution to olfactory processing has only recently gained attention. This review synthesizes the current knowledge on the anatomical, cellular, and functional interactions between the endocannabinoid system and the olfactory pathway, from the olfactory epithelium and main olfactory bulb to higher order cortical targets. We highlight how endocannabinoid signaling, primarily via cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1), shapes synaptic transmission within olfactory bulb microcircuits, modulates centrifugal feedback, and adjusts sensory gain in a state-dependent manner, particularly in relation to hunger, feeding behavior, stress, and reward. In addition, we review evidence that the endocannabinoid system regulates olfactory neurodevelopment and adult neurogenesis by influencing neural stem cell proliferation, migration, and integration into existing circuits. Emerging links between endocannabinoid signaling, olfactory dysfunction, neuropsychiatric disease, metabolic disorders, and neurodegeneration underscore the translational relevance of this system. We also discuss methodological challenges inherent to studying endocannabinoid signaling and outline future directions, including circuit-specific targeting and intranasal delivery strategies. Together, these findings position the olfactory system as a powerful and accessible model for understanding how endocannabinoids couple internal state to perception and behavior, with important implications for therapeutic development.",

    "Abstract": "This dyadic study distinguishes parents’ general well-being (overall life satisfaction) from parental well-being (satisfaction specific to the parenting role) and examines how each relates to daily beneficial parenting behaviors in mother–father couples. Guided by the Parenting Pentagon Model (PPM), five behavioral constructs—Partnership, Leadership, Expressions of Love, Encouraging Independence, and Adherence to Rules—were assessed in 170 Israeli parents (85 mother–father dyads) of children aged 6 months to 9 years. Parents reported frequent beneficial parenting, with Expressions of Love the most prevalent and Encouraging Independence and Adherence to Rules the least frequent. Mothers reported significantly higher Expressions of Love than fathers (p &lt; 0.01), with no gender differences for the other PPM constructs. Across both parents, higher engagement in beneficial parenting behaviors was consistently associated with higher levels of both general and parental well-being (actor effects), with stronger associations for mothers than fathers. Partner effects showed a clear gender asymmetry: fathers’ parenting behaviors were positively associated with mothers’ general and parental well-being, whereas mothers’ behaviors were not consistently associated with fathers’ well-being. In addition, a larger number of children was negatively associated with mothers’ parental well-being. Overall, the findings highlight the relevance of daily parenting behaviors for parents’ own well-being and underscore the relational nature of parenting, with fathers’ behaviors playing a particularly salient role in mothers’ well-being within families of young children.",

    "Abstract": "This study merged archival data from three separate experiments to investigate the typology of individuals who benefit most and least from gratitude letter writing interventions (N = 487). First, k-means clustering of pre- to post-intervention changes in affect revealed three distinct groups: Buffered, Mixed Feelings, and Backfired. The Buffered cluster comprised individuals who, on average, experienced decreases in negative affect (e.g., less frustration) but no changes in positive emotions (e.g., joyful). The Mixed Feelings cluster experienced increases in positive affect, alongside self-conscious emotions, particularly indebtedness, which became more closely aligned with uplifting emotional states following the intervention. The Backfired cluster experienced decreases in positive feelings and increases in negative affect. Next, differences in individual characteristics across clusters indicated that those in the Buffered cluster were relatively more neurotic, had higher baseline negative feelings, and lower trait gratitude. Individuals in the Mixed Feelings cluster tended to be more dispositionally grateful and seemed to invest more effort into the activity. Finally, individuals in the Backfired cluster were also relatively more grateful and had higher baseline positive affect. These findings contribute to understanding individual differences in the effectiveness of gratitude letter interventions and highlight opportunities to tailor such activities to promote personal growth.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents an experimental study on the cyclic performance of large-scale composite plate shear walls–concrete encased (C-PSW/CE). Three C-PSW/CE specimens with concrete panels of different thicknesses were tested under cyclic loading. Their failure mode, lateral load–drift ratio relationship, strength and stiffness deterioration, and hysteretic energy dissipation were systematically analyzed. Initial concrete cracking occurred at a drift ratio of approximately 0.24%, while the three specimens reached their load-bearing capacities at a drift ratio of 1.34%. The results demonstrated that concrete panel thickness significantly influences the buckling behavior of the steel web plate. Thicker concrete panels provide enhanced out-of-plane restraint stiffness, delaying steel plate buckling and shifting the failure mode from overall to local buckling. Furthermore, an increased concrete thickness improves both the load-bearing and hysteretic energy dissipation capacities of the walls. These findings offer valuable insights for the design and application of C-PSW/CE in seismic-resistant structures.",

    "Abstract": "The mechanical behavior of sand–fines mixtures is governed by their limiting void ratios, which are sensitive to fines content and particle morphology. Conventional empirical correlations often fail to generalize to a wide range of soils, limiting their applicability in engineering design. This study develops an integrated approach combining laboratory calibration, discrete element method (DEM) simulations incorporating realistic particle morphologies and machine learning to predict maximum and minimum void ratios. Glass beads were first tested to validate DEM contact parameters, after which sand particles obtained through 3D scanning were employed to capture morphological effects. Correlation and partial least squares analyses confirmed fines content as the dominant factor, while particle shape also contributed to packing behavior. A fully connected neural network (FCNN) was trained to establish predictive relationships, demonstrating closer agreement with DEM simulations than traditional empirical formulations. The proposed approach provides a reliable and generalizable tool for evaluating packing characteristics and offers new insights into the role of particle morphology in the mechanical response of sand–fines mixtures.",

This study proposes the CorbuAI framework, hypothesizing that a multimodal AI system integrating Pix2pix-GAN and Stable Diffusion (SD) can streamline the transition from floor plan generation to elevation and interior design within a specific regional context. We developed a custom dataset featuring 2335 manually refined Chinese residential floor plans and 1570 elevation images. The methodology employs a specialized U-Net V2.0 generator for functional layout synthesis and an SD-based model for stylistic transfer and elevation rendering. Evaluation was conducted through both subjective professional scoring and objective metrics, including the Perceptual Hash Algorithm (pHash). Results demonstrate that CorbuAI achieves high accuracy in spatial allocation (scoring 0.88/1.0) and high structural consistency in elevation generation (mean pHash similarity of 0.82). The framework significantly reduces design iteration time while maintaining professional aesthetic standards. This research provides a scalable AI-driven methodology for automated residential design, bridging the gap between schematic layouts and visual representation in the Chinese architectural context.",

Measurements of temperature, relative humidity (RH), and sound pressure level (SPL), alongside questionnaire surveys assessing students’ concentration, environmental perceptions, and satisfaction, were conducted over ten continuous working days in four library rooms. The results revealed significant interactive effects between operative temperature (To), RH, and background noise level (LA90) on students’ concentration and overall satisfaction, highlighting the importance of an integrated approach to managing Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ). Furthermore, multi-objective optimization using the NSGA-II algorithm suggested optimal ranges for To (22.6–24.8 °C), RH (41.0–48.4%), and LA90 (45.0–48.5 dB(A)). Existing library conditions surpassed these optimal levels, particularly on the first floor, indicating a pressing need for interventions to enhance student well-being and academic performance. Overall, this study provides insights into the interactions between thermal comfort and acoustic quality, offering recommendations for creating more conducive learning environments that boost student satisfaction and performance.",

    "Abstract": "(1) Background: Hudson first described the procedure that includes en-block removal of an ovarian tumor fixed in the pelvis with the whole pelvic peritoneum and invaded surrounding structures. However, sometimes pelvic peritonectomy (PP) with or without shaving of the bowel serosa is not enough to achieve complete cytoreduction, and en-block rectosigmoid resection (RR) is necessary. This study aims to investigate the impact of bowel surgery on survival rates and morbidity of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. (2) Methods: We retrospectively analyzed patients with advanced ovarian cancer with cul-de-sac involvement that underwent debulking surgery at the 1st Department of Obstetrics—Gynecology of “Papageorgiou” General Hospital, from 2017–2022. The primary outcomes were the survival rates and morbidity between PP and RR. (3) Results: A total of 93 patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients were categorized into two groups: Group A (34 patients) with RR and Group B (59 patients) with PP. There was no statistically significant difference in the majority of patients’ characteristics and oncological outcomes. On the other hand, patients with RR had a significantly higher surgical complexity score (SCS), peritoneal cancer index (PCI), ICU admission, rate of postoperative complications, longer surgery duration and hospital stay. When comparing the duration of surgery, the RR group has significantly higher operation time during primary compared to interval debulking surgery. Concerning survival rates, there was no significant difference in progression-free (PFS) (p = 0.22) and overall survival (OS) (p = 0.85) between the two groups, while residual disease and postoperative complications were identified as independent prognostic factors for PFS and OS; (4) Conclusions: The modified Hudson procedure with RR is a safe and reproductible technique, but when complete gross resection can be achieved with PP, this technique is preferred in order to avoid increased patient’s morbidity.",

    "Abstract": "Despite extensive technological advances and an ever-growing body of literature, liquid biopsy has yet to achieve reliable early detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Numerous studies have investigated circulating tumor-derived components, including cell-free DNA (cfDNA), cell-free RNA (cfRNA), extracellular vesicles (EVs), and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), primarily using peripheral blood samples; however, their clinical utility for early-stage disease remains limited. The fundamental obstacles are biological rather than purely technical: early PDA and its precursor lesions, such as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN), are characterized by minimal tumor burden, low levels of nucleic acid shedding, and substantial background signals from non-neoplastic tissues. Increasing analytical complexity through multilayered liquid biopsy approaches, including analyses from pancreas-associated fluid, has not consistently translated into improved diagnostic performance and, in some cases, has amplified issues related to specificity, reproducibility, and interpretability. Moreover, molecular alterations detected in body fluids may reflect clonal expansion without inevitable malignant progression, raising concerns regarding overdiagnosis and clinical decision-making. Pre-analytical variability, lack of standardization, and limited access to tumor-adjacent fluids further hinder clinical implementation. Liquid biopsy should therefore be regarded as a complementary modality rather than a substitute for histopathological diagnosis, with its precise clinical role in early detection still ill-defined. In this review, we critically examine why liquid biopsy has not yet succeeded in early PDA detection, highlighting the key biological, technical, and clinical barriers that must be addressed to move the field beyond exploratory research toward meaningful clinical application.",

    "Abstract": "A promising route for removing antibiotics such as penicillin from wastewater is photocatalytic degradation under UV irradiation using TiO2 nanoparticles. However, the microscopic mechanisms governing the initial degradation steps remain poorly understood. In particular, it is still unclear whether degradation preferentially occurs in solution or upon adsorption on the oxide surface, and which molecular sites are most vulnerable to attack in solution compared to those activated on the catalyst. In this work, we introduce a unified density functional theory approach that treats penicillin V (phenoxymethylpenicillin) consistently, both isolated in solution and adsorbed on an anatase TiO2 nanocluster, enabling a direct comparison between solution-phase and surface-mediated degradation pathways. Within this framework, we analyze the adsorption configurations, energy-level alignment, charge-transfer pathways, UV-Vis absorption properties, local reactivity descriptors, and the initial steps leading to bond breaking. The results show that the direct photoexcitation of PenV followed by electron transfer to the oxide is less likely, due to the high energy of the pollutant’s excited states. In contrast, degradation initiated by the transfer of photogenerated holes from the catalyst to the adsorbed antibiotic appears more probable, driven by the smaller energetic offset and by the hybridization between molecular and oxide states. Overall, adsorption on the oxide surface appears to be more conducive to degradation, with the carbon atom in the β-lactam ring consistently identified as a susceptible site for attack across different environments.",

    "Abstract": "PCIF1 is primarily recognized as an RNA methyltransferase that mediates N6-methylation of cap-proximal adenosine (m6Am) and plays diverse roles in gene expression. In this study, we uncover a novel role for PCIF1 as a crucial negative regulator of type I interferon (IFN) induction, a pathway critical for antiviral immunity whose dysregulation leads to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We demonstrate that PCIF1 deficiency robustly enhances the poly(I:C)-induced type I IFN response, accompanied by augmented STAT1 activation and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Mechanistically, PCIF1 suppresses IFNB1 transcription by attenuating IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, as shown by increased nascent IFNB1 mRNA synthesis and promoter activity in PCIF1-deficient cells, without affecting the mRNA stability. Crucially, this suppressive function was independent of PCIF1’s canonical RNA methyltransferase activity, as both wild-type PCIF1 and a methyltransferase-inactive mutant effectively attenuated type I IFN induction. Collectively, our findings establish PCIF1 as a novel methyltransferase-independent suppressor of type I IFN responses, revealing its previously unrecognized non-catalytic function. This discovery offers critical insights into the multifaceted regulation of innate immunity and highlights PCIF1’s non-catalytic function as a promising therapeutic target for modulating antiviral responses and inflammatory diseases.",

    "Abstract": "Valorizing construction and demolition waste (CDW) via alkaline activation enables low-carbon binders. This study assesses binary geopolymers formulated with recycled brick powder (PLR) and recycled concrete powder (PCR) in seven precursor ratios (0–100% PCR), activated with a ternary NaOH/Na2SiO3/KOH solution (silicate modulus Ms ≈ 3.2) at L/B = 0.15, and cured for 7, 14, and 28 days. Compressive strength (fc), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) were used to link microstructure–phases–properties. A local maximum in fc at ~30% PCR (16.2 MPa at 28 d) was observed versus 0% PCR (14.2 MPa) and ≥50% PCR (13.8 → 10.1 MPa at 28 d). XRD indicated a reduction in inherited crystalline phases and an increased amorphous fraction at ~30% PCR; FTIR (normalized peak position and FWHM of the T–O–Si band, not absolute intensity) suggested higher network extension; SEM-EDS (local/semiquantitative) showed a moderate rise in Ca that supports C-A-S-H domains bridging the N-A-S-H network. At a high PCR, excess Ca simplified mineralogy (quartz/portlandite dominance), promoted competitive routes (C-S-H/carbonation), reintroduced microdefects, and reduced fc. A theoretical oxide balance per mix identified a compositional window where Ca/(Si + Al) ≈ 0.35–0.45 coincides with the mechanical optimum and with XRD/FTIR tracers. Overall, a ~30% PCR window maximizes co-reticulation of N-A-S-H/C-A-S-H and densification without compromising aluminosilicate continuity, providing transferrable design and process-control criteria for CDW-based geopolymer binders.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Laryngomalacia is the most common cause of inspiratory stridor in infancy. While most mild cases resolve spontaneously, severe cases may require surgical intervention. We report a case of severe laryngomalacia successfully treated with correction of glosso-larynx (CGL), a surgical procedure originally developed for ankyloglossia with deviation of the epiglottis and larynx (ADEL). Methods: A 2-month-old infant with severe symptoms was evaluated using objective anatomical and functional metrics. The patient underwent CGL under local anesthesia to release restrictive tension on the hyoid-larynx complex. Results: The patient showed rapid and sustained improvement in respiratory symptoms. At the one-month follow-up, endoscopic examination confirmed functional airway expansion with limited to no morbidity. Conclusions: This case demonstrates that CGL may represent a feasible and minimally invasive therapeutic option for selected cases of severe laryngomalacia, particularly those involving complex tongue–larynx dynamics.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating, inflammatory, and degenerative disease of the nervous system that may present in childhood or adolescence, defined as Pediatric-Onset Multiple Sclerosis (POMS). Among its diverse clinical manifestations, neurogenic bowel dysfunction (NBD), including chronic constipation and fecal incontinence, represents a distressing condition with a substantial impact on quality of life (QoL). Despite its clinical relevance, the evidence on bowel dysfunction in pediatric MS remains limited. The objective of this case series was to evaluate bowel dysfunction and its management in a pediatric MS cohort, and to assess whether it is associated with QoL. Methods: We reported the data on the urological and bowel conditions and on the quality of life of our pediatric patients affected by MS and urological dysfunction. We considered MS patients with urinary symptoms who were referred to our department between January 2019 and January 2024, only including individuals with symptoms onset before 18 years of age. In our series, the demographic and clinical data were reviewed, and patients were re-evaluated via telephone interview at least one year after initiation of treatment. The International Consultation on International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF), Pediatric Bowel Management Scoring Tool (PBMST), and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL, young adults’ version) were used to assess urinary and bowel function and related QoL outcomes. Results: Six patients (four females, two males; median age 14.5 years) were included. Bowel symptoms were reported in four cases (66.6%), predominantly constipation. The PBMST scores indicated overall fair bowel management, while the mean PedsQL score was 62.8/100, with poorer scores observed for the non-adherent patients. Conclusions: Bowel dysfunction constitutes an underrecognized but clinically significant manifestation in pediatric MS. Its early identification and adherence to a structured bowel management program seems to be crucial for optimizing symptom control and preserving quality of life. Standardized questionnaires represent effective, non-invasive tools for assessment and longitudinal monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "The Sacred Ibis Threskiornis aethiopicus is an invasive alien species (IAS) that has become established in many European countries. Because of its invasive status and its frequent interactions with native species, understanding the behavioural tolerance of this species to human disturbance is relevant for both conservation and management. Here, we analysed Flight Initiation Distances (FID) of T. aethiopicus recorded between 2012 and 2025 across the northern Adriatic coast. The dataset (n = 72) included approaches on foot and by boat in six habitat types (artificial saltmarshes, farmlands, brackish ponds, freshwater wetlands, saltmarshes, tidal flats). Mean FID was 41 m (SD = ± 24); it was affected mainly by group size, whereas habitat, season and approach mode had no clear effect. A cross-species analysis of mean FID versus body mass indicated that, for its size, T. aethiopicus has a much shorter FID than expected from the allometric relationship observed in 20 other waterbirds species for which FID was also collected (n = 1505) at the same sites. The results suggest partial habituation to anthropized environments and a limited flight response compared to native species. These findings may support management actions aimed at monitoring and controlling the expansion of the species while mitigating disturbance to native assemblages.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines in situ induction-heating thermal field assistance during laser cladding of Stellite 6 on 17-4PH stainless steel. Single-layer, multi-track coatings (~2.3 mm) were produced at induction powers of 0, 300, 600, and 900 W while keeping laser parameters constant. Surface morphology, phase constituents, and microstructures were characterized by LSCM, OM, XRD, SEM, EDS, and EBSD, and nanoscale features were probed by TEM for the 600 W condition; microhardness and coating-only tensile properties were evaluated. Thermal assistance improved surface finish (minimum Sa = 16.67 μm at 600 W) and suppressed hot cracking. XRD/EBSD revealed a γ-Co matrix with interdendritic carbides and an increased ε-Co fraction under thermal assistance; TEM further showed stacking-fault lamellae and a distinct FCC/HCP interface, supporting a fault-assisted, diffusionless γ → ε transformation. Increasing induction power coarsened the microstructure (larger DE and SDAS), decreasing hardness from 537.1 to 461.5 HV0.1 and lowering yield/ultimate strengths from 1046 MPa and 1512 MPa to 849 MPa and 1423 MPa, while elongation increased from 4.37% to 6.27%. Considering crack-free valve hardfacing with acceptable strength loss and improved ductility, 600 W provides the best overall performance.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, gellan gum microspheres (G–MPs) were developed as delivery systems for blueberry extract (Vaccinium myrtillus) (BEX), a source of natural antioxidants rich in anthocyanins (ATCs) and phenolic compounds (PHCs). Gellan gum, an anionic polysaccharide produced via fermentation by Sphingomonas elodea, was selected for its biocompatibility and gelling properties. BEX was obtained using a mild citric acid–based extraction method to preserve antioxidant capacity and was characterized for its total polyphenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin content before loading. The extract was loaded into gellan gum microspheres via absorption (G–MPs–BEX). The resulting microspheres exhibited a spherical and porous morphology that favoured both encapsulation and controlled release. FT–IR analysis confirmed the absorption of the extract within the polymer network and revealed hydrogen bonding interactions between the matrix and active compounds. Despite these interactions, microspheres retained a high swelling capacity and enabled rapid release, with maximum release of polyphenols and anthocyanins within 30 min at pH 5.5. The antioxidant activity of BEX, assessed via DPPH assay, remained stable during storage (up to 60 days) and after incorporation into the microspheres. Overall, this study demonstrates that G–MPs can efficiently absorb, stabilize, and release natural antioxidant compounds, supporting their potential use in biomedical, nutraceutical, and cosmetic applications.",

    "Abstract": "The use of styrylium dyes as organic nonlinear optical materials in many photonics domains has been the subject of research for decades. It has been noted that over time, research has also looked into the biological activity of styrylium dyes, namely their antibacterial effects, as well as attempts to establish links between structure and property by choosing particular structural pieces. These investigations’ scope is still very limited. Therefore, our main goal was to synthesize a styrylium compound with antimicrobial potential. A novel styrylquinolinium compound (D) was synthesized using Knoevenagel condensation. Spectroscopic techniques, including IR, 1D and 2D NMR (COSY, HSQC, and HMBC), HRMS spectra, and X-ray analysis, were used to confirm its structure. The antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity of the compound was assessed. The compound was found to have very good antimicrobial activity against five Gram-positive strains, three Gram-negative strains, and fungi. The most pronounced effect of the compound was against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The compound’s anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated through its ex vivo immunohistochemistry. DFT calculations, such as geometry optimization, Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP), HOMO–LUMO, reactivity parameters and molecular docking simulation were applied to investigate the electronic features of the compound and confirm the biological activity. The compound (D) demonstrated a promising antibacterial and immunomodulatory profile. Its ability to induce IL-1β and at the same time moderately reduce NOS3 can be considered as a controlled adaptation of the immune response, especially in cases requiring local immune activation. Docking simulation revealed that (D) binds effectively to the active site of the bacterial protein, supporting the experimental findings of the compound’s antibacterial activity.",

    "Abstract": "Monolayer MoS2 memtransistors offer gate-tunable hysteresis for neuromorphic reservoir computing, yet the role of operating window and fading-memory dynamics in CVD devices remains underexplored. We grow CVD monolayer MoS2, fabricate back-gated memtransistors, and use a single device as a time-multiplexed reservoir node for one-step Lorenz-63 prediction. Mobility, ON/OFF, hysteresis, and drift are quantified to identify stable, tunable bias regimes. We used a transistor with field-effect mobility on the order of 10 cm2 V−1 s−1, an ON/OFF ratio above 105, and a moderate hysteresis window quantified by H≈2.1μA·V at VDS=50 mV and H≈17μA·V at VDS=500 mV over VGS∈[−10,30] V. Performance is bias/memory-limited rather than FET-metric-limited. Sweeping gate-window and reservoir hyperparameters shows an optimum at intermediate hysteresis with moderate drift. Performance improves when the input clock matches the fading-memory time, achieving normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) = 0.09 for one-step Lorenz-63 x-prediction. Device-level statistics (discussed in the main text) show that, despite substantial scattering in electrical parameters, the resulting device-to-device NRMSE variation remains very small under fixed operating conditions. Classical FET metrics are not limiting here; NRMSE improvement instead requires engineering the hysteresis spectrum and gate stack. The demonstration of Lorenz-63 prediction using CVD-grown monolayer MoS2 memtransistors highlights their potential as a wafer-scalable platform for compact chaotic time-series predictions.",

Enfortumab vedotin, sacituzumab govitecan, and HER2-directed ADCs have demonstrated meaningful clinical activity across metastatic and earlier disease settings, with enfortumab vedotin plus pembrolizumab now established as a first-line standard of care. Despite these advances, therapeutic responses remain heterogeneous, and resistance frequently limits durability. This review summarizes current knowledge on predictors of response and mechanisms of resistance to ADCs in UC, highlighting the roles of target antigen expression and heterogeneity, genomic alterations, payload sensitivity, drug efflux transporters, and tumor microenvironmental factors. We discuss emerging biomarkers beyond antigen abundance, patterns of cross-resistance and treatment sequencing, and evolving strategies to overcome resistance, including next-generation ADC design and rational combination therapies. Advancing biomarker-driven patient selection and addressing mechanisms of resistance will be critical to maximizing the durability and clinical impact of ADCs in urothelial carcinoma.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a global healthcare issue associated with high mortality rates. Rapid diagnosis is of importance for the early selection of targeted therapy to improve patient outcomes. The use of rapid molecular assays with positive blood culture (BC) allows the identification (ID) of pathogens and the most relevant resistance determinants (RDs) in a shorter turnaround time, compared to standard culture. In this study, the performances of a new syndromic panel to determine the IDs and RDs of Gram-negative (GN) and Gram-positive (GP) bacteria were investigated in comparison with a standard-of-care (SoC) workflow. Methods: Two hospitals processed residual positive BC samples from non-replicated patients using Molecular Mouse (MM) Sepsis panels (Alifax, Padova, Italy) for GP ID, GN ID and RD detection. Results were compared with an SOC workflow based on subculture, ID by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry, phenotypic antibiogram, and real-time PCRs for RDs from isolated colonies. Results: A total of 140 and 136 residual positive BC samples were found to be valid for MM-ID and RD, respectively, yielding 76 GN and 76 GP species. Overall ID agreement at the species level was 136/152 (89%). RD agreement was 144/146 (99%). Regarding GN and GP species, ID agreement was 68/76 (89%) and 70/76 (92%), respectively. Conclusions: MM showed high sensitivity in RD detection; however, some discrepancies with results of the SoC workflow were observed, represented by reduced sensitivity for some species-specific IDs. Panel size and compact instrument dimension can be seen as the principal advantage of this modular molecular assay for the rapid detection of pathogens responsible for BSIs.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Thymomas are the most common tumors of the anterior mediastinum. While early-stage disease often has a favorable prognosis, therapeutic options in advanced stages remain limited. Moreover, the molecular profile of thymomas is still poorly characterized. In the present study, we explored the presence of targetable mutations and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in a cohort of surgically resected thymomas. Furthermore, we investigated the correlation between PD-L1 expression, histological subtype, and risk of recurrence in patients who underwent curative-intent thymectomy. Methods: Mutational profiling was performed using a DNA-based NGS Cancer Panel of 16 genes. PD-L1 expression was evaluated via Tumor Proportion Score (TPS), and thymomas with TPS ≥ 50% were identified as high expressors. The associations with histological subtype and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed using logistic regression, Cox proportional hazards models, and Kaplan–Meier survival curves. Results: In our study, 2/37 (5.4%) of tested neoplasms (type AB and B2 thymoma) reported as a PIK3CA mutation; no other targetable mutations were observed. Moreover, high PD-L1 expression (≥50%) was reported in (15/37) 40.5% of patients and was significantly associated with aggressive histological subtypes (B2 and B3) (p &lt; 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that high PD-L1 expression was a significant predictor of aggressive histology (McFadden’s R2 = 0.268, p &lt; 0.001), with an odds ratio of 15.5 (95% CI: 2.9–83.4; p = 0.001). During follow-up, 5/37 (13.5%) of patients experienced disease recurrence; however, no significant difference in DFS was found between high and low PD-L1 expression groups. Conclusions: Our data confirm the presence of PIK3CA mutations in thymomas and encourage the exploration the potential role of molecular target therapy in this setting. Moreover, we underlined that high PD-L1 expression level is associated with more aggressive thymoma subtypes and may have a role as a prognostic biomarker. These findings support the need for further studies on the potential role of molecular and predictive pathology in thymic epithelial tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Bone age assessment is critical in pediatric endocrinology and forensic medicine. Although recently developed multimodal large language models (LLMs) show potential in medical imaging, their diagnostic performance in bone age determination has not been sufficiently evaluated. This study evaluates the performance of four multimodal LLMs (ChatGPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok-3, and Claude 4 Sonnet) in bone age determination using the Gilsanz–Ratib (GR) atlas. Methods: This retrospective study included 245 pediatric patients (109 male, 136 female) under the age of 18 who underwent left wrist radiography. Each model estimated bone age using the patient’s radiograph and GR atlas as reference (atlas-assisted prompting). Bone age assessments made by an experienced radiologist using the GR atlas were evaluated as the reference standard. Performance was assessed using mean absolute error (MAE), intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and Bland–Altman analysis. Results: ChatGPT-5 demonstrated statistically superior performance, with an MAE of 1.46 years and ICC of 0.849, showing the highest alignment with the reference standard. Gemini 2.5 Pro showed moderate performance, with an MAE of 2.24 years; Grok-3 (MAE: 3.14 years) and Claude 4 Sonnet (MAE: 4.29 years) had error rates that were too high for clinical use. Conclusions: Significant performance differences exist among multimodal LLMs, despite atlas-supported prompting. Only ChatGPT-5 qualified as “clinically useful,” demonstrating potential as an auxiliary tool or educational support under expert supervision. Other models’ reliability remains insufficient.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cardiotoxicity is a major limitation of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for thoracic and systemic cancers, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality among survivors. Early prediction and prevention are critical to balance oncologic efficacy with cardiovascular safety. Artificial intelligence (AI) offers powerful tools to improve risk stratification, enable earlier detection of subclinical injury, and guide treatment planning in cardio-oncology. Methods: We performed a comprehensive review of the literature on AI applications for cancer therapy-related cardiotoxicity. Evidence was identified from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, focusing on electrocardiography, biomarkers, proteomics, extracellular vesicles, genomics, advanced imaging (echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, computed tomography, nuclear imaging), and radiotherapy dose modeling (dosiomics). Translational insights from animal models and in vitro systems were also included. Methodological quality was appraised with reference to TRIPOD-AI, PROBAST-AI, and CLAIM standards. Results: AI applications span multiple domains. Machine learning models integrating biomarkers, exosomes, and extracellular vesicles show promise for noninvasive early detection. Deep learning enables automated analysis of echocardiographic strain and cardiac MRI mapping, while radiomics and dosiomics approaches combine imaging with cardiac substructure dose maps to predict and prevent late radiation-induced injury. Preclinical studies demonstrate AI-driven advances in small-animal imaging, histopathology quantification, and multi-omics data integration, supporting the discovery of translational biomarkers. Despite encouraging performance, most models remain limited by small cohorts, methodological heterogeneity, and scarce external validation. Conclusions: AI has the potential to transform cardio-oncology by shifting from reactive detection to proactive prevention of cardiotoxicity. Future research should prioritize multimodal integration, harmonized multicenter datasets, prospective validation, and guideline-based clinical trials. As emerging data are incorporated, the field is expanding rapidly—dynamic, complex, and evolving.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Manual review of EEG recordings in clinical settings is inherently time-consuming and labor-intensive. These challenges highlight a pressing need for automated EEG analysis tools capable of supporting clinicians by improving efficiency and diagnostic accuracy. Objectives: This study aims to develop and validate an AI-based model for the automated interpretation of adult EEG recordings. Unlike previous approaches that emphasize seizure detection during ictal states, our model targets the early prediction of seizure risk through systematic annotation and recognition of interictal patterns. Methods: The model is designed to accurately distinguish between normal and abnormal EEGs, encompassing both interictal and ictal activity. Abnormal EEGs will be further classified into three clinically relevant categories: (1) non-epileptiform abnormalities such as focal or diffuse slowing, (2) epileptiform discharges, and (3) electrographic seizures. Three AI-based classification algorithms were implemented: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Results: RF demonstrated optimal performance across most tasks, achieving 96.50% accuracy for normal activity identification. This AI-driven system enhances the efficiency, consistency, and accessibility of EEG interpretation. It is particularly valuable in settings with limited access to neurophysiologists and offers an innovative approach to improving diagnostic timelines and clinical decision-making.

    "Abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa’s cereal yields remain ~60% below global benchmarks, while unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) adoption in smallholder systems averages below 2–3% across major economies, revealing a performance–adoption disconnect that requires systematic investigation. This Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 synthesis of 127 sources quantifies the performance of UAV sensors and identifies mechanisms that constrain their adoption across regional agricultural systems. Random-effects meta-analysis synthesized evidence from 81 quantitative studies, yielding 101 total observations. Pooled detection accuracy was estimated from 49 studies contributing 52 observations (mean 90.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 89.8–92.6%). Yield prediction performance was assessed from 32 studies contributing 49 observations (pooled coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.841, 95% CI: 0.827–0.855), validating technical feasibility. Cost-effectiveness analysis reveals significant performance–price differentiation: red-green-blue (RGB) sensors achieve 89.4% accuracy at United States Dollar (USD) 16.50 per percentage point versus hyperspectral systems at 93.7% accuracy but at USD 132.17 per point, resulting in a 25.6 times cost differential. Yield prediction models demonstrate robust performance (R2 = 0.81; cereal crops R2 = 0.82). Barrier analysis identifies economic constraints as the primary limiter, with capital requirements reaching 0.8–3.1 times the annual smallholder income. Infrastructure deficits impose secondary constraints, particularly in rural electrification, below 50%. Case study synthesis reveals that coordinated interventions addressing multiple barriers simultaneously—cooperative ownership, off-grid infrastructure, and streamlined regulation—achieve substantially higher adoption than isolated approaches. Engineering economics positions RGB platforms for individual deployment and multispectral systems for cooperative scales (20–50 farmers), establishing feasible deployment pathways for tens of million regional smallholder operations.",

    "Abstract": "We present a fully controlled thermodynamic study of the two-dimensional dipolar Q-state clock model on small square lattices with free boundaries, combining exhaustive state enumeration with noise-free evaluation of canonical observables. We resolve the complete energy spectra and degeneracies {En,cn} for the Ising case (Q=2) on lattices of size L=3,4,5, and for clock symmetries Q=4,6,8 on a 3×3 lattice, tracking how the competition between exchange and long-range dipolar interactions reorganizes the low-energy manifold as the ratio α=D/J is varied. Beyond a finite-size characterization, we identify several qualitatively new thermodynamic signatures induced solely by dipolar anisotropy. First, we demonstrate that ground-state level crossings generated by long-range interactions appear as exact zeros of the specific heat in the limit C(T→0,α), establishing an unambiguous correspondence between microscopic spectral rearrangements and macroscopic caloric response. Second, we show that the shape of the associated Schottky-like anomalies encodes detailed information about the degeneracy structure of the competing low-energy states: odd lattices (L=3,5) display strongly asymmetric peaks due to unbalanced multiplicities, whereas the even lattice (L=4) exhibits three critical values of α accompanied by nearly symmetric anomalies, reflecting paired degeneracies and revealing lattice parity as a key organizing principle. Third, we uncover a symmetry-driven crossover with increasing Q: while the Q=2 and Q=4 models retain sharp dipolar-induced critical points and pronounced low-temperature structure, for Q≥6, the energy landscape becomes sufficiently smooth to suppress ground-state crossings altogether, yielding purely thermal specific-heat maxima. Altogether, our results provide a unified, size- and symmetry-resolved picture of how long-range anisotropy, lattice parity, and discrete rotational symmetry shape the thermodynamics of mesoscopic magnetic systems. We show that dipolar interactions alone are sufficient to generate nontrivial critical-like caloric behavior in clusters as small as 3×3, establishing exact finite-size benchmarks directly relevant for van der Waals nanomagnets, artificial spin-ice arrays, and dipolar-coupled nanomagnetic structures.",

    "Abstract": "The global carbon cycle has become increasingly unbalanced over the past century as anthropogenic fluxes into the atmosphere far exceed the sequestration capacity of land and ocean systems. Data from 2025 show estimated annual anthropogenic emissions of ≈11.2 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC), while only ≈5.6 GtC are sequestered by land and ocean sinks mainly provided by photosynthetic CO2 fixation. The resulting surplus of carbon emissions has led to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations above pre-industrial values to ≈430 ppm, which is a major driver of increasingly erratic climatic phenomena. Recent data indicate that fossil fuel use will continue rising up to and beyond 2050, largely negating the drive to cut CO2 emissions as recommended by the IPCC and other reputable transnational bodies. Hence, there is an urgent need to reduce atmospheric CO2 levels via carbon sequestration. This review focuses on the proven capacity of biological mechanisms to sequester CO2 at a global scale with an annual capacity in the range of gigatonnes of carbon. New measures such as re- and a-forestation, plus improved and more sustainable management of tropical tree crops, can further increase the carbon sequestration potential of these plants. By implementing these and other nature-based solutions, the highly productive tropical vegetation belt could contribute an additional 1–2 Gt of carbon sequestration via natural forests and perennial tree crops. In order to expedite this process, we examine the use of new modalities of transparent carbon trading systems that include selected tropical crops. As highlighted at COP30 in Brazil and elsewhere, this would enable tropical countries to derive benefit for costs incurred in land management changes such as reforestation, regenerative farming, and intercropping to benefit smallholders and other rural communities. In particular, carbon finance is emerging as a critical driver, with appropriately regulated and transparent carbon credit schemes offering fungible monetary compensation for climate-positive land management.",

    "Abstract": "Decades of research have documented the critical role of parental practices, beliefs, and resources in shaping children’s literacy development. This study examined how home practices shape children’s literacy engagement across both digital and traditional formats. Parents of children aged 4–9 years (N = 357) filled out a Qualtrics survey about the home learning environment, including beliefs, confidence, attitudes, resources, and practices. Results showed that while parents’ beliefs and traditional literacy engagement were linked to encouragement for digital reading, children’s independent digital reading was best predicted by parents’ own digital reading, shared digital reading, and encouragement to read on devices. Device availability and general encouragement to use technology were not significant. Children’s audiobook use was predicted primarily by shared digital reading. These findings extend the home literacy environment literature by showing that while traditional practices remain central, their expression in the digital age depends on parental modeling and encouragement. The results highlight that in the digital era, parental engagement and shared reading experiences, and not access alone, are central to fostering children’s digital literacy development.",

    "Abstract": "As intelligent vehicle technologies evolve, reliable driver monitoring systems have become increasingly critical for ensuring the safety of human drivers and operational reliability. This paper proposes a novel visual computing framework for Driver Fatigue Monitoring Systems (DFMSs) based on hierarchical decoupling and scenario element analysis, specifically designed for intelligent transportation environments. By treating the monitoring system as an engineering-level embodied perception–decision system deployed within the vehicle, rather than a purely disembodied vision module, the framework decouples low-level algorithmic perception from application-layer decision logic, enabling a more granular evaluation of visual computing performance in real-world scenarios. We leverage Python 3.9-driven automated test case generation to simulate diverse environmental variables, improving testing efficiency by 50% over traditional manual methods. The system utilizes deep learning-based visual computing to achieve high-fidelity monitoring of eye closure (PERCLOS, EAR), yawning (MAR), and head pose dynamics, enabling real-time assessment of the driver’s state within the embodied system loop. Comparative benchmarking reveals that our framework significantly outperforms existing models in visual understanding accuracy, achieving perfect confidence scores (1.000) for eye closure and smoking behavior detection, while drastically reducing false positives in mobile phone usage detection (misidentification rate: 0.016 vs. 0.805). These results demonstrate that an embodied approach to visual perception enhances the robustness and reliability of driver monitoring systems deployed in real vehicles, providing a scalable pathway for the development of next-generation intelligent transportation safety standards.",

    "Abstract": "This paper addresses the growing need for reliable methods to evaluate the quality of artificial intelligence (AI) systems as they become widely used in both critical domains and everyday applications. The study aims to develop a metric-based approach to assessing AI system quality by harmonising product quality and quality in use models in line with updated international standards. To achieve this, the authors analyse existing ISO/IEC 25000 series standards, identifying inconsistencies between older and newer versions, and propose an updated quality model that incorporates both perspectives. Building on guidance documents, international standards, and contemporary research, the study introduces a set of metrics designed to measure new subcharacteristics of AI system quality, particularly where standardised metrics have not yet been developed. The proposed approach bridges the gap between established quality models (ISO/IEC 25010:2023, ISO/IEC 25019:2023, ISO/IEC 25059:2023) and standardised measurement practices (ISO/IEC 25023:2016, ISO/IEC 25022:2016), enabling more consistent and practical evaluation of AI systems. These metrics can be applied by researchers and practitioners to improve the quality of AI systems, enhance their reliability, and reduce risks associated with insufficient quality. Future work will focus on empirical validation of the proposed approach to confirm its applicability and usefulness across diverse AI applications.",

    "Abstract": "Implementing medium-voltage DC (MVDC) grids in ship power systems has many intricacies, such as larger fault currents, the inability to include conventional protection systems, etc.; however, this has not been deeply investigated. To circumvent these intricacies, it is important to understand the characteristics of MVDC grids installed in a ship power system environment. A feasible method to achieve this is to model the grid components in terms of their equivalent circuit and study their typical behaviour under fault conditions. Being a DC circuit, the steady-state grid parameters of the ship power system are predominantly resistive in nature; therefore, the pertinent circuit model approach remains theoretically adequate. Pertinent results and information gathered from such studies might provide a clear insight into the typical behaviour of MVDC grids under faults and help to resolve their diagnostic integrity. In this context, a simulation study that aims to understand the influence of inherent circuit parameters of MVDC grid components under normal and fault conditions is initiated. First, a circuit model that adequately represents a 2 MW MVDC grid is selected, and its transient and steady-state behaviours under normal and fault conditions are studied. The grid components (i.e., generator, converters, etc.) are modelled with r, l, and c parameters in such a way that the steady-state and transient nature of the grid elements are theoretically represented. Later, the influence of these circuit representations during short-circuit faults in different sections of the DC grid is studied. Pertinent results reveal that the circuit representations of grid components manifest significant impact under fault conditions and induce damped-out oscillations superimposed on grid voltage and currents. This information is essential to developing smart fault protection systems operating independently of the main grid control algorithm and might help to enhance safety features along with grid resilience and reliability.",

    "Abstract": "With the rapid development of renewable energy technologies, numerous distributed energy resources (DERs) have been integrated into power systems. How to fully exploit renewable energy while maintaining the stable operation of power systems remains an urgent challenge. Furthermore, the diversity of DERs’ ownership requires scheduling approaches that account for the distinct interests and characteristics of multiple stakeholders. To address these challenges, this study introduces a two-stage operational optimization framework for the virtual power plant (VPP), which is grounded in a Stackelberg game model. This strategy innovatively combines two conventional control methods: the day-ahead stage employs direct control for global pre-scheduling, leveraging its cost optimization capability; the intraday stage utilizes dynamic pricing to guide prosumers, tapping into DERs’ flexibility while accommodating their individual energy usage preferences. The Stackelberg game is resolved through a tiered solution methodology employing particle swarm optimization (PSO). To enhance solution efficiency, a Kriging surrogate model is introduced to replace the prosumers’ models, significantly reducing the computational burden of the PSO. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed strategy can balance operating costs and energy usage preferences, and the proposed solution approach can significantly enhance solution efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "As a core power supply component of the more electric aircraft (MEA), the reliability of the permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) is of paramount importance. Phase current reconstruction technology can enhance the redundancy of current sensors, thereby improving system reliability. However, owing to the generally high engine speeds in MEAs, the employment of traditional d-axis current–zero control not only induces DC-link voltage fluctuations but also leads to inaccurate DC-link sampling points and distortion in the reconstructed current. In this paper, a lead-angle flux-weakening control strategy is introduced into the PMSG rectification system. This approach guarantees the normal operation of the current loop when the rotational speed exceeds the rated speed of the PMSG, ensuring the accuracy of the sampling points for phase current reconstruction. To further enhance the reconstruction accuracy, a phase current reconstruction technology based on a linear extended state observer (LESO) is proposed. The LESO not only filters the reconstructed current but also ensures that the observer performance remains robust against PMSG parameter perturbations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through Hardware-in-the-Loop results.",

SHAP value decomposition and feature importance reveals that total energy consumption and energy consumption intensity remain the dominant contributors to carbon and pollution emissions, while the secondary industry still emerges as a critical driver.

    "Abstract": "Vans (light commercial vehicles) account for only about 11% of the European light-duty vehicle fleet. However, they are mostly used in urban delivery and service operations where frequent stop-and-go driving increases tyre abrasion. Furthermore, their annual mileage is on average more than 70% higher than that of passenger cars. For these reasons, vans are estimated to generate tyre wear emissions that are at least 2.5 times higher than those of passenger cars on a per-vehicle basis, and therefore make a disproportionate contribution to microplastic pollution in cities. The Euro 7 pollutant emission standards introduce, for the first time, regulatory limits on tyre abrasion for passenger car tyres (C1 class) from 2028 and for light-commercial-vehicle tyres (C2 class) from 2030, building on United Nations (UN) tyre testing procedures developed under UN Regulation 117. While two candidate test methods (a real-world method and a laboratory method) have been agreed on for C1 tyres, no equivalent standard exists yet for C2 tyres, and very few experimental data have been published so far. In this study, we adapt the C1 real-world-based method to winter C2 tyres (snow three-peak mountain snowflake, 3PMSF) fitted to vans, and we discuss the practical and regulatory challenges encountered. The resulting abrasion rate and abrasion level indices provide first experimental emission factors for C2 tyres and can inform the ongoing development of regulatory test procedures and limit values for van tyres. We also develop an experimental and analytical framework to relate abrasion measurements to tyre service life (mileage potential).",

    "Abstract": "The increasing demand for alcohol-free craft beers with functional properties and distinctive sensory attributes has motivated the brewing industry to investigate alternative production strategies, such as the application of non-Saccharomyces yeasts, to obtain sour beers while reducing production time and associated costs. This study explores the combined use of Lachancea thermotolerans L31 and Metschnikowia pulcherrima M29 in the production of beers brewed with blueberries or enriched with grape anthocyanin concentrate. Physicochemical parameters such as pH, color, bitterness, total polyphenols, antioxidant capacity, and anthocyanin and volatile profiles were evaluated, and a sensory analysis was performed. The results showed that both the addition of blueberries and that of anthocyanin concentrate and fermentation with Lachancea and Metschnikowia significantly influenced the chemical and sensory properties of the beer. Mainly, pH values decreased from 4.35 to 3.50 and from 3.69 to 3.26, while antioxidant activity increased from 3 to 10 times, depending on the type of yeast and the addition of fruit. Alcohol content remained constant at approximately 5.0% v/v. This strategy allows for the production of beer with a distinctive profile and functional benefits, representing a step forward in craft beer development and opening new avenues for research and innovation in the sector.",

    "Abstract": "Deep learning has become an important approach for automated software vulnerability detection. However, due to domain shift, existing models often suffer from significant performance degradation when applied to unseen projects. To address this issue, prior studies have widely adopted Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques to improve cross-project generalization. Nevertheless, these methods typically rely on the implicit “project-as-domain” assumption and require access to target project data during training, which limits their applicability in practice. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a vulnerability detection framework that combines semantic clustering with ensemble-based Domain Generalization (DG), termed Cluster-based Ensemble Learning for Vulnerability Detection (CEVD). CEVD first performs unsupervised clustering on code semantic embeddings to automatically automatically identify latent semantic structures that transcend project boundaries, constructing pseudo-domains with intra-domain homogeneity. A soft domain labeling strategy is further introduced to model the membership of samples in multiple pseudo-domains, preserving semantic overlap across boundaries. Building upon this, CEVD employs an ensemble learning framework that jointly trains multiple expert models and a domain classifier. The predictions of these experts are dynamically fused based on the weights generated by the domain classifier, enabling effective vulnerability detection on unseen projects without requiring access to target data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that CEVD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across different pre-trained backbone models. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of semantic structure mining in capturing latent domains and offers a practical solution for improving generalization in cross-project vulnerability detection.",

    "Abstract": "Grape pomace represents a major organic solid waste generated by the wine industry, but its application has been largely unexplored. On the other hand, so far, stable and sustainable raw materials for producing stable, edible Pickering emulsifiers suitable for the food industry have been lacking. To solve these problems, this study established a mild but effective co-extraction method to obtain protein–polysaccharide–polyphenol ternary complexes (GPTCs) from grape pomace. Subsequently, these complexes were directly developed into an edible Pickering emulsifier by a pH-controlled method. Results showed that a series of properties related to the Pickering emulsifier, such as particle size, surface charge, wettability, and interfacial adsorption behavior, could be easily controlled by adjusting the solution’s pH. Consequently, the GPTC prepared at pH 7.0 exhibited optimal emulsifying performance. The resulting particles had an average particle size of approximately 111 nm, and stabilized Pickering emulsions with a volume-weighted mean oil droplet diameter (D [4,3]) of 9.49 μm, indicating high emulsion stability. Collectively, this study provided an actionable approach for the green, high-value utilization of wine byproducts by establishing a pH-responsive design framework for edible Pickering emulsifiers.",

    "Abstract": "Agri-food industries generate substantial quantities of side streams such as peels, pods, seeds, and leaves. Traditionally regarded as waste, these by-products are now recognized as rich sources of bioactive compounds—often at higher concentrations than those found in edible plant parts. Their recovery reduces environmental impact and enables the development of sustainable ingredients for food and health-related applications, in line with circular economy principles. This study presents the design and metabolomic characterization of a novel lyophilized powder derived from Mediterranean and locally cultivated plant-based by-products (named BIOMEDER), including orange, lemon, olive leaves, carob pods, shiitake mushroom, and salicornia. A multiplatform metabolomics approach was applied, combining high-resolution UPLC-QTOF-MS, UHPLC-QTRAP-MS, SPME-GC-MS, and 1H-NMR spectroscopy to comprehensively profile phytochemicals, nutrients, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The powder was found to be rich in flavonoids (e.g., luteolin-7-O-glucoside, hesperidin, eriocitrin), phenolic acids, amino acids (e.g., proline, GABA), organic acids (e.g., malic and citric acid), and over 40 VOCs associated with antioxidant and sensory functions. Notably, high concentrations of these compounds suggest potential health-promoting properties. These findings might support the formulation of a potential functional plant-based supplement and reinforce the value of integrating diverse agro-industrial by-products into sustainable, health-oriented food solutions.",

    "Abstract": "The preservation of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables through dehydration is undergoing a paradigm shift to overcome quality degradation and high energy intensity associated with conventional thermal drying. This review synthesizes advancements in innovative pretreatments, focusing on their mechanisms, synergistic effects, and industrial readiness. Non-thermal pretreatment (NTP) methods—including Pulsed Electric Fields (PEF), Ultrasound (US), Cold Plasma (CP), and High-Pressure Processing (HPP)—are evaluated alongside optimized Osmotic Dehydration (OD) and Freeze-Thaw (FT) cycles. Analysis reveals these technologies enhance drying kinetics, reducing processing time by 20–55%, while improving bioactive retention by 30–95%. A critical discussion of Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) distinguishes commercially mature solutions like OD (TRL 9) and HPP (TRL 8–9) from emerging pilot-scale concepts like US and PEF (TRL 6–7). Cold Plasma remains at TRL 4–5 due to uniformity challenges. Furthermore, the higher capital expenditure of innovative systems is mitigated by operational energy savings (up to 50%) and “clean label” premiums. This paper provides a strategic framework to optimize pretreatment selection based on tissue matrices and economic viability.",

    "Abstract": "Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) is a climate-resilient cereal with significant potential as a functional food due to its distinctive polyphenolic profile, including rare 3-deoxyanthocyanidins (3-DXAs). Broader utilisation of sorghum is limited by low protein digestibility and the presence of anti-nutritional factors, such as condensed tannins and phytates. This review consolidates current evidence on germination as a bioprocessing strategy to address these limitations and enhance the bioactivity of sorghum polyphenols. Germination activates endogenous hydrolytic enzymes, such as phytases and esterases, and upregulates the phenylpropanoid pathway through phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, which promotes the release of cell wall-bound phenolic acids and the de novo synthesis of flavonoids. A “germination paradox” is identified, in which qualitative shifts toward lower-molecular-weight, more bioaccessible aglycones enhance antioxidant and anti-inflammatory efficacy, even when total phenolic content fluctuates. The review also examines the effects of germination on digestive release, transepithelial transport, and colonic microbial transformation of phenolics. Finally, genotype- and process-dependent optimisation windows, typically 48–72 h, are delineated to balance anti-nutrient reduction with phytochemical retention, providing a basis for the development of germinated sorghum-based functional foods and nutraceuticals.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigated Brazilian consumers’ perceptions, attitudes, and purchase intentions regarding traditional and reformulated chicken meat products (fresh sausage and burger) enriched with natural antioxidants obtained from avocado by-product extracts. A mixed-methods approach was applied, using a word association task, a Likert-scale attitudinal questionnaire, and purchase intention scales (n = 422). Word association revealed predominantly negative perceptions toward products containing synthetic antioxidants, while natural antioxidant formulations elicited positive associations related to health, naturalness, and sustainability. Attitudinal data indicated strong alignment between health consciousness, environmental concern, and openness to food innovation. Pearson correlations (p &lt; 0.05) showed moderate-to-strong relationships (r ≥ 0.40) among beliefs about healthy eating, perceived benefits of natural antioxidants, and support for sustainable production. Contingency analyses demonstrated that belief in the health benefits of natural antioxidants significantly increased purchase intention for reformulated products, whereas consumers less engaged with healthy eating were more accepting of synthetic formulations. Noting sample limitations primarily comprising young, educated females, who correspond to the group of consumers who tend to be more sensitive to health and environmental responsibility claims, the findings highlight consumer interest in natural, functional, and sustainable meat products. These results reinforce the potential of using agro-industrial by-product extracts as natural antioxidants in meat formulations and underscore the importance of communication strategies emphasizing health, naturalness, and sustainability to improve consumer acceptance.",

Through optimization of the extraction solution and extraction time, acetonitrile–PBS was selected as the extraction solution with an extraction time of 5 min as the optimal pretreatment condition. Optimizing the dilution ratio of antigen antibodies, the optimal detection conditions were selected as the dilution ratios of 1:8000 and 1:20,000 for the triazolone monoclonal antibody solution and biotinylated triazolone solution, and 1:4000 and 1:20,000 for the tebuconazole monoclonal antibody solution and biotinylated tebuconazole solution, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, the method demonstrated that the limits of detection (LOD) of triazolone and tebuconazole were 0.002835 μg·mL−1 and 0.00064 μg·mL−1, respectively. The recovery rate was between 90.1% and 103.6%, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was lower than 10%. The cross-reaction rates for structural analogs were all less than 0.1%, showing good specificity. In actual sample detection, this method did not detect triazolone and tebuconazole, and the results were consistent with UHPLC-MS/MS.",

    "Abstract": "Mounting volumes of fruit processing by-products pose an environmental challenge, yet these wastes harbor rich polyphenol reservoirs locked within plant cell walls. Fermentation has emerged as a green biotransformation strategy to unlock these bound antioxidants without the need for chemical solvents, converting waste streams into value-added nutraceutical ingredients. This review summarizes recent advances in fermenting fruit by-products to boost their total polyphenol content (TPC) and antioxidant capacity, illustrating fermentation’s role in both functional enhancement and sustainable waste valorization. Across diverse fruit substrates, microbial fermentation consistently increases TPC and enhances antioxidant activity, demonstrating significant functional enrichment. More importantly, unlike conventional solvent extraction, fermentation-driven valorization reduces chemical waste and allows full incorporation of the biomass into edible products, including bakery products, beverages, and fermented dairy alternatives. This sustainable approach aligns with circular economy principles by turning food waste into functional ingredients, effectively bridging nutritional enhancement with environmental responsibility. Overall, the findings highlight fermentation as an innovative pathway for waste upcycling in the food system, opening new avenues for antioxidant-rich, zero-waste products and their integration into sustainable food ingredient development, while also indicating that the main barrier to industrial translation lies not in functional efficacy but in process compatibility, reproducibility, and scalability under realistic food processing conditions.",

Bioactive evaluation showed a significant increase in total phenolic and flavonoid contents, followed by improved DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP activities. A reduction in tannins and phytic acid correlated with enhanced in vitro protein digestibility.

Identified by NMR with purities above 93%, they were DFA III (1), DFA VII (2), DFA II (3), β-D-Fructofuranose-1,2′:2,1′-β-D-Fructofuranose (4), DFA I (5), sucrose (6), and 1-kestose (7). Compounds 1–5 were newly isolated from WPR, and their contents increased post-processing. Measurements of color values, total reducing sugars, and the abundant DFA III and DFA I at different processing stages revealed a progressive darkening of the slices with more steaming cycles, showing a strong correlation between total color difference (Eab*) and sugar component changes. Additionally, DFA III and DFA I levels were much higher in commercial WPR than in raw material, suggesting these difructose anhydrides as potential markers for WPR.",

    "Abstract": "The Jurassic lacustrine oil shale in southwest China has become a primary production layer due to its high yield and substantial reserves. However, influenced by the lacustrine environment, the vertical profile of the lacustrine shale reservoir shows alternating deposits of shale and carbonate rock. This complex lithological combination results in significant heterogeneity in reservoir types, reservoir distribution, and internal structure. Currently, research on micro-pore structure and hydrocarbon storage mechanisms in lacustrine shales is insufficient, necessitating the elucidation of their micro-characteristics to support future exploration and development. This research focuses on the Da’anzhai Member of Jurassic Ziliujing Formation. Various techniques—including organic geochemical analysis, X-ray diffraction, physical property testing, gradient centrifugation, and gradient drying NMR monitoring—were employed to investigate the micro-pore structure and fluid storage mechanisms of the lacustrine shale reservoir. The following insights were gained from this research. The organic matter pores (OMP) and inorganic pores (IP) developed within the Da’anzhai lacustrine shale reservoir together create the storage space for shale oil, while micro-fractures further enhance the reservoir’s storage capacity and flow performance. Lacustrine shale oil exists in three storage states: mobile oil, bound oil, and adsorbed oil. Mobile oil is primarily located within the micro-fractures and large pores (greater than 350 nm) of the shale reservoir and is the main target for industrial extraction. Bound oil is mainly found in the meso-pores, micropores, and narrow pore structures between rock grains (30 nm to 350 nm), and, theoretically, could potentially be developed through engineering methods such as hydraulic fracturing. Adsorbed oil, due to its close binding with organic matter and clay mineral surfaces, is difficult to release effectively using conventional techniques. The OM abundance, the mineral composition of lacustrine shale, and the pore structure all influence the storage states of shale oil. While a high TOC value increases the amount of mobile oil, the strong adsorption properties of kerogen and organic matter lead to the accumulation of adsorbed oil, which inhibits oil flow. Clay minerals further restrict oil flow by enhancing adsorption, while brittle minerals facilitate the movement of mobile oil by expanding pore space. Based on fractal geometry theory and multi-scale testing results, the large pores in the Da’anzhai lacustrine shale have a high fractal dimension and exhibit complex shapes. However, as pore complexity increases, the amount of adsorbed oil rises significantly, which in turn reduces the proportion of movable oil.",

    "Abstract": "In South Asia, smog has become a critical environmental concern that endangers public health, ecosystems, and the regional climate. To determine the primary causes of smog formation in Lahore during peak polluted months (October and November), the current study develops a dual analytical framework that combines cutting-edge machine learning with sector- and pollutant-specific emission analysis. To assess their relationship with Air Quality Index (AQI) and create a high-accuracy predictive model, meteorological factors and emission data from key sectors are used to build Random Forest and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models. The current study evaluates the joint effects of weather and emission loads on AQI variability by integrating atmospheric dynamics with comprehensive emission profiles. The XGBoost model forecasts important pollutants from the transportation, industrial, and agricultural sectors, including carbon dioxide (CO2), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter, in the second analytical tier. Particulate matter (PM), NOx, and transport-related pollutants are consistently identified by the models as the primary predictors of AQI, with high prediction performance. Furthermore, a 3-fold split is used for cross-validation, making sure that each fold maintained the data’s chronological order to avoid leakage. The model has modest root mean square error (RMSE) levels (4.32 and 8.14) and high coefficient of determination (R2) values (0.93–0.99). Approximately 90% of Lahore’s annual emissions resulted from the transportation sector. These results offer aid to policymakers to anticipate air quality, identify important emission sources, and execute targeted initiatives to minimize smog and promote a healthier urban environment. The current study also helps in analyzing the causes of atmospheric and sectoral pollution. While the study captures smog dynamics during peak pollution months, its temporal scope is limited, and finer spatial measurements could further improve the generalizability of the results.",

    "Abstract": "Microbial biofilms pose significant health risks by causing infections associated with prosthetic and indwelling medical devices. Factors such as the high tolerance levels of biofilm microorganisms to antibiotics and the inability of antimicrobial agents to penetrate the biofilm matrix render antibiotic-based treatment methods ineffective against biofilm-related infections. Surfaces patterned with nanoscale topographical features have shown promising results in controlling the attachment of microorganisms. Therefore, nanopatterning of surfaces provides an excellent alternative to the existing antibiotic-based therapies. There are many techniques, such as photolithography and soft lithography, for patterning polymer or metal surfaces. However, depending on the cost, toxicity, feature size, and material compatibility, these methods have limitations. Although hydrogels have garnered special interest as biomaterials due to their biocompatibility and resemblance to the natural biological environment, hydrogels with surface nanopatterns have not been widely investigated as anti-biofouling materials. The applicability of hydrogels in biomedical applications and the importance of inhibiting microbial biofilms underscore the need for further research into the manufacturing of nanoengineered hydrogels with diverse topographical features. In this review, we discuss how nanostructured hydrogels inhibit biofilm formation. Further, we discuss nanopatterning methods, their limitations, advantages, and disadvantages. This article also highlights the current state of research on nanostructured hydrogels and associated challenges.",

    "Abstract": "Cholera outbreaks are prevalent in coastal regions, where hydroclimatic factors play a critical role. However, evidence on their associations with different genotypes remains limited, and global projection remains lacking. We compiled cholera data from EnteroBase and WHO weekly reports covering 110 coastal countries from 1980 to 2022. A generalized additive model was used to examine the associations between hydroclimatic factors and different cholera serotypes and genotypes. We further projected future cholera occurrences for each coastal country under three climate change scenarios from 2025 to 2100. During the study period, Wave 3 of O1 replaced Wave 1 as the predominant genotype of cholera, while cholera O139 remained at low levels and only occurred in Asia. At the country–year level, each 1 °C increase in sea surface temperature (SST) was significantly associated with cholera occurrence (OR: 1.032, 95% CI: 1.023 to 1.040) and Wave 3 of O1 (OR: 1.149, 95% CI: 1.097 to 1.203). Drainage density (m/km2) and coastline ratio (%) were positively related to cholera, with ORs of 1.067 (95% CI: 1.046 to 1.087) and 1.022 (95% CI: 1.019 to 1.027). For future projections, five trend patterns were identified under different emission scenarios, with most countries showing increased cholera risk due to global hydroclimatic changes, peaking under the SSP585 scenario. Our findings reveal associations between hydroclimatic factors and different cholera genotypes and project future cholera risk across coastal countries, thereby providing evidence to inform genotype-specific surveillance and targeted prevention strategies at the global scale.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction. Entering higher education represents a significant and challenging stage, marked by substantial changes that impact students’ well-being, mental health, and academic performance. These challenges can be particularly intensified for lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) students, who are frequently subject to minority stress. In this context, few studies have focused on aspects associated with the well-being of these students. This study aimed to assess well-being, mental health, optimism, motivation, and academic performance according to students’ sexual orientation, as well as the main predictors of well-being in both groups. Method. The sample comprised 285 higher education Portuguese students, of whom 129 were heterosexual and 156 were LGB, aged between 18 and 69 years. Results. The results revealed that the LGB students showed significantly lower levels of optimism, but higher levels of academic performance and mental health, compared to heterosexual students. Among LGB students, optimism stood out as one of the main predictors of well-being, while mental health stood out among heterosexual students. Conclusions. The results highlight the need for more inclusive university environments and psychological interventions focused on promoting optimism to reduce the impact of minority stress and promote the well-being and academic retention of LGB students. More studies are needed that consider the diverse sexual orientations of university students.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: A persistent challenge in adolescent health promotion is insufficient exercise intensity during physical education (PE) lessons, limiting their potential to reduce cardiometabolic risk. National curricula further restrict teacher flexibility in implementing effective preventive strategies. Brief, high-intensity exercise protocols may provide a scalable solution within school systems. Although their general effectiveness is established, less is known about the variability of individual health responses, particularly across multiple outcomes and in relation to sex and intervention type. This study aimed to (1) assess the prevalence of responders (Rs) and non-responders (NRs) by sex and intervention type, (2) examine sex-by-intervention interactions, and (3) evaluate the likelihood of combined positive health responses across body fat percentage (BFP), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), and cardiorespiratory fitness (maximal oxygen consumption [VO2max]). Methods: A total of 145 adolescents (aged 16 years; 48% males) from experimental school-based PE programs were analyzed. Two intervention modalities were implemented: high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and high-intensity plyometric training (HIPT). Rs were identified using typical error (TE) methodology. Statistical analyses included chi-squared tests (χ2), log-linear modeling, and odds ratios (ORs). Results: Chi-squared analyses indicated sex-by-intervention associations in the distribution of responder classifications for body fat percentage (BFP), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and VO2max (χ2 range = 8.26–10.10, p &lt; 0.01). A simple association between intervention type and DBP was also observed (χ2 = 6.49, p = 0.011). However, logistic regression analyses yielded odds ratios with wide 95% confidence intervals crossing the null value for all outcomes, indicating limited precision and the absence of statistically robust interaction effects. Multinomial logistic regression examining combined responses (two or three concurrent improvements) revealed no statistically significant main or interaction effects (all p &gt; 0.05).Conclusions: Brief high-intensity exercise protocols delivered within school-based physical education were associated with favorable changes in adiposity, blood pressure, and cardiorespiratory fitness in a substantial proportion of adolescents. However, sex- and intervention-specific differences in responder classification were not statistically significant and should be interpreted as exploratory. Further adequately powered studies are required to determine whether individual characteristics meaningfully moderate responsiveness to specific high-intensity exercise modalities.",

    "Abstract": "This article provides a comprehensive analysis of long-term changes in the minimum river flow of the southern rivers of Western Kazakhstan (Temir, Oiyil, Zhem) for the period 1940–2022, with an emphasis on summer minimum and winter low flow as key indicators of water and environmental sustainability in conditions of increasing climate variability. The study combines a typology of the climate control mechanisms of minimum flow, analysis of structural homogeneity, and assessment of the internal organization of time series based on ITA and the integral IPTA method, which allow us to reveal the hidden fluctuations and stable phase states of the hydrological regime. The calculation of the climate sensitivity index (CSImin) showed pronounced seasonal asymmetry: summer runoff is largely controlled by atmospheric precipitation, while winter minimum runoff is determined by temperature regime and soil freezing depth. Parametric and nonparametric tests (Pettitt, ADF, SNHT) revealed significant structural shifts in the 1960s–1990s period, corresponding to large-scale climatic anomalies in the region. Summer series are characterized by phases of prolonged low water levels and negative trends in the mid-20th century, while for the winter period, a steady increase in minimum flow has been established, due to regional warming and an increase in the share of underground recharge. IPTA confirmed the presence of long-term phases with high internal heterogeneity in the summer season and a more stable winter runoff structure. The results demonstrate the high climatic sensitivity of minimum runoff and confirm the need to move from static standards to dynamically adaptable methods of water resource assessment. The proposed approach can serve as a tool for developing adaptation strategies, assessing the risk profile of basins, and improving the sustainability of water management planning in arid regions.",

    "Abstract": "Despite significant advances in bank regulation and the widespread adoption of macroprudential frameworks, emerging market economies remain persistently vulnerable to global financial shocks. Episodes such as the Global Financial Crisis, the COVID-19 market turmoil, and recent monetary tightening cycles reveal that financial stress originating in core markets continues to transmit rapidly and forcefully to emerging economies. This paper argues that such vulnerability reflects structural features of contemporary financial systems rather than deficiencies in domestic banking regulation alone. Adopting a conceptual and analytical approach, the article develops an integrated framework of macro-financial blind spots that links global financial cycles, non-bank financial intermediation, and regulatory fragmentation. The analysis highlights how funding liquidity, collateral valuation, margin dynamics, and market-based leverage amplify global shocks through channels that lie largely outside traditional, bank-centric macroprudential frameworks. As market-based finance expands, systemic risk increasingly originates in activities rather than institutions, limiting the effectiveness of entity-based regulation and reinforcing emerging markets’ role as price-takers in global portfolios. The paper contributes to the literature by synthesizing insights from macroprudential policy, market liquidity, and non-bank finance to explain the persistence of emerging market vulnerability in an era of globalized funding. It further derives policy implications for macro-financial governance, emphasizing the need for system-wide, activity-based approaches, improved data and transparency, and stronger domestic and international regulatory coordination. These findings are relevant for policymakers seeking to reconcile financial integration with systemic resilience in emerging markets.",

    "Abstract": "Stem cells can selectively migrate toward cancer cells, and therapeutic genes can be introduced into stem cells. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces apoptosis in cancer cells without harming normal cells. In this study, we evaluated the inhibition of tumor growth in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) using human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) engineered to express cytosine deaminase (CD) and soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL), combined with the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC). An immortalized human ADSC line (hTERT-ADSC) was transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding CD and sTRAIL, generating ADSC.CD.sTRAIL cells. Expression of chemoattractant ligands and receptors was assessed by RT-PCR. The suicide gene effect was evaluated by 5-FC treatment, measuring cell viability and apoptosis markers in vitro. A subcutaneous CRPC mouse model was used for in vivo studies. ADSC.CD.sTRAIL cells showed enhanced migration toward prostate cancer cells. Treatment with 5-FC significantly reduced cell viability, and co-culture with PC3 cells plus 5-FC increased apoptosis marker expression. In vivo, mice treated with ADSC.CD.sTRAIL and 5-FC had significantly smaller tumor volumes than control groups, with no treatment-related toxicity observed. These findings suggest that ADSCs overexpressing CD and sTRAIL, combined with 5-FC, effectively inhibit CRPC tumor growth and represent a promising targeted therapeutic strategy.",

    "Abstract": "Lanthanide ions and their complexes have emerged as versatile tools in biology and medicine owing to their unique photophysical, magnetic, and coordination properties. Their applications span bioimaging, sensing, therapy and diagnostics, underpinned by their strong preference for oxygen-donor ligands, kinetic stability, and tunable luminescence. This review integrates current developments in lanthanide coordination chemistry, focusing on the mechanistic basis of their interactions with biomolecules such as nucleic acids, proteins, and peptides. Moreover, this work highlights the design principles governing complex stability and biological compatibility, summarizing key biomedical uses of lanthanides ranging from imaging and drug delivery to anticancer and antioxidant effects, and discusses their toxicity and biodistribution, and their potential for clinical translation. In particular, this review offers a mechanistically oriented synthesis of recent advances, emphasizing the interplay between coordination behavior and biological function, and identifying emerging trends that define the current landscape of lanthanide-based bioinorganic research. By correlating molecular coordination features with biological performance, the review identifies the main trends shaping lanthanide-based bioinorganic research, also including a brief discussion of complexes formed between lanthanides and naturally occurring molecules, such as amino acids.",

    "Abstract": "KRAS is frequently amplified or overexpressed in ovarian cancer and represents a potential therapeutic target for overcoming chemoresistance. We employed complementary approaches—CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, Tet-ON inducible knockdown, polypurine reverse Hoogsteen hairpin (PPRH) oligonucleotides, and the pan-KRAS inhibitor BI2865—to investigate whether KRAS modulation enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy in ovarian cancer models. CRISPR-mediated KRAS knockdown in SKOV-3 cells dramatically altered three-dimensional spheroid morphology, reducing the average area six-fold, and significantly enhanced sensitivity to both cisplatin and paclitaxel in 3D cultures, where paclitaxel resistance was completely reversed. The Tet-ON system demonstrated dose-dependent chemosensitization with optimal effects at intermediate KRAS knockdown levels (~50–60%). PPRH oligonucleotides at sub-cytotoxic concentrations (50 nM) reduced cisplatin and paclitaxel IC50 values by approximately 50% in 2D cultures. Pharmacological KRAS inhibition with BI2865 produced striking synergy with paclitaxel (several hundred-fold sensitizations in 2D; complete reversal of 3D resistance), and additive effects with cisplatin. In KRAS-amplified Kuramochi cells (representing high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma), BI2865 enhanced paclitaxel efficacy, despite greater baseline chemoresistance. These findings establish KRAS as a promising chemosensitization target in ovarian cancer, with particular potential for taxane-based combination therapies.",

    "Abstract": "Nickel(II) and palladium(II) ions are capable of forming complexes with macrocyclic terapyrrole structures such as the porphyrin or corrin ring. Many different derivatives of these complexes are synthesized and studied because these compounds have potential numerous applications, including catalysis, various light-driven chemical reactions and processes related to intramolecular and intermolecular energy redistribution. Nickel porphyrins exhibit neither fluorescence nor phosphorescence when excited with light; however, palladium porphyrins, when excited to the singlet state, very quickly transform into the triplet state, and unlike nickel porphyrins, deactivation of the excited states occurs by phosphorescence. Palladium corrin has dual luminescent properties and exhibits both a weak fluorescence and strong phosphorescence. These photophysical differences are based on the complex energetic redistribution of singlet and triplet excited states interacting with each other in the intersystem crossing process. Based on the results of calculations at the DFT/TDDFT and CASSCF/NEVPT2 levels of theory, the structure of electronic excited states of model nickel(II) and palladium(II) complexes with corrin and porphyrin macro-rings was characterized and potential paths of photophysical processes leading to the occupancy of low-lying triplet states were described. In nickel complexes, very low-energy triplet states are the main cause of the rapid radiationless deactivation of excited states via triplet photophysical pathways.",

    "Abstract": "In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), altered DNA methylation patterns could be associated with pro-inflammatory, immune, and metabolic risk profiles. Notably, DNA methylation is dynamically regulated by the interplay of multiple factors, including diet, cardiometabolic status, and aging. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the associations between global leukocyte DNA methylation, dietary methyl-donor intake, and cardiometabolic risk in RA and control subjects (CS). A cross-sectional study was conducted with 123 female RA patients classified by the 2010 ACR-EULAR criteria, and 130 female CS. Leukocyte DNA methylation status was assessed with the 5-mC DNA ELISA Kit. RA patients exhibited significantly lower global DNA methylation levels than those with CS. RA status was independently associated with lower DNA methylation levels after adjustment for age and body mass index. Similarly, in both study groups methionine intake showed an independent inverse association with global DNA methylation across adjusted models and lower methylation levels were consistently associated with an unfavorable cardiometabolic profile, characterized by increased adverse adiposity- and lipid-related indexes. In conclusion, RA patients exhibited lower global leukocyte DNA methylation levels compared with CS. In both study groups, lower DNA methylation levels were associated with low methionine intake and an unfavorable cardiometabolic profile.",

A depth-limited expansion strategy generates subgraphs of the network that capture the local structural environment of a seed Act while avoiding the global hub dominance present in whole-corpus analyses. Centrality measures and community detection show how the seed Act’s perceived influence changes with network radius. To incorporate semantic information, we develop and apply an Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted topic modelling method in which representative keywords and LLM-generated summaries form a compact text representation that is converted into a Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF–IDF) document–term matrix. Although demonstrated on New Zealand’s mental health legislation, the framework generalises to any legislative corpus or jurisdiction. Integrating graph-theoretic structure with LLM-assisted semantic modelling provides a scalable approach for analysing legislative systems, identifying domain-specific clusters, and supporting computational studies of legal evolution and policy impact.",

    "Abstract": "Chrysopa pallens Stephens (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) is a key predatory species in cotton agroecosystems. This study investigated the prey-mediated sublethal effects of imidacloprid and nitenpyram at low concentrations (LC20), on C. pallens when exposed via consumption of contaminated prey, assessing impacts on its development and predatory function. C. pallens is a key predatory species in cotton agroecosystems. This study investigated the prey-mediated sublethal effects of imidacloprid and nitenpyram (LC20) on the developmental performance and predatory capacity of C. pallens. Leaf-dipping bioassays were used to assess the toxicity of imidacloprid and nitenpyram to Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae). Age-stage, two-sex life table analysis was conducted to evaluate their subsequent effects on the life history traits and predation performance of C. pallens. Imidacloprid was more toxic to A. gossypii than nitenpyram. Sublethal exposure marginally prolonged larval development, but the effect was not statistically significant. Both insecticides significantly extended the pupal stage, with nitenpyram inducing a greater delay. Imidacloprid markedly increased adult longevity, and both compounds significantly reduced female fecundity. Imidacloprid also suppress predatory behavior more potently, decreasing daily adult consumption and reducing first-instar attack rates by approximately 30%. Although all treatments followed a Holling type II functional response, both insecticides increased handling time and reduced searching efficiency. Overall, imidacloprid primarily inhibited predatory performance, whereas nitenpyram more strongly prolonged development and reduced critical population growth parameters. These findings provide essential evidence for ecological risk assessment and for refining the incorporation of natural enemies into cotton integrated pest management (IPM) strategies.",

While they have been reported to be highly anthropophilic, several studies indicate a broader host range. They also reportedly take multiple blood meals between gonotrophic cycles, which makes determination of host usage difficult when using common blood meal analysis methods. In this study, we examined host usage of Ae. aegypti in Harris County, Texas (Houston), and Maricopa County, Arizona (Phoenix), using a nanopore-based third-generation sequencing protocol to resolve host usage and multiplicity. Using this method, approximately 80% of samples from each location with evidence of blood feeding resulted in blood meal identification, with a single host blood meal identified in about 80% of samples and approximately 20% containing evidence of multiple blood meals. Overall, we observed a wide host range with human DNA being the most prevalent followed by feline (Felis catus) and canine (Canis lupus). We also identified avian, rodent, ungulate and even ectotherm usage by Ae. aegypti from Maricopa County. This study demonstrates the utility of a third-generation sequencing method to identify less common hosts, like ectotherms in Arizona, and to resolve multiple feedings which remain difficult to resolve by current Sanger-based methods.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate and trustworthy forecasting of wind and photovoltaic power generation is essential for the reliable operation and planning of modern power systems. Although recent machine-learning-based forecasting solutions increasingly incorporate elements of trustworthy artificial intelligence, such as explainability, uncertainty quantification, robustness, drift monitoring, and machine learning operations, these components are typically introduced in a fragmented manner and remain weakly integrated at the architectural level, which limits their applicability in real operational environments. This paper presents a systematic review of 59 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2019 and 2025, conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. The review includes studies focused on wind and photovoltaic power forecasting that report system architectures, frameworks, or end-to-end pipelines incorporating at least one trust-related attribute. The literature search was performed using Scopus, IEEE Xplore, MDPI, and ScienceDirect. Using a narrative and architectural synthesis, the review identifies six structural gaps hindering industrial deployment: the absence of semantic data models, shallow model-centric explainability, drift monitoring without governance mechanisms, lack of automated model lifecycle management, insufficient robustness to real-world data defects, and the absence of integrated end-to-end architectures. The evidence base is limited by the heterogeneity of architectural descriptions and the predominantly qualitative nature of reported implementations. Based on these findings, a high-level reference architecture for a trustworthy AI-based forecasting system is proposed. The architecture formalizes trustworthiness as a system-level property and integrates semantic, technological, and functional trust layers within a unified data and model lifecycle, supporting reproducible, interpretable, and operationally reliable forecasting for both wind and photovoltaic power plants.",

    "Abstract": "The main aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a health promotion-based psychoeducational intervention on Health Literacy (HL) and Digital Health Literacy (DHL) levels in older people. This one-group pre–post design study includes a sample of community-dwelling older people, at risk of social isolation, sedentary lifestyles, or physical deterioration. A multidimensional assessment protocol, with specific measures of HL and DHL, was applied before and after the intervention. The psychoeducational intervention includes 20 sessions, conducted by a multidisciplinary team and focused on four core areas (Health Promotion, Interpersonal Relationships and Citizens’ Rights, Health Literacy, and Digital Health Literacy). Non-parametric statistics tests (Wilcoxon signed-rank test) were used, since data did not follow a normal distribution. Seventy-nine older persons participated, with a mean age of 71.7 (SD = 4.6), mostly female (66%) and with basic education (91%). There was a statistically significant increase in the mean total HL score (Z = −3.132; p = 0.002; effect size r = 0.76) and DHL score (Z = −4.735; p &lt; 0.001; effect size r = 0.61) after the intervention, reflecting an improvement in HL and DHL levels. This study showed that this intervention was effective in improving the HL and DHL levels of older adults. These results are particularly noteworthy, considering that HL and DHL are modifiable factors that influence self-management, as well as health outcomes in older adults.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency classifies healthcare workers (HCWs) into five groups based on Mycobacterium tuberculosis exposure risk and potential transmission impact to guide TB screening strategies. However, data on actual exposure frequency and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) incidence across these classifications remain limited. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of HCWs at a tertiary hospital between 2023 and 2024. Baseline LTBI screening was performed for all staff, with annual follow-up testing for Groups 1–4 according to national guidelines. TB exposure history and frequency were investigated and documented by the infection prevention department. LTBI incidence was assessed among HCWs with a negative test in 2023 who underwent repeat testing in 2024. Results: Among 2116 HCWs (27.7% male; mean age, 33 years), TB exposure rates increased with higher risk classification (Group 1: 46.9%, Group 2: 31.3%, Group 3: 18.5%, Group 4: 1.2%, Group 5: 0.6%; p &lt; 0.001), as did the mean number of exposure events per person (1.39, 0.74, 0.31, 0.01, and 0.01, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). The incidence of LTBI was 13/1323 (1.0%). After adjustment, LTBI incidence was associated with ≥2 TB exposure events (adjusted OR, 7.03; 95% CI, 1.87–26.36; p = 0.005), but did not differ significantly by group classification. Conclusions: This study suggests that occupational classification effectively predicts the frequency of TB exposure among healthcare workers. However, LTBI incidence is more closely associated with multiple TB exposure events rather than occupational classification.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or limited lung metastases and compromised lung function, such as those with interstitial lung disease (ILD) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or other factors rendering them high-risk for surgery or medically inoperable, face increased risks of treatment-related toxicity from stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR). This study evaluated a novel treatment approach to mitigate these risks. Methods: We investigated Personalized Ultra-Fractionated Stereotactic Adaptive Radiotherapy (PULSAR), delivered as pulsed radiation every three weeks, in patients with &lt;5 cm lung tumors and ILD, COPD, or prior therapy. Treatment occurred between 2022 and 2024. Online adaptive radiotherapy (o-ART) was employed in 20 patients (80%) to modify treatment plans when anatomical changes warranted replanning. Primary outcomes included volumetric tumor response, changes in dose to organs at risk (OARs) and acute events, while secondary outcomes included local and tumor control, and overall survival. Results: Twenty-three patients received PULSAR treatment at doses between 40 Gy and 60 Gy in 5 fractions and one patient received 54 Gy in 3 fractions, with a median follow-up time of 16.2 months. Approximately half of treated patients demonstrated volumetric tumor response, with median residual volume of 70% (range 36–100%) at maximal response. Among the 20 patients (80%) who underwent online adaptive replanning, significant reductions in OAR dosimetry were observed for all organs assessed including the Dmax for heart (p = 0.0053), bronchus (p = 0.0003), esophagus (p = 0.0005), spinal cord (p = 0.025), and the lung V20 Gy and V12.5 Gy (p &lt; 0.0001). Treatment-related toxicity included two grade 1–2 adverse events and six grade 3 events consisting of pneumonitis, dyspnea or lung infection, with no grade 4 or 5 events. Median progression-free survival was 21.1 months, with 1-year overall survival of 74% and 1-year local control of 100%. Conclusions: PULSAR shows promise as a feasible treatment option for high-risk patients with NSCLC or lung metastases, demonstrating no grade 5 events and complete tumor control. Additional research is needed to fully evaluate the safety profile of PULSAR in the high-risk subgroups and whether PULSAR’s treatment intervals and adaptive planning advantages lead to improved long-term outcomes compared to conventional, uninterrupted SABR regimens.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Peripheral venous cannulation is one of the most frequently performed invasive procedures in adult patients and is often associated with procedural pain. Despite the availability of various pain-reduction strategies, analgesia during cannulation is not consistently implemented in routine clinical practice. The aim of this review was to identify local pharmacological interventions recommended for reducing procedural pain during peripheral venous cannulation, to assess their clinical effectiveness, and to determine which interventions may be feasibly incorporated into everyday clinical practice. Methods: A literature review was conducted including randomized controlled trials, prospective studies, and meta-analyses involving adult patients undergoing peripheral venous cannulation. Outcomes of interest included procedural pain intensity, clinical effectiveness of pharmacological interventions, and their impact on additional outcomes such as patient satisfaction, anxiety, and safety. Results: Peripheral venous cannulation was most commonly associated with moderate-intensity pain. The use of local pharmacological interventions—particularly vapocoolant sprays and topical local anesthetics in cream or patch form—resulted in a significant reduction in pain intensity compared with placebo or no intervention. Several studies also reported improved patient satisfaction and a favorable safety profile of the analyzed interventions. Conclusions: Current evidence indicates that local pharmacological interventions are effective and safe in reducing pain associated with peripheral venous cannulation and may represent a valuable component of patient-centered clinical care. In addition to summarizing clinical effectiveness, this review highlights practical and organizational factors influencing the implementation of pharmacological pain-reducing interventions in routine nursing practice.",

Methods: In this retrospective study, subjects were divided into HM and non-HM groups using an axial length cut-off of 26.0 mm. The main outcome measures were intraocular pressure (IOP), number of glaucoma medications, surgical success rates, and postoperative complications. Surgical success was defined as a decrease in glaucoma medical therapy of ≥1 medication without an increase in IOP, or a postoperative IOP ≤ 21 mmHg with a ≥20% reduction. Changes from baseline were analyzed up to 24 months postoperatively. Results: The non-HM group achieved a significant IOP reduction at all postoperative time points. The HM group showed no significant postoperative IOP reduction except at 3 months. The mean number of medications significantly decreased from baseline to 24 months in two groups. The cumulative surgical success rate at 24 months was 48.6% in the non-HM group, whereas it was significantly lower at 19.4% in the HM group (p = 0.038). No significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complications was observed between the groups. Conclusions: The IOP-lowering efficacy of iStent inject W implantation combined with phacoemulsification appeared limited in eyes with HM. These results may suggest the need for careful patient selection and clinical judgment when considering iStent inject W implantation in this population.",

    "Abstract": "Emerging evidence highlights the critical role of corneal nerves in the pathophysiology of dry eye disease (DED) and other related ocular surface disorders (OSDs). These conditions increasingly demonstrate neuropathic and neurotrophic components, wherein alterations in corneal nerve morphology and function contribute to symptomatology and disease progression. Recent advances in imaging and diagnostic modalities have enabled detailed, in vivo evaluation of corneal nerve architecture and sensory function, offering novel insights into underlying mechanisms and therapeutic responses. This review comprehensively examines current and emerging technologies for corneal nerve assessment, both structural and functional. The structural methods include in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based nerve imaging (e.g., micro-OCT), and emerging technologies like multiphoton microscopy. The functional methods of corneal nerve assessment include advanced esthesiometers, quantitative sensory testing (QST), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The emerging technologies also include AI-driven analytical platforms that can be applied to both structural and functional methods. These various nerve assessment modalities can aid in delineating DED subtypes, selecting targeted treatments, monitoring nerve regeneration, and predicting treatment outcomes. By integrating structural and functional assessments, these technologies are reshaping the diagnosis, phenotyping, and management of DED and other related OSDs, paving the way for personalized therapeutic approaches.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Therapy of osteomyelitis first aims to control infection of the bone and surrounding tissue. Once that is achieved, surgeons are regularly faced with defects of the bone as a result of the infection. Reconstruction of the bone is necessary. In the past years, various bone substitutes were developed. Since 2022, we have used Fiberfill© as a new allogenic material. The aim of this study is to analyze the outcome of patients with chronic osteomyelitis who received bone reconstruction with Fiberfill©. Methods: Patients who suffered from chronic osteomyelitis and received Fiberfill© for bone reconstruction between October 2022 and July 2024 were retrospectively analyzed. Endpoints were infection control, bone healing and function in terms of weight bearing. Data was analyzed descriptively. Results: 38 patients with a mean age of 55.6 years ± 16.4 years standard deviation were analyzed and seen for clinical and radiographic control after surgery with a mean follow up of 60 weeks up to three years. Mean defect size was 2.4 cm. Thirty-four patients (89%) did not have any re-infection. Complications associated with Fiberfill© were not found in any patients. Healing of the bone (completely and partially) was found in 35 patients (92%). Twenty-nine patients (78%) walked fully weight bearing. Seven patients were active with partial weight bearing at time of last follow-up (19%). Conclusions: Fiberfill© can be regarded as a bone substitute for reconstruction of bone defects in therapy of osteomyelitis. We did not find clear disadvantages or a high number of complications after filling up bone defects with Fiberfill©.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: In the Emergency Department (ED), non-critical patients are classified as Triage Level (TL) 3 on arrival if they are assessed as having a high-level of complexity (HLC), or as TL4–5 if they are assessed as having a low-to-mild level of complexity (LLC). These levels are based on the estimated resources needed. This study aimed to identify the characteristics associated with an HLC or LLC by considering a group of variables from the presentation profile (PP) and clinical diagnostic workload (CDW), assessing ex post whether the assignment of complexity levels based on a priori estimation of the number of resources needed can be considered adequate. Materials and Methods: This retrospective multicentre study involved four first-level EDs and included patients between 2023 and 2024. Outcome Measures: The variables tested in a logistic model were those of the PP (age, sex, chief complaint, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and those of the CDW (diagnostic tests, interventions and therapy, assistance, and ED length of stay). Results: Of the 335,507 subjects considered, the average age was 59 years (interquartile range [IQR], 25), with 43.3% of cases classified as TL3. An NRS ≥ 7, ECG, urgent laboratory tests, NEWS &gt; 6, need for a stretcher, and male gender were associated with TL3, whereas obstetric–gynaecological complaints, environmental complaints, skin-presenting complaints, and intramuscular therapy were associated with TL4–5. Conclusions: In non-critical patients a defined group of features were associated with different levels of complexity, going beyond the standard criterion based on the resources needed. These results could help clinicians improve the appropriateness of ED care pathways.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objective: The optimal strategy for hospital transport of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is unclear. A transport protocol based on the shortest travel route was implemented in a metropolitan area in the Republic of Korea to minimize prehospital transport time; however, the protocol is frequently violated. This study evaluated whether protocol violations influenced the clinical outcomes of patients who experienced intra-arrest. Methods: This retrospective observational study included patients who experienced out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and were transported by emergency medical services between September 2021 and December 2022. We analyzed run sheets, the cardiac arrest registry, and Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Surveillance data, which contain patient demographics, time variables, Utstein factors, posthospital arrival treatments, and clinical outcomes. The primary outcome was emergency department mortality. The secondary outcome was poor neurological outcome (cerebral performance category scores 3–5). Logistic regression and mediation analyses assessed associations between protocol violations, transport times, and clinical outcomes. Results: Among the 3474 cardiac arrest cases, 1534 (44.2%) had transport protocol violations. Violations were associated with longer scene and transfer times. The emergency department survival rates for the protocol-violation and -nonviolation groups were 15.4% and 16.4%, respectively. Protocol violations were not associated with mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85–1.27, p = 0.70) or poor neurological outcomes (OR: 1.00; 95% CI 0.45–2.18, p = 0.99). Mediation analysis revealed that increased transfer time did not affect clinical outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Background: Poor clinical control in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is prevalent, yet the interplay of disease severity, modifiable factors, and clinician perception remains poorly understood. This study aimed to determine the frequency of poor control, identify its independent determinants, and characterize the heterogeneity of the poorly controlled population receiving maintenance inhaled therapy with various devices in primary care. Methods: In a multicenter, cross-sectional analysis of 988 patients from the Study SIMPLIFY, clinical control of COPD was classified using the objective RADAR score. We used multivariable logistic regression and Machine Learning (Random Forest with SHAP analysis) to identify determinants of poor control (RADAR ≥ 4) and k-medoids cluster analysis to characterize the poorly controlled subgroup (n = 452). Results: Nearly half the cohort (45.7%, n = 452) had poor clinical control. Agreement between physician-assessed control (five categories) and RADAR classification was 49.3%, with overestimation in 34.0% and underestimation in 16.7% of cases (Cohen’s κ = −0.081; weighted κ = −0.037). The strongest independent determinants were the exacerbator phenotypes (eosinophilic aOR 6.85; non-eosinophilic aOR 4.91). Key modifiable factors included active smoking (aOR 1.92), lower TAI-12 adherence score (per point; aOR 0.96), high dosing frequency (≥4 inhalations/day; aOR 1.54) and high inhaler burden (≥3 devices; aOR 1.84). Machine learning analysis identified clinical phenotype and adherence behavior as the top two scale-independent predictors of poor control. Cluster analysis of the poorly controlled group revealed five reproducible and clinically meaningful phenotypes (C0–C4), primarily separated by treatment complexity, comorbidities, and adherence. Conclusions: Poor clinical control is common and critically under-recognized in primary care patients with COPD on maintenance inhaled therapy. This is driven by a profound clinician perception gap and a failure to address key modifiable determinants, such as high dosing frequency, regimen complexity, and poor adherence, which likely drives therapeutic inertia. Our findings underscore the need to integrate objective tools to unmask poor control and highlight the importance of treatment simplification. The identification of distinct clinical phenotypes provides a roadmap toward a more personalized, evidence-based standard of care.",

Methods: A comprehensive search was undertaken across multiple major bibliographic databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Our outcome assessment measures included postoperative complications such as bleeding, synechia formation, MT lateralization, crustations, CSF leak, orbital injury, middle meatal antrostomy obstruction, frontal recess obstruction, revision surgery rate, smell test scores, and patient-reported outcomes (PROMs). Data were pooled using STATA software as risk ratio, mean difference, or standardized mean difference. Results: Fifteen clinical trials involving 2037 patients were analyzed. Partial MT resection was significantly associated with reduced rates of postoperative synechiae, MT lateralization, middle meatal obstruction, and frontal recess obstruction. Rates of postoperative bleeding, crusting, CSF leak, orbital injury, and revision surgery were comparable between the partial resection and preservation groups. No significant differences were found in olfactory outcomes. While PROMs, nasal obstruction, and headaches improved with partial resection, SNOT scores and nasal discharge remained similar. Conclusions: Partial MT resection demonstrated a safe and effective technique during ESS. Further large-scale RCTs are warranted to confirm and extend these findings.",

    "Abstract": "Hypertension has traditionally been viewed as a hemodynamic disorder leading to cardiac and renal injury; however, growing evidence suggests that, in many individuals, elevated blood pressure is instead the earliest clinical expression of subtle cardiorenal dysfunction. Early abnormalities—such as low-grade albuminuria, increased renal resistive index, arterial stiffness, and masked or nocturnal hypertension—can appear before estimated glomerular filtration rate decline or elevated office blood pressure, indicating early impairment of pressure–natriuresis, heightened tissue renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activity, and increased renal microvascular impedance. The aim of this review is to summarize mechanistic, clinical, and phenotypic evidence supporting the concept that hypertension functions as an early biomarker along the cardiorenal continuum. Incorporating vascular and renal biomarkers, ambulatory blood pressure phenotyping, and targeted laboratory indices into routine assessment may identify individuals transitioning from functional disturbances to structural organ damage. These abnormalities reflect a mechanistic triad of arterial stiffening, salt-sensitive RAAS activation, and circadian blood pressure disruption, collectively defining the early cardiorenal–hypertensive phenotype. Viewing hypertension through a cardiorenal lens underscores a critical opportunity for earlier detection and mechanism-oriented intervention, which may modify disease trajectory and prevent progression to overt chronic kidney disease and heart failure.",

    "Abstract": "White noise has been proposed to enhance cognitive performance in children with ADHD, but findings are inconsistent, and benefits vary across tasks and individuals. Such variability suggests that diagnostic comparisons may overlook meaningful developmental differences. This exploratory study examined whether developmental characteristics and subjective evaluations of auditory and visual white noise predicted performance changes in two eye-movement tasks: Prolonged Fixation (PF) and Memory-Guided Saccades (MGS). Children with varying degrees of ADHD symptoms completed both tasks under noise and no-noise conditions, and noise benefit scores were calculated as the performance difference between conditions. Overall, white-noise effects were small and dependent on noise modality and task. In the PF task, large parent-rated perceptual difficulties and high visual noise discomfort were associated with improved performance under noise. In the MGS task, poor motor skills predicted visual noise benefit, whereas large visual noise discomfort predicted reduced noise benefit. These findings suggest that beneficial effects of white noise are influenced by developmental characteristics and subjective perception in task-dependent ways. The results highlight the need for individualized, transdiagnostic approaches in future noise research and challenge the notion of white noise as categorically beneficial for ADHD.",

    "Abstract": "Polymathy relates to the exceptional learning abilities, in which individuals cultivate and coordinate Breadth, Depth, and integrative capability across multiple domains. It builds on mechanisms typically associated with intelligence, including abstraction, problem solving, and the transfer and integration of information. Because polymathic disposition has partial biological underpinnings, it may intersect with other biologically based individual differences, such as temperament. Biographical accounts also indicate that many polymaths did not achieve exceptional school grades, raising questions about whether the multiplicity of interests in polymaths is associated with distractibility and impulsivity, or whether there is a deeper institutional mismatch between polymaths and educational systems. Our study examined these issues using estimated high school grades across three subject areas, documented university grades, a neurochemistry-validated temperament assessment (Structure of Temperament Questionnaire; STQ-77), the Trait Polymathy Scale (TPS), the Barratt Impulsivity Scales (BIS-11), and information about aptitudes and interests from 296 participants (M/F = 152/144). Contrary to speculation that polymathy reflects distractibility, the TPS correlated negatively with the BIS-11 Lack of Attention scale and positively with the STQ-77 scales of Intellectual Endurance and Probabilistic Processing, confirming high sustained attention in polymaths. TPSs also had selective negative correlations with the STQ-77 Neuroticism scale and positive correlations with the STQ-77 Plasticity, Social Endurance, Sensation Seeking, dispositional Satisfaction scales, as well as several specific and general aptitudes and interests. These findings refine the dispositional profile linked to polymathy, highlighting the differential nature of the three components of polymathy.",

    "Abstract": "The central mechanistic hypothesis underlying multifactorial hearing loss posits that genetic susceptibility and environmental exposures act synergistically to disrupt cochlear homeostasis through redox imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and pro-inflammatory mechanisms. This gene–environment paradigm has significant translational implications: elucidating the molecular crosstalk between genetic variants and environmental factors may enable precision risk stratification and the development of targeted otoprotective strategies. The present review provides a comprehensive examination of the major determinants implicated in hearing loss. The manuscript is organized into six main sections that encompass the most relevant domains of current research. First, it offers (I) an overview of epidemiological patterns and the multifactorial nature of hearing impairment. This is followed by (II) a background synthesis of the complex genetic architecture underlying hearing loss. Next, the authors present (III) an outline of environmental determinants and exposure profiles associated with auditory dysfunction, highlighting prominent pollutant/xenobiotic classes (e.g., organic solvents and volatile aromatic hydrocarbons, heavy metals, pesticides, and especially organophosphates and persistent organochlorine compounds), followed by (IV) an analysis of oxidative stress, mitochondrial impairment, and inflammatory pathways involved in cochlear injury. Subsequently, (V) translational perspectives and integrated therapeutic approaches are discussed, with emphasis on epidemiological prevention and precision-based interventions. Finally, (VI) this review addresses current challenges and future directions in elucidating gene–environment interactions in hearing loss.",

    "Abstract": "There is a growing global demand for cost-effective alternatives to high-priced biologic therapies, which has significantly accelerated the development of biosimilars and positioned them as sustainable and affordable treatment options. Biosimilars include therapeutic products such as monoclonal antibodies, soluble receptors, growth factors, and hormones that demonstrate comparable efficacy, safety, and quality to their reference biologics. By providing lower-cost alternatives, biosimilars play a vital role in bridging the affordability gap and expanding patient access to essential, life-saving treatments, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This review focuses on current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) in biosimilar development, highlighting critical processes such as cell line engineering, glycosylation optimization, and bioprocess refinement aimed at improving cell culture productivity and product yield while ensuring consistent safety, efficacy, and quality across production batches. Advances in biotechnology, especially in proteomics and advanced analytical characterization, have improved understanding of cellular mechanisms influencing product quality and strengthened comparability with reference biologics. These scientific innovations have enhanced regulatory and clinical confidence, supporting wider acceptance and use amongst patients. In addition, this review examines the evolving global regulatory landscape governing biosimilars and its role in reducing development timelines and costs. Together, scientific innovation, standardized manufacturing practices, and harmonized regulatory frameworks foster competition, accelerate market entry, and ultimately help bridge the gap between innovation and affordability, ensuring equitable and sustainable global access to advanced biologic therapies.",

Analyses conducted using Mann–Kendall trend analysis, the Pettitt structural break test, Rolling Window regression, and the Threshold Error Correction Model (Threshold ECM) reveal that certificate prices have systematically decoupled from the underlying asset, creating a persistent premium exceeding 16%. The findings indicate that the risk structure of the certificate has diverged from the underlying asset, the market has become desensitized to high premium levels (asymmetric threshold effect), and prices move independently of fundamental value through a speculative feedback loop (Granger causality). The study argues that the root cause of this anomaly lies in the “Limits to Arbitrage” problem stemming from supply constraints and short-sale bans, offering new evidence on the pricing efficiency of financial innovations in emerging markets.",

    "Abstract": "Rapid urban expansion in tropical coastal cities has intensified vegetation moisture stress, compromising urban resilience and ecological stability. This study investigates the spatial drivers of the Moisture Stress Index (MSI) in Makassar City, Indonesia, by integrating biophysical indicators and land-use characteristics through multi-scale regression analyses. Utilizing dry-season satellite composites (May–August 2025), the research derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI). MSI was modeled using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) across 240 m, 480 m, and 960 m grids. Results indicate that MSI is highly sensitive to urban morphology and land-use configuration. High moisture stress was concentrated in commercial–industrial and dense residential zones characterized by extreme population densities exceeding 28,000 people/km2 and elevated NDBI. In contrast, agricultural zones and open/green spaces provided significant cooling and moisture retention. Comparative performance analysis reveals that the local GWR model significantly outperformed the global OLS model, achieving a substantial reduction in AICc (−10,475.81) and resolving significant spatial autocorrelation to achieve random residuals (z-score = 1.55). The study further confirms that NDBI is the most robust biophysical predictor of MSI. Spatial heterogeneity analysis demonstrated that land-use influences are geographically contingent, with institutional areas showing varied effects based on campus design and canopy presence. These findings emphasize the necessity of scale-aware, climate-adaptive urban planning and demonstrate that GWR provides a high-fidelity tool for identifying neighborhood-level “micro-hotspots” overlooked by global modeling frameworks.",

    "Abstract": "Land-use and land-cover (LULC) change is one of the most pervasive drivers of socioenvironmental transformation worldwide. Given its impacts on ecosystems and climate, the systematic analysis of LULC dynamics remains a central objective of land-change science. Despite major advances in Earth observation capabilities, robust, flexible, and scalable algorithms for long-term monitoring remain unevenly adopted, particularly in remote, forested tropical regions. This study introduces the Multivariate Random Forest Land-Use and Land-Cover (MuRaF-LULC) framework, a supervised and generalizable framework that produces annual, multi-class LULC maps from Landsat time series, with interannual change derived through year-to-year comparisons. A key methodological component of the framework is its predictor-selection strategy, in which variable-importance rankings are used to identify an optimized subset of predictors prior to final model training. MuRaF-LULC was implemented in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and evaluated in Guatemala’s Maya Biosphere Reserve (MBR) for the 2018–2024 period using probability-based sampling and uncertainty-aware accuracy assessment and area estimation. Results show that MuRaF-LULC generates robust annual LULC classifications across multiple years (overall accuracy = 0.90–0.92) and reliable estimates of agropecuario expansion (the dominant transition in the study area) when change is assessed over longer temporal windows where transitions signals stabilize and for which the framework is best suited (producer’s accuracy = 0.97 ± 0.03; user’s accuracy = 0.69 ± 0.05). By prioritizing consistent annual, multiclass LULC trajectories, MuRaF-LULC complements breakpoint- and disturbance-oriented approaches commonly used in land-change studies. Implemented in publicly available, well-documented GEE scripts, MuRaF-LULC facilitates policy-relevant LULC assessment by remote sensing practitioners in governmental and private organizations, where reproducibility, clarity, and ease of deployment are as important as methodological sophistication.",

    "Abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a systemic syndrome capable of inducing remote organ dysfunction. Kidney–lung crosstalk is a form of interorgan communication in acute nephrology, with the heart acting as a pivotal intermediary. Emerging evidence supports the involvement of a gut–lung–kidney axis. Complement activation in these multiorgan crosstalk has emerged as a central amplifier of multiorgan damage. We reviewed the literature on kidney–lung interactions and complement activation in AKI through a bibliographic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Most available data derive from experimental studies or intensive care unit (ICU) populations, often reported in reviews. We further report our real-world experience in a non-ICU nephrology setting, including 186 consecutive patients with AKI. Pulmonary involvement was present at hospital admission in 118 patients (63%). AKI stage 1 was observed in 20/118 patients (17%) with pulmonary involvement compared with 18/68 patients (27%) without pulmonary involvement (p &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, AKI should be regarded as a systemic disease from its earliest stages. Kidney–lung interactions are clinically relevant even in mild AKI and outside critical care settings, underscoring the need for integrated organ assessment in routine nephrology practice. This review integrates complement activation as a central amplifier of kidney–lung crosstalk and multiorgan dysfunction, bridging experimental evidence with real-world observations from a non-critical care AKI population. By focusing on early AKI stages and the timing of pulmonary involvement, we highlight AKI as an active driver of systemic organ interactions rather than a late consequence of critical illness.",

    "Abstract": "Greenhouse gases emitted by humans have exacerbated global climate change. Forests can effectively sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, and afforestation has been widely adopted worldwide to mitigate climate change. Cunninghamia lanceolata and Pinus massoniana, as major afforestation tree species, are extensively cultivated in southern China. However, the mechanisms by which climate, topography, biodiversity, forest structure, and forest growth status affect the productivity of these two species remain unclear. This study used forest inventory data from Lishui City combining the Biomod2 model with a structural equation model (SEM) to investigate the differential effects of biotic and abiotic factors on the productivity of the two tree species. The results showed that at the same diameter at breast height (DBH), the biomass of P. massoniana reached 384.67 kg, accounting for 188.75% of that of C. lanceolata (211.07 kg). The dominant climatic factors affecting C. lanceolata and P. massoniana were different; the most important climatic factors affecting C. lanceolata were Bio 17, Bio 15, Bio 05, Bio 08, and Bio 02, while those affecting P. massoniana were Bio 18, Bio 04, and Bio 01. Furthermore, the explanatory power of the structural equation model (SEM) optimized by the Biomod2 model was effectively improved. Biodiversity and forest growth factors were the most important biotic factors affecting C. lanceolata (p &lt; 0.01), while structural diversity and forest growth factors were the most important biotic factors affecting P. massoniana (p &lt; 0.05). Biodiversity and structural diversity exerted divergent effects on C. lanceolata and P. massoniana in different growth stages, exerting negative effects in the early growth stage and positive effects in the late growth stage. These outcomes were jointly driven by the selection effect and niche complementarity. This study recommends the forest management practices should select tree species based on local conditions.",

    "Abstract": "As human space exploration advances towards establishing sustainable Martian habitats, achieving autonomous food production is a critical requirement. The potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), with its notable environmental resilience and nutritional efficiency, is a prime candidate crop. This study develops a conceptual framework for Martian potato cultivation by systematically analyzing the profound disparities between Martian conditions and plant physiology. We identify and evaluate seven fundamental challenges: atmospheric composition, extreme temperatures, water scarcity, soil properties, nutrient deficiencies, absent microbiota, and radiation/gravity effects. To address these challenges, we propose a phased, testable roadmap comprising four stages: (I) screening and bio-engineering of multi-stress-tolerant potato genotypes; (II) phased domestication via Earth-based analog experiments to define adaptability thresholds; (III) deployment of a controlled cultivation module within a Martian habitat, integrating targeted technological interventions; and (IV) conceptual exploration of extra-habitat agricultural potential. The primary contribution of this work is a structured set of hypotheses and key performance indicators for each stage, translating visionary goals into a defined research agenda to guide future empirical work in extraterrestrial agronomy.",

    "Abstract": "Wear, a critical factor governing the performance and durability of mechanical systems, is typically characterized using point-contact and line-contact test configurations. However, it remains unclear whether the wear trends observed in one test configuration would be observed in the other configuration under the same nominal conditions. In this study, ball-on-disk (ASTM G99) and block-on-ring (ASTM G77) tests were conducted under an identical maximum Hertzian contact stress and sliding speed, using the same material pair and lubricating oil, to clarify which contact configuration exhibits more wear and why. The results show that, under the same Hertzian contact stress, the line-contact configuration exhibits a specific wear rate two orders of magnitude higher than the point-contact configuration, despite exhibiting a lower and more stable coefficient of friction. The disk wear is negligible and the ball shows only mild material loss, whereas the line-contact system displays wear rates several orders of magnitude higher, with the rotating ring contributing the dominant share of the total wear. White-light interferometry and scanning electron microscopy observations reveal directional, groove-dominated surface morphologies on the ball and disk, while wear on the block is confined to edge-localized regions and the worn ring surface has smooth, polished morphology. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirms that a Zn- and P-rich tribofilm forms exclusively on the ring surface. Finite element analysis shows stress amplification at the finite line-contact edges, explaining the observed wear severity. These results demonstrate that matching Hertzian contact stress alone is insufficient to ensure comparable wear behavior between point and line contacts.",

Different surface morphology was obtained for single-shot marking; double-shot marking at angles 0° and 90°; and triple-shot marking at angles 0°, 60°, and 120°. According to the created methodology, dependencies for surface roughness, resulting color, color difference, and chromatic distance from the parameters raster step and scanning speed were established. The resulting colors and color differences for different values of these parameters for the three resulting morphological surfaces were compared. Trends in color saturation changes were established for single-shot, double-shot, and triple-shot color marking, as well as for changes in technological parameters in the studied intervals.",

    "Abstract": "The aging and failure of transformer bushing seals under multi-factor effects are significant causes of oil leakage incidents. However, their failure mechanisms under combined environmental stressors remain inadequately understood. This study presents a comprehensive investigation into the aging behavior and failure mechanisms of nitrile rubber (NBR) and fluoroelastomer (FKM) sealing materials subjected to single and multi-factor aging conditions, including thermo-oxidative, hygrothermal, hygrothermal–compression, and hygrothermal–compression–salt environments. NBR undergoes severe degradation under multi-factors, dominated by additive loss and molecular chain crosslinking. At high temperatures, large-scale molecular chain scission occurs, along with increased compression set, microscopic morphological damage, and filler precipitation. In contrast, FKM exhibits excellent stability thanks to its C-F main chain. Stress synergy significantly accelerates the failure of both materials. These findings highlight the need for multivariate analysis to support reliable condition assessment and lifetime prediction and to inform sealing material selection and proactive grid maintenance.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents an Implicit Neural Representation method for Event-Based Imaging Velocimetry (INR-VG) to reconstruct dense velocity fields from sparse event streams. The core idea is to learn a mapping (multilayer perceptron) from spatial coordinates to flow velocities, v(x)=f(x;θ), which thereby enables dense velocity measurements at any desired spatial resolution. The neural network is optimized through test-time optimization by minimizing the alignment error between warped voxel grids of events. Extensive evaluations on synthetic datasets and real-world flows demonstrate that INR-VG achieves high accuracy (errors as low as 0.05 px/ms) and maintains robustness in challenging conditions where existing methods typically fail, including low event rates and large displacements, significantly outperforming optical-flow-based baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents a successful application of implicit neural representations to event-based imaging velocimetry (EBIV), establishing a new paradigm for dense and robust event-based flow measurement. The implementation and experimental details are publicly available to support reproducibility and future research.",

    "Abstract": "Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has emerged as one of the greatest challenges for the modern public health system and serves as the foundation for the development of advanced stages, such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which may progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MASLD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mutually exacerbate one another. MASLD increases the incidence of T2DM and the risk of complications in patients already affected. T2DM accelerates progression to MASH, which has become the second leading cause of liver transplantation and end-stage liver disease, and is associated with hepatic decompensation, cirrhosis, HCC, chronic kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease. MASLD and MASH are strongly linked to T2DM and obesity, pathogenesis including genetic polymorphisms, environmental factors, and multiple metabolic disturbances: insulin resistance (IR), gut dysbiosis, altered adipokine signaling, such as reduced adiponectin alongside increased pro-inflammatory cytokines. Inflammation plays a central role in the development of HCC in MASH, even in the absence of significant fibrosis. The Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) should be used as a first-line noninvasive tool to assess fibrosis risk. Additionally, ultrasound-based transient elastography (FibroScan) supports clinicians in assessing steatosis and fibrosis severity. Histologically, MASH is characterized by steatosis, lobular inflammatory changes, and ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes, with or without associated fibrosis. Accurately diagnosing and stratifying MASLD based on fibrosis risk is crucial to identify patients who may benefit from pharmacological treatment or can be managed only with lifestyle interventions. Patients should attain above 10% weight loss through lifestyle modifications. Resmetirom is recommended in F2/F3 fibrosis stages. For treating T2DM, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and coagonists, sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, metformin (if glomerular filtration rate exceeds 30 ml/min), and insulin (in decompensated cirrhosis) are preferred. Clinical insights derived from trials are expected to optimize quality of life and long-term outcomes in patients with MASH.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the influence of vanadium–nitrogen (V-N) microalloying design on the microstructure and mechanical properties of 700 MPa grade ultra-high-strength steel bars. Through the control of the V/N ratio and cooling rate, a yield strength exceeding 700 MPa was achieved in a steel with a pearlite–ferrite matrix. Microstructural characterization via optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that a V/N ratio of approximately 1:10 combined with a rolling cooling rate of 1–3 °C/s resulted in the steel bar exhibiting a yield strength of 774.21 MPa and a tensile strength of 971.13 MPa. The primary microstructure of the steel consisted of ferrite and pearlite. The steel featured fine grains and favorable crystallographic orientations, which contributed to its high yield strength and good ductility. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis indicated that under hot-rolling conditions, vanadium precipitated predominantly as nano-scale V(C,N) particles. These precipitates were distributed in both the pearlite and ferrite phases, thereby enhancing the tensile and yield strength. Furthermore, the steel with an optimal nitrogen content (0.0166 wt.%) and the finest grain structure (average grain size ≈ 2.618 μm) showed the lowest stress corrosion cracking (SCC) susceptibility, characterized by an elongation loss rate (Iδ) of 12.51%, demonstrating excellent SCC resistance.",

To address this limitation, we designed a WO3/SiNWs heterojunction-based sensor, fabricated through metal-assisted chemical etching followed by hydrothermal synthesis. Structural and morphological analyses confirm the uniform integration of WO3 nanorods onto SiNWs and the establishment of an effective p–n junction. The optimized sensor exhibits a response of 238 toward 1 ppm NO2 at 127 °C with a response/recovery times of 14.8 s/99.2 s. The improved performance stems from the heterojunction-driven enhancement of charge carrier separation and surface adsorption sites, offering a viable route for developing low-power, high-performance gas sensors.",

    "Abstract": "As integrated circuits face increasingly stringent demands regarding power consumption, area, and stability, integrating novel spintronic devices with computing architectures has become a crucial direction for breaking through traditional computing paradigms. In the paper, switching mechanism of Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) under the synergistic effect of Voltage-Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy (VCMA) and the Spin Hall Effect (SHE) is investigated. VCMA-assisted switching SHE-MTJ device is adopted, and a macrospin approximation model is established based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation to systematically analyze its dynamic characteristics. The research demonstrates that applying VCMA voltage pulses with appropriate amplitude and width can significantly reduce the required spin Hall current density and pulse width for switching, thereby effectively minimizing ohmic losses and Joule heating. Furthermore, by incorporating a thermal fluctuation field, voltage-controlled SHE-MTJ device with stochastic switching behavior can be constructed, obtaining an approximately sigmoidal voltage-probability response curve. This provides an ideal physical foundation for stochastic computing and neuromorphic computing. Based on the above established fundamental discovery, an in-memory computing architecture supporting binarized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is proposed and designed in the paper. Combined with the lightweight network SqueezeNet, this architecture achieves a Top-1 recognition accuracy of 72.49% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a parameter count of only 1.25 × 106. This work offers a feasible spintronic implementation scheme for low-power, high-energy-efficiency edge-side intelligent chips.",

    "Abstract": "Brazil is among the world’s leading exporters of chicken meat, and microbiological evaluation of carcasses is essential to verify process hygiene and safety. This study assessed the microbiological effectiveness and economic impact of two sampling methods for poultry carcasses: the excision of pooled samples of skin and muscle from multiple carcass regions, as recommended by Brazilian authorities, and the excision of neck skin alone. In accordance with Brazilian authorities guidelines requiring carcass evaluation through Enterobacteriaceae counts, these microorganisms were employed to assess contamination across different regions of 90 carcasses. Subsequently, Enterobacteriaceae counts were performed on 144 carcasses using both sampling methods. Mesophilic microorganisms, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus were tested in ten carcasses sampled by both methods to confirm the results obtained from the enumeration of Enterobacteriaceae and results were evaluated using Shapiro–Wilk, Levene, F-test, Kruskal–Wallis, Dunn, and T-test. Additionally, costs related to labor time and protein waste were quantified in 18 slaughterhouses. Results showed that Enterobacteriaceae counts in neck, cloaca, and wing regions were similar but significantly lower than those in pooled dorsal samples (p &lt; 0.05). Neck skin samples were statistically comparable to dorsal pooled samples and exhibited higher contamination than ventral samples, demonstrating equivalent or superior microbiological representativeness. The neck skin method required less time, produced less protein waste, and reduced costs by 99%, indicating a more efficient and cost-effective alternative for microbiological monitoring of poultry carcasses.",

    "Abstract": "Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) is a transboundary bovine viral disease. It has a significant economic impact and is caused by the Lumpy Skin Disease Virus (LSDV). Effective surveillance tools are essential for the early detection of infection, outbreak control, and assessment of vaccination coverage in endemic regions such as India. In this study, an in-house ELISA based on inactivated whole-virus antigen (WVA) was developed, optimized, and validated for the detection of LSDV antibodies in cattle. Its field applicability was assessed through a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey conducted across five Indian states. A local field isolate of LSDV (strain 5-Chitra) was cultured in MDBK cells, inactivated using binary ethylenimine (BEI), and used as the antigen source. The assay was optimized by checkerboard titration and evaluated against the Serum Neutralization Test (SNT). Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) analyses, while cross-reactivity was assessed using sera positive for HS, IBR, BQ, MCF, GTP, SPP, CE, FMD, and Brucellosis. Assay reproducibility was confirmed through inter- and intra-laboratory validation. For the seroprevalence study, 3230 cattle serum samples were collected using a stratified random sampling design across five Indian states, and logistic regression analysis of a subset of 1302 samples was performed to assess the influence of age and sex on LSDV seropositivity. Checkerboard titration identified optimal ELISA conditions at 50 ng of antigen per well, a 1:150 serum dilution, and a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-bovine HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The WVA-ELISA demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance, with 100% sensitivity, 95% specificity, and no cross-reactivity with other ruminant bacterial or viral pathogens, and showed high laboratory reproducibility (κ &gt; 0.96). Seroprevalence ranged from 50.6% to 71.1% across the five states, indicating widespread exposure to LSDV. Risk factor analysis revealed significantly higher odds of seropositivity among calves (≤1 year old) and female cattle, suggesting age- and sex-dependent susceptibility.",

    "Abstract": "Niobium and tantalum are critical metals that are important for technological development. Their main applications are in the production of alloys for the civil construction, electronics, nuclear, and aerospace industries, and in catalysis. Tin reduction slag is a possible secondary source of niobium and tantalum, containing 3.7% and 0.5% of Nb and Ta, respectively. The slag matrix is mainly composed of calcium silicate, a low-reactivity material that prevents contact between the leaching solution and the metals to be extracted; therefore, it is necessary to previously react the material with molten NaOH. This reaction converts calcium silicates into sodium silicates, which are more reactive and water-soluble, and converts the metals into oxyanions, niobates, and tantalates, which are more reactive species. After treatment with molten hydroxide, the material is then solubilized in water; this reaction removes part of the soluble materials and also fragments the silicate matrix. Nb and Ta remain in the solid phase during the water washing step and then undergo acid leaching, where, after the parameters are evaluated, Nb extraction of 96% and Ta leaching of less than 3% are achieved, using a concentration of 10 mol/L H2SO4, a time of 2 h, a temperature of 90 °C, and a liquid–solid ratio of 50.",

    "Abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis involves chronic synovitis and immune-metabolic dysregulation, highlighting a need for multi-target therapies that jointly modulate metabolism and inflammation. We developed glycyrrhiza protein–paeoniflorin self-assembled nanoparticles (GP-PF NPs) and investigated their anti-arthritic mechanism in adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) mice, using UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS-based metabolomics. Male C57BL/6 mice (n = 42) were assigned to the control, model, GP-PF NPs, paeoniflorin, glycyrrhiza protein, physical mixture, and celecoxib groups. All groups except controls received complete Freund’s adjuvant, and treatments were given intraperitoneally for 10 days. GP-PF NPs produced the greatest reduction in paw thickness versus the model (p &lt; 0.0001) and outperformed all other active treatments, which was consistent with the improved histopathology. UHPLC-Orbitrap-MS detected 473 serum metabolites, and the model group showed 59 significant changes versus the control. GP-PF NPs significantly modulated 108 metabolites and yielded robust OPLS-DA separation from the model (R2Y = 0.98; Q2 = 0.742). Venn and pathway analyses identified 43 NP-specific metabolites enriched in glycerophospholipid metabolism, including glycerophosphocholine, 1-oleylglycerophosphocholine, PE (16:0/16:0), phosphocholine, and sphingosine-1-phosphate. These metabolites were selectively normalized toward control levels by GP-PF NPs. qPCR further showed that GP-PF NPs significantly reduced synovial PI3K, AKT, mTOR, NLRP3, Caspase-1, and GSDMD mRNA overexpression (all p &lt; 0.001 vs. model). Correlation analysis indicated significant associations between key serum lipids and synovial genes (e.g., PI3K positively correlated with several metabolites, r = 0.71–0.82; mTOR negatively correlated with sphinganine 1-phosphate and glycerophosphocholine, r = −0.65 and −0.54). These data suggest that GP-PF NPs ameliorate AIA and are associated with the normalization of glycerophospholipid-related metabolic perturbations and reduced synovial mRNA expression of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR-NLRP3 pathway, supporting their potential as a metabolism-inflammation preclinical oriented anti-arthritic nanomedicine.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid expansion of digital education in the 21st century has positioned Virtual Reality Learning Environments (VRLEs) as promising spaces for fostering greater learner autonomy. As immersive technologies become more accessible and pedagogically versatile, they offer students opportunities to regulate their learning processes, experiment in interactive scenarios, and progress at their own pace. This review examines how autonomous learning has been conceptualized and investigated within VRLE research through a comprehensive bibliometric analysis of studies published between 2000 and 2025. The results reveal a research field shaped by two major orientations: one focused on human and pedagogical dimensions (learner diversity, instructional design, and evidence-based strategies) and another on technological innovation (artificial intelligence, machine learning, and simulation-based systems). Topic analyses show that digital and immersive education dominate current scholarly production, while areas directly related to autonomy, personalized learning, and student-centered methodologies remain comparatively less developed. Accordingly, it is crucial to reinforce pedagogical structures that enable autonomous learning in VR environments and to integrate technological advancements in a manner that translates into tangible improvements in educational quality across different settings.",

    "Abstract": "Magnetic topological insulators (TIs) are promising candidates for realizing the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and advancing the development of next-generation low-energy transistors and electronic devices. Doping Bi2Se3 with nano-carbon can introduce magnetic order and open the Dirac gap without introducing extrinsic magnetic impurities. In this work, the C0.06Bi2Se3 single crystal was prepared using the Bridgman method, and their electrical and magnetotransport properties were systematically investigated. Temperature-dependent resistivity and magnetoresistance measurements revealed a magnetic-field-induced metal–insulator-like transition near 152 K. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) detected an energy gap of about 43 meV at the Dirac point, confirming that carbon doping modulates the surface state and opens the gap. Pronounced Shubnikov–de Haas oscillations indicate high carrier mobility in C0.06Bi2Se3. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent Kerr spectra shows that the spin relaxation behavior of C0.06Bi2Se3 differs significantly from that of pure Bi2Se3; the relaxation process of spin electrons from the surface state (τs) dominates the spin dynamics and exhibits distinct trends around 30 K and 150 K due to the interplay of the Dirac gap and impurity-induced states. These results demonstrate the potential of magnetic topological insulator C0.06Bi2Se3 for novel electronic and spintronic applications.",

    "Abstract": "The advent of bilayer silicon carbide as a critical two-dimensional material has opened up a range of potential applications in various fields. The field of nanoelectronics and nanomechanical systems is distinguished by its exceptional mechanical robustness, yet the combined effects of environmental and structural factors on its mechanical integrity remain poorly understood. Molecular dynamics simulations are used in this study to systematically examine the tensile response of bilayer SiC across a range of strain rates, temperatures, vacancy concentrations, and pre-existing crack lengths. Results indicate that mechanical properties converge at a system size of 18,144 atoms, ensuring computational efficiency. Increasing strain rate enhances strength and toughness by suppressing atomic relaxation, while elevated temperature induces thermal softening, reducing failure strain and strength by up to 50% at 900 K. Vacancy defects drastically degrade performance, with 3% concentration causing over 70% toughness loss, and crack propagation follows Griffith-type brittle fracture, where the zigzag direction exhibits superior resistance compared to the armchair orientation. These findings highlight the sensitivity of bilayer SiC to defects and environmental conditions, providing critical insights for designing reliable SiC-based nanodevices.",

    "Abstract": "The overall health impact of alcohol remains controversial. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study made headlines in 2018 by stating that zero alcohol was the safest option. However, its 2022 update introduced age-specific adaptations, asserting that moderate drinking may offer net benefits in some populations. The 2025 U.S. Surgeon General report also discouraged any alcohol intake because of associated cancer risks, but a simultaneous report by the National Academies emphasized tailoring recommendations to individual risks. Mendelian randomization (MR) studies found no health benefits and highlighted increased risks—even at low alcohol doses—challenging dozens of conventional epidemiologic findings in large observational cohorts, some of them of high methodological quality. Given these contradictions, there is a pressing need for large randomized controlled trials in drinkers promoting cessation versus moderation. While small trials have shown some metabolic and cardiovascular benefits of moderate red wine consumption, no large-scale randomized trial has yet assessed hard clinical outcomes comprehensively. Without such evidence, debates will persist. Current guidelines appropriately discourage alcohol in certain populations, but generalizations such as “no safe level of alcohol” might lack sufficient empirical support and perhaps they need a tailored and practical strategy in the context of precision medicine. A balanced, evidence-based approach—free from bias, independent of the industry and grounded in rigorous research—is essential for informed public health policy decisions.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and trauma-related disorders are increasingly recognized as complex conditions involving not only psychological and neurobiological factors but also systemic physiological alterations. Among these, growing evidence points to the crucial role of the gut–brain axis in modulating stress responses, emotional regulation, and neuroinflammation. Objective: This narrative review aims to synthesize the emerging literature on the interactions between the gut microbiota and the central nervous system in PTSD and trauma-related disorders, highlighting potential mechanisms and therapeutic implications. Methods: A comprehensive search of the literature was conducted across PubMed and Scopus and Web of Science as primary bibliographic databases, focusing on clinical, preclinical, and translational studies published in the last two decades. Emphasis was placed on studies exploring the microbiota’s influence on neuroendocrine and immune pathways relevant to trauma, as well as intervention studies targeting the gut–brain axis. Results: Evidence suggests that dysbiosis and gut permeability alterations are associated with PTSD symptomatology, possibly via mechanisms involving hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, neuroinflammation, vagal signaling, and altered neurotransmitter production. Preclinical models support a bidirectional relationship between early-life stress, trauma, and gut microbiota alterations. Furthermore, preliminary clinical data indicate that interventions such as probiotics, diet modulation, and psychobiotics may exert beneficial effects on trauma-related psychopathology. Conclusions: The gut–brain axis represents a promising framework for understanding the pathophysiology of PTSD and related conditions. Although research is still in its early stages, targeting gut microbiota may offer novel preventive and therapeutic strategies. Further longitudinal and mechanistic studies are needed to validate these findings and guide clinical translation.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Eating habits influence cardiometabolic health alongside traditional dietary measures. However, the links between dietary patterns, body composition, and heart-healthy food preferences remain under-explored in large cohorts. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 2461 adults (aged 18 to 75 years) completed an online survey on eating behaviors, food preferences, and lifestyle. Principal component analysis (PCA) of seven behaviors identified dietary profiles. A heart-healthy diet score (range −2 to 10; higher = greater preference for fruit, vegetables, legumes, fish, and less meat/processed meat) was derived from these food preferences. ANOVA and adjusted regressions linked the profiles to BMI, fat mass, waist circumference, and diet score. Results: Four profiles emerged: structured, social, irregular, and disordered eaters. Structured eaters had the lowest BMI (26.8 ± 5.1 kg/m2), lowest fat mass (28.9 ± 9.4%), and highest dietary score (4.73 ± 2.0). Disorganized eaters had the highest BMI (29.0 ± 5.5 kg/m2), the highest fat mass (31.2 ± 8.8%) and the lowest score (3.93 ± 2.0); all p &lt; 0.05. Dose–response analyses confirmed that greater disordered eating (PCA1) was associated with worse outcomes. Conclusions: Dietary profiles are associated with body composition and cardioprotective preferences. Behavioral assessment could refine the identification of cardiometabolic risk and personalize nutrition.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The lack of a short-course of safe and effective macrofilaricidal therapy for lymphatic filariasis (LF) hinders elimination efforts, especially in the endgame scenario. Preclinical studies in mice demonstrated that high-dose rifampicin (RIF) plus albendazole (ALB) produced macrofilaricidal effects within seven days, prompting this randomised, open-label, parallel-group, interventional phase II pilot trial to determine the efficacy of high-dose RIF plus ALB against LF in humans. Methods: In three LF-endemic districts of Ghana’s Upper East Region, circulating filarial antigen (CFA)-positive individuals aged 18 to 55 years identified using the Alere Filariasis Test Strip were enrolled into the study. The participants were randomised through a centralized computer-generated randomisation into four treatment arms. They were treated according to the arm they were assigned to and followed up at 4-, 6-, 12-, and 18-months post-treatment to monitor changes in CFA status and levels, as well as adverse events. Outcome assessors were blinded to minimize assessment bias. Results: A total of 69 eligible participants were randomised into four treatment arms: RIF (35 mg/kg/day) + ALB (400 mg/day) for 7 days (n = 17), RIF (35 mg/kg/day) + ALB (400 mg/day) for 14 days (n = 18), ALB alone for 14 days (n = 17), and an untreated controlled group participating in standard mass drug administration (n = 17). All regimens were well tolerated, with no serious adverse events. Even though CFA positivity declined across all groups, with maximal reductions at 18 months, the RIF + ALB 7-day regimen consistently showed the highest decline, while ALB alone was the least effective. RIF + ALB groups exhibited early antigen decline by 4 months, unlike comparator groups, where reductions occurred from 12 months. Conclusions: These findings suggest macrofilaricidal activity of high-dose RIF plus ALB, supporting further trials in larger, microfilaraemic populations. The trial was registered in the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry on 9 September 2020 under the code PACTR202009704006025.Funding was by the European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership 2 (EDCTP2), with grant code TMA2018SF-2451-ASTAWOL, and by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung-BMBF) under agreement with Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) through agreement number: 81204851.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Adolescence is a critical developmental period during which peer attitudes and school experiences play an important role in social inclusion and academic adjustment. Although attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is common in secondary school populations, adolescents’ own knowledge and attitudes toward ADHD remain underexplored, particularly in non-Anglophone contexts. This study aimed to assess knowledge and attitudes toward ADHD among Greek secondary school students, focusing on awareness of the disorder, perceptions of ADHD-related classroom behaviors, and views on educational support and intervention. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 154 adolescents aged 12–18 years attending Gymnasium (Grades 7–9) and Lyceum (Grades 10–12) in Greece. Data were collected using an anonymous online questionnaire assessing prior awareness of ADHD, perceptions of classroom behaviors associated with ADHD, attitudes toward inclusion and teacher support, and views on educational and therapeutic interventions. Adolescents with and without a self-reported ADHD diagnosis completed different questionnaire sections according to study design. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used for data analysis. Results: Approximately two thirds of participants (66.9%) reported prior awareness of ADHD. Among typically developing adolescents (n = 134), 83.0% recognized distractibility due to external noise, 70.4% noted off-topic interruptions, and 60.0% reported peers getting up without permission. While 75.5% believed students with ADHD can participate in the classroom, 65.9% also reported academic challenges such as incomplete homework or lower performance. Overall, 79.2% of participants stated that school success depends on teacher and specialist support; however, among adolescents with ADHD (n = 20), only 60.0% endorsed this, with 40.0% emphasizing personal effort. Speech-language therapy was viewed as helpful by 55.6% of typically developing adolescents, though 76.9% of adolescents with ADHD reported not receiving such services. Conclusions: Greek adolescents demonstrate moderate awareness of ADHD and generally supportive attitudes toward peers with ADHD, alongside some uncertainty regarding available educational supports. Schools may represent an important context for improving adolescents’ mental health literacy and understanding of ADHD-related support options.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Chronic wounds represent a significant clinical burden and require multimodal treatment strategies targeting inflammation, infection, moisture balance, and tissue remodeling, as defined by the TIME framework. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of innovative hydrogel dressings enriched with fungal biomass, designed to exploit natural bioactive compounds—such as antimicrobial peptides and proteolytic enzymes—to enhance wound healing while maintaining high biocompatibility. Methods: Hydrogel dressings incorporating selected fungal biomasses were fabricated and characterized for physicochemical and biological performance. Key material properties relevant to wound care, including hydrophilicity and porosity, were analyzed to assess exudate management capacity and maintenance of a moist wound environment. Antimicrobial activity was tested against common wound pathogens, and species–pathogen interactions were evaluated using generalized linear modeling. In vitro biocompatibility was assessed using human keratinocytes and compared with conventional silver nanoparticle–based dressings. Results: The developed hydrogels demonstrated properties suitable for clinical application, including superhydrophilicity and high porosity, supporting effective exudate control and moisture retention. Significant broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity was observed, particularly against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with effects dependent on fungal species. Statistical modeling revealed highly significant interactions between fungal species and pathogens in inhibition zones (p &lt; 0.001). Hydrogels containing Pleurotus ostreatus and Agaricus bisporus showed broad activity against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus, whereas Enterococcus faecalis exhibited resistance. Fungal biomass–based dressings displayed superior keratinocyte biocompatibility compared to silver nanoparticle controls. Conclusions: Fungal biomass–reinforced hydrogels offer a promising, safer, multifunctional alternative for infected chronic wound management, supporting both antimicrobial action and tissue regeneration.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic relapsing condition associated with elevated mortality and substantial psychiatric and somatic comorbidity. Oral methadone and sublingual and depot buprenorphine are the undisputed gold standard in opioid agonist treatment (OAT). More recently, another oral buprenorphine formulation, buprenorphine lyophilisate (BUP-Lyo), has been introduced into clinical practice, offering potentially faster bioavailability and simplified administration. This review aims to summarize the available clinical and pharmacological data on BUP-Lyo and assess its potential role within current OAT strategies. Methods: A targeted Medline search was performed to identify publications reporting pharmacological characteristics, safety, efficacy, and clinical use of BUP-Lyo. Additional information was requested from the manufacturer. Relevant sources were reviewed narratively with a focus on OUD treatment, with particular attention to the pharmacological and clinical profile of the compound. Results: Few studies on BUP-Lyo have been published to date. As a rapid-dispersion formulation placed on the tongue, BUP-Lyo provides faster bioavailability and a quicker route of administration compared with conventional sublingual buprenorphine. These properties may reduce the need for post-administration supervision and could lessen risks of misuse or diversion. Available evidence supports its safety, efficacy, and feasibility within routine OAT, and the clinical implications of these characteristics are discussed. Conclusions: BUP-Lyo expands the range of available buprenorphine formulations and offers practical advantages through accelerated absorption and simplified administration. While initial data are encouraging, the limited evidence base underscores the need for further longitudinal and post-marketing studies to define its clinical position in the management of OUD.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Mycotoxin contamination in grain-derived foods is still a major food safety concern; thus, innovative mitigation approaches need to be continuously developed. This study investigated the influence of bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) incorporated into a food matrix on ochratoxin A (OTA)-induced cellular responses using a dietary-relevant in vitro intestinal model. Methods: Four bread types were prepared: control (C), OTA-contaminated (OTA), bilberry-enriched (VM), and OTA + VM (OTA-VM). Simulated intestinal digests of these breads were applied to differentiated Caco-2 cells for 24 h. Apoptotic and necrotic cell populations, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, were quantified by flow cytometry, while RT-qPCR assessed the expression of 10 genes related to mitochondrial function, oxidative stress response, and intestinal barrier integrity. Results: Exposure to OTA resulted in increased cytotoxicity, reflected by a higher proportion of necrotic cells (5.11 ± 0.35%), and elevated ROS levels compared with control cells. Co-exposure to bilberry-enriched digests was associated with attenuation of apoptotic responses, a reduced proportion of necrotic cells (2.16 ± 0.61%) and a 16% decrease in ROS levels. Gene expression profiles in the VM group were comparable to control, whereas OTA exposure led to downregulation of several genes related to oxidative stress response and intestinal barrier integrity (e.g., CLDN2, OCLN, SLC7A11). In the OTA-VM group, a partial recovery of gene expression was observed. Conclusions: These findings suggest that bilberry incorporation into a food matrix may modulate OTA-induced cellular stress responses by attenuating oxidative imbalance and supporting the expression of genes associated with antioxidant defense and epithelial barrier integrity. Bilberries may therefore represent a promising functional ingredient for influencing intestinal cellular responses to dietary mycotoxin exposure.",

    "Abstract": "The growth characteristics and changes in major polyphenol content of the rare plant Persicaria chinensis cultivated under greenhouse conditions were investigated to evaluate its potential for large-scale cultivation and industrial use. The fresh and dry weights of the leaves and stems were measured monthly from May to October, and the corilagin, ellagic acid, geraniin, and neochlorogenic acid contents were analyzed. Leaf fresh and dry weights peaked in June (11.73 ± 4.74 g and 3.02 ± 1.22 g, respectively) and increased again in August thereafter, and subsequently decreased, whereas stem fresh and dry weights continuously increased throughout the cultivation period, reaching 20.06 ± 3.88 g and 7.68 ± 1.55 g, respectively, in October. The polyphenol content in leaves was generally highest in June and then declined. In September, the contents of corilagin and ellagic acid showed marked increases, reaching 10.34 ± 4.13 mg/g and 7.26 ± 3.78 mg/g, respectively. In the stems, the polyphenol content was lower than that in the leaves and showed a decreasing trend after the early cultivation stage. Correlation analysis revealed weak relationships between biomass and polyphenol content in the leaves, whereas strong positive correlations among polyphenols and negative correlations between stem growth and polyphenol content were observed in the stems. These results demonstrate that stable greenhouse cultivation of P. chinensis and the accumulation of functional compounds are feasible and provide fundamental information for the development of cultivation strategies, including appropriate fertilization and environmental management, aimed at functional raw material production.",

    "Abstract": "Thermophilic cyanobacteria are key models for thermotolerance and a promising source of thermophilic bioresources. Yet the subcellular basis of their stress resilience remains poorly resolved. Here, we focus on intracellular polyphosphate (polyP)-rich granules, termed “stabilisomes,” which have been implicated in stress adaptation. The lack of a high-purity, structure-preserving isolation method has been a major technical bottleneck hindering the elucidation of this resilience mechanism. This study describes a robust, structure-preserving purification strategy, boosting the granule-to-protein yield by over 10,000-fold compared with conventional methods. The specificity and structural integrity of this method are supported by the specific enrichment of complex proteomic (937 proteins) and metabolomic (1076 metabolites) signatures. Building on this, subsequent quantitative analysis across cyanobacteria at 7 hot spring sampling sites revealed a conserved core chemical composition dominated by polyphosphate (~21–36%), proteins (~10–20%), amino acids (~7–18%), and lipid components (~12–21%). The variability in abundance across species suggests a dynamic adjustment of these stabilizing components consistent with specific micro-environmental conditions. This work provides a robust bioseparation platform for prokaryotic organelles, offering a critical tool for investigating cyanobacterial resilience and developing novel biomaterials.",

The treatments were arranged in a factorial design, incorporating four nitrogen levels (0, 120, 240, and 360 kg N ha−1) in combination with the presence or absence of a chemical regulator (30% diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate · ethephon), with water serving as the control. Results demonstrated that the integration of 240 kg N ha−1 with chemical regulation significantly enhanced photosynthetic capacity—elevating chlorophyll content (SPAD), net photosynthetic rate (Pn), and activities of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBPCase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase)—while improving canopy structure through increased leaf area index (LAI) and optimized light distribution. This strategy also reinforced lodging resistance by optimizing plant morphology (reducing plant height and center of gravity), strengthening basal internodes (increasing stem diameter, dry weight per unit length, and mechanical strength), and promoting accumulation of stem structural components (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin). Additionally, it facilitated post-anthesis nitrogen translocation to grains and up-regulated key nitrogen metabolism enzymes (glutamate synthetase-GS, glutamate dehydrogenase-GDH, and glutamate-pyruvate transaminase-GPT), thereby boosting nitrogen use efficiency. In contrast, excessive nitrogen (360 kg N ha−1) suppressed these benefits and increased lodging. Consequently, the combined application of 240 kg N ha−1 with chemical regulation achieved the highest yield, proving an effective approach for synergistically enhancing photosynthesis, lodging resistance, and nitrogen utilization in high-density maize systems.",

    "Abstract": "The interfacial behavior of polyelectrolytic flocculants is governed not only by their chemical composition but also by the molecular-scale distribution of charged and neutral segments, which directly influences transport, adsorption, and interfacial stability. In this work, classical molecular dynamics simulations are used to elucidate how charge-site architecture controls the conformation, dynamics, and adsorption stability of anionic polyacrylamides at the quartz–water interface. Polymer architectures ranging from homogeneous charge distributions to block-like arrangements were systematically analyzed at constant molecular weight and global charge density. The results show that increasing charge segregation induces more compact conformations, enhanced translational mobility in solution, and reduced solvent accessibility. At the interface, polymers containing extended neutral blocks exhibit significantly more stable adsorption on quartz than polymers with homogeneously distributed charges, consistent with the low surface charge density of silica. These findings demonstrate that charge-site distribution is an independent and critical design parameter governing polymer–surface interactions. From a chemical engineering perspective, the results provide fundamental insight relevant to the rational design of polymeric additives for solid–liquid separation, flocculation, and sustainable mineral processing applications.",

    "Abstract": "Silver/polyvinyl alcohol (Ag/PVA) nanocomposite films were synthesized via solution casting with varying concentrations of Ag nanoparticles (1–5 wt%). A comprehensive investigation was conducted to understand the influence of Ag content on the structural, optical, mechanical, thermal, electrical, and antibacterial properties of the composites. UV-Vis spectroscopy revealed a red shift in absorption peaks and a reduction in the optical band gap, which decreased from 3.78 eV for pure PVA to 3.37 eV for the 5 wt% Ag composite. FTIR and SEM analyses confirmed successful nanoparticle incorporation and morphological changes. The nanocomposites exhibited enhanced tensile strength, elongation at break, Young’s modulus, and hardness due to strong interfacial interactions. The addition of Ag also increased hydrophobicity and imparted effective antibacterial activity. The electrical and thermal properties showed significant improvement: AC conductivity increased from 5.8 × 10−9 to 1.01 × 10−4 S/cm with Ag content, while the dielectric constant decreased. A high DC conductivity of 1.5 × 105 S/cm was achieved with only 3 wt% Ag. Thermal conductivity also rose from 0.27 W/m·K for pure PVA to 0.92 W/m·K for the 5 wt% composite. These results demonstrate that Ag/PVA nanocomposites are promising multifunctional materials for flexible electronics, combining tunable optoelectronic properties with enhanced mechanical, thermal, and antibacterial performance.",

    "Abstract": "Mechanical recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a key strategy for circular packaging applications; however, repeated thermo-mechanical processing leads to progressive polymer degradation. In this study, the effect of controlled repeated extrusion on the degradation behavior of bottle-grade PET was systematically investigated under laboratory conditions. Mechanical recycling was simulated using a co-rotating twin-screw extruder, where PET was subjected to up to four consecutive processing cycles corresponding to a cumulative residence time of 8 min. Progressive processing resulted in chain scission, reflected by a decrease in intrinsic viscosity from approximately 0.80 to 0.65 dL·g−1 and a corresponding reduction in molecular weight. Melt flow rate increased accordingly, indicating a gradual loss of melt strength. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed that the glass transition and melting temperatures remained nearly unchanged, while the degree of crystallinity increased from approximately 23.0% to 29.5%, accompanied by changes in crystallization behavior. These structural changes led to reduced ductility, with elongation at break decreasing from about 84% to 60%. Optical analysis showed systematic material darkening, and a strong linear correlation between lightness (L*) and intrinsic viscosity was observed. By isolating intrinsic thermo-mechanical degradation effects under controlled processing conditions, this study enables a clearer definition of realistic reuse limits for mechanically recycled bottle-grade PET. The results indicate that bottle-grade PET retains properties compatible with demanding applications only after a limited number of thermo-mechanical processing cycles, whereas further processing restricts its usability to less demanding applications such as fibers, films, and non-food packaging.",

    "Abstract": "To reduce water consumption and potential formation damage associated with conventional water-based fracturing fluids while improving the proppant-carrying and flow adaptability of CO2-based systems without relying on specialized CO2 thickeners, a CO2–water polymer hybrid fracturing fluid was developed using an AM/AA copolymer (poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid), P(AM-co-AA)) as the thickening agent for the aqueous phase. Systematic experimental investigations were conducted under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions. Fluid-loss tests at different CO2 volume fractions show that the CO2–water polymer hybrid fracturing fluid system achieves a favorable balance between low fluid loss and structural continuity within the range of 30–50% CO2, with the most stable fluid-loss behavior observed at 40% CO2. Based on this ratio window, static proppant-carrying experiments indicate controllable settling behavior over a temperature range of 20–80 °C, leading to the selection of 60% polymer-based aqueous phase + 40% CO2 as the optimal mixing ratio. Rheological results demonstrate pronounced shear-thinning behavior across a wide thermo-pressure range, with viscosity decreasing systematically with increasing shear rate and temperature while maintaining continuous and reproducible flow responses. Pipe-flow tests further reveal that flow resistance decreases monotonically with increasing flow velocity and temperature, indicating stable transport characteristics. Phase visualization observations show that the CO2–water polymer hybrid fracturing fluid system exhibits a uniform milky dispersed appearance under moderate temperature or elevated pressure, whereas bubble-dominated structures and spatial phase separation gradually emerge under high-temperature and relatively low-pressure static conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of phase stability to thermo-pressure conditions. True triaxial hydraulic fracturing experiments confirm that the CO2–water polymer hybrid fracturing fluid enables stable fracture initiation and sustained propagation under complex stress conditions. Overall, the results demonstrate that the AM/AA copolymer-based aqueous phase can provide effective viscosity support, proppant-carrying capacity, and flow adaptability for CO2–water polymer hybrid fracturing fluid over a wide thermo-pressure range, confirming the feasibility of this approach without the use of specialized CO2 thickeners.",

    "Abstract": "The cement industry will be officially regulated by China’s national carbon market. Authenticity and accuracy of emission data are prerequisites and the foundation for ensuring the healthy and stable operation of the market. At present, China’s carbon market mainly adopts the Calculation-Based Method (CBM) for data accounting. However, in the cement sector, this method faces challenges due to the inherent complexity of both raw materials and fuels, making it difficult to obtain accurate emission data through CBM alone. Therefore, regulatory authorities are promoting the installation and application of the Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) by enterprises. Pilot studies, however, have revealed considerable discrepancies between the data from the two methods. In this study, a combined data monitoring and accounting method was proposed, in which CBM and CEMS were combined to improve emission data quality. The actual operational and emission data from a case enterprise was taken as an example, and this study conducted systematic analysis and research on data collection and preprocessing, operating condition classification, correlation model construction, and abnormal data diagnosis. The results revealed that this combined method can effectively improve the degree of correlation between CBM and CEMS carbon emissions. Moreover, higher accuracy of abnormal data identification can be achieved through statistical testing. This combined monitoring method not only strengthens data tamper-resistance at the enterprise level but also has the potential to reduce regulatory oversight costs, thereby providing reliable technical support for emission data quality control.",

    "Abstract": "The use of food packaging derived from petroleum-based polymers has developed significant environmental problems, as these materials require centuries to degrade and release hazardous pollutants. Consequently, the food industry is shifting toward biodegradable alternatives developed from agro-industrial by-products, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids. Whey protein is a by-product of the cheese industry, which is emerging as a promising material for producing edible and biodegradable films with effective barrier properties. Whey-based films can be incorporated with bioactive compounds, particularly phenolic compounds. These substances, naturally present in fruits, legumes, and vegetable waste, possess potent antimicrobial and antioxidant activities that are essential for extending the shelf life of perishable foods. This review provides a systematic evaluation of how the incorporation of phenolic compounds influences the physicochemical and bioactive properties of whey-based films. Thus, an analysis of film-forming methods, the interaction between protein matrices and phenolic compounds, and a critical discussion of the challenges remaining for their industrial application as active food packaging were evaluated. The discussion focuses on how the incorporation of phenolic extracts influences the physicochemical, mechanical, and barrier properties of the films, as well as their antioxidant and antimicrobial efficiency. The novelty of this review lies in its comprehensive focus on the sustained release of phenolic compounds from a whey protein film and their application in real food systems. By utilizing these natural additives, the industry can provide sustainable alternatives to synthetic preservatives. Active whey protein packaging represents a viable strategy to inhibit food spoilage, prevent lipid oxidation, and maintain sensory quality, while reducing the environmental problems.",

    "Abstract": "The development of low-permeability reservoirs faces significant challenges, particularly regarding low recovery rates. Conventional water injection is often limited by poor injectivity and low waterflood efficiency. As a key technology to enhance development effectiveness, enhanced water injection requires a systematic investigation into its intrinsic mechanism for improving recovery. This study focuses on a typical low-permeability reservoir. Through laboratory experiments on rock fracturing and spontaneous imbibition, the mechanism by which enhanced water injection increases recovery rates is elucidated. COMSOL Multiphysics is employed to simulate the enhanced water injection process and examine the multi-field coupling patterns during injection. The results indicate that (1) low-permeability rocks in the study area exhibit strong oil–water exchange capabilities driven by capillary forces, with average imbibition capacity ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 g/cm3 and oil displacement efficiency between 20% and 30%; (2) fracturing experiments demonstrate that the injection of low-viscosity fluids at low flow rates (15 mL/min) can induce complex fracture propagation, thereby expanding flow pathways; and (3) the evolution of fluid–solid coupling is jointly governed by injection pressure and damage effects. Specifically, coupling intensity and fracture propagation potential increase with pressure, with optimal injection pressure ranging from 20 to 25 MPa. Rock damage exacerbates the nonlinear response of this coupling. This study combines experimental validation with numerical simulation to provide theoretical support for field practice.",

    "Abstract": "Mining-induced ground fissures in the Ordos Basin pose critical threats to coal mine safety and ecological stability. This study integrated multi-source monitoring data (improves data acquisition efficiency by 60%) with theoretical models to elucidate the dynamic response mechanism between overlying strata failure and ground fissure development. The results demonstrate that: (1) Two rock beam structural models for initial and periodic fracturing of thick, hard rock strata are established, demonstrating that both failure modes are dominated by tensile–shear mechanisms. (2) Ground fissures exhibit distinct zonal characteristics, displaying a gradient pattern of “strong disturbance in the near field and weak response in the far field.” Quantitative data support this pattern: average fissure density is 36/hm2, with a maximum of 45/hm2 recorded in the immediate vicinity of the working face, declining steadily outward. (3) Overlying strata failure forms three distinct zones—caving zone (42 m), fissure zone (158 m), and longitudinal penetrating zone—reflecting the heterogeneous fracture characteristics of medium-hard rock strata under mining influence. (3) The proposed “virtual main arch—virtual auxiliary arch” equivalent support system theory elucidates the mechanistic differences between step fissures (attributed to local support system instability) and collapse fissures (driven by global support system instability) from a mechanical perspective. The developed chain response theory fills a critical theoretical gap and provides a novel method for predicting and preventing geological disasters in mining areas.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines changes associated with a guided introspective intervention in self-reflection, introspection, and motivational competences among future teachers. Conducted within a Master’s course in Teacher Training, the ten-session program employed the “Casa Vital” framework, a metaphorical and visual model representing personal and professional development through structured introspective exercises. Eighty-two participants completed the Self-Reflection and Insight Scale (SRIS-SF) and selected subscales of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) in a pre–post quasi-experimental design. Findings reveal significant increases in introspection, intrinsic goal orientation, control of learning beliefs, and self-efficacy for learning and performance (small–moderate effects), while self-reflection, extrinsic goal orientation and task value remained stable. These results suggest that guided introspection enhances motivational competences by promoting self-awareness, value clarification, and alignment of personal and professional goals. The intervention also seems to support autonomy-oriented engagement and purpose-driven decision-making, contributing to the development of reflective and resilient educators. Integrating structured introspective practices into teacher education may strengthen professional identity, psychological flexibility, and internal-driven motivation. The study underscores the practical potential of reflective frameworks such as Casa Vital to foster meaningful, self-determined, and adaptive teaching practices, offering an accessible and scalable approach for enhancing teacher preparation programs. Within the limits of a single-group pre–post design, these findings provide descriptive, theory-consistent indications that introspection may be associated with the cultivation of purposeful, motivated, and competent educators.",

    "Abstract": "This article examines the conceptual convergence between papal teaching and early Christian democratic political thought on the question of war and peace, focusing on Pope Benedict XV and Luigi Sturzo. While Christian democracy is commonly analyzed through the lens of Catholic social doctrine in areas such as social policy and political organization, its underlying assumptions concerning war, peace and international order remain underexplored. The study reconstructs Benedict XV’s wartime and postwar peace teaching, highlighting his moral critique of war, his emphasis on prevention, and his advocacy of juridical and institutional mechanisms such as arbitration, disarmament, and international cooperation. These positions are then compared with Sturzo’s political and theoretical reflections, which stress the subordination of politics to moral norms, skepticism toward nationalism and statism, and support for supranational institutions as safeguards of peace. The article situates this convergence within the broader historical transformation of the papacy’s relationship to democratic politics, particularly the dismantling of the non expedit principle and the emergence of Italian Christian democracy. It argues that both figures integrate ethical normativity with realism, offering an alternative to power-centered approaches in international relations and anticipating later “just peace” paradigms in Catholic social thought.",

    "Abstract": "Airplanes are the most popular investigation objects as a dynamic and critical component in remote sensing images. Accurately identifying and monitoring airplane behaviors is crucial for effective air traffic management. However, existing methods for interpreting fine-grained airplanes in remote sensing data depend heavily on large annotated datasets, which are both time-consuming and prone to errors due to the detailed nature of labeling individual points. In this paper, we introduce Text2AIRS, a novel method that generates fine-grained and realistic Airplane Images in Remote Sensing from textual descriptions. Text2AIRS significantly simplifies the process of generating diverse aircraft types, requiring limited texts and allowing for extensive variability in the generated images. Specifically, Text2AIRS is the first to incorporate ground sample distance into the text-to-image stable diffusion model, both at the data and feature levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate our Text2AIRS surpasses the state-of-the-art by a large margin on the Fair1M benchmark dataset. Furthermore, utilizing the fine-grained airplane images generated by Text2AIRS, the existing SOTA object detector achieves 6.12% performance improvement, showing the practical impact of our approach.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate crop type mapping remains challenging in regions where persistent cloud cover limits the availability of optical imagery. Multi-temporal dual-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR data offer an all-weather alternative, yet existing approaches often underutilize polarization information and rely on single-scale temporal aggregation. This study proposes PTU-Net, a polarization–temporal U-Net designed specifically for pixel-wise crop segmentation from SAR time series. The model introduces a Polarization Channel Attention module to construct physically meaningful VV/VH combinations and adaptively enhance their contributions. It also incorporates a Multi-Scale Temporal Self-Attention mechanism to model pixel-level backscatter trajectories across multiple spatial resolutions. Using a 12-date Sentinel-1 stack over Kings County, California, and high-quality crop-type reference labels, the model was trained and evaluated under a spatially independent split. Results show that PTU-Net outperforms GRU, ConvLSTM, 3D U-Net, and U-Net–ConvLSTM baselines, achieving the highest overall accuracy and mean IoU among all tested models. Ablation studies confirm that both polarization enhancement and multi-scale temporal modeling contribute substantially to performance gains. These findings demonstrate that integrating polarization-aware feature construction with scale-adaptive temporal reasoning can substantially improve the effectiveness of SAR-based crop mapping, offering a promising direction for operational agricultural monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) aims to identify pixels that significantly differ from the background without prior knowledge. While deep learning-based reconstruction methods have shown promise, they often suffer from limited feature representation, inefficient training cycles, and sensitivity to imbalanced data distributions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel contrastive–transfer-synergized dual-stream transformer for hyperspectral anomaly detection (CTDST-HAD). The framework integrates contrastive learning and transfer learning within a dual-stream architecture, comprising a spatial stream and a spectral stream, which are pre-trained separately and synergistically fine-tuned. Specifically, the spatial stream leverages general visual and hyperspectral-view datasets with adaptive elastic weight consolidation (EWC) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. The spectral stream employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) enhanced with the RossThick–LiSparseR (R-L) physical-kernel-driven model for spectrally realistic data augmentation. During fine-tuning, spatial and spectral features are fused for pixel-level anomaly detection, with focal loss addressing class imbalance. Extensive experiments on nine real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that CTDST-HAD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy and efficiency, particularly in complex backgrounds, while maintaining competitive inference speed.",

    "Abstract": "Remote sensing image captioning (RSIC) aims to generate natural language descriptions for the given remote sensing image, which requires a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of image content and summarizes it with sentences. Most RSIC methods have successful vision feature extraction, but the representation of spatial features or fusion features fails to fully consider cross-modal differences between remote sensing images and texts, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. Thus, we propose a novel cross-modal spatial–semantic alignment (CSSA) framework for an RSIC task, which consists of a multi-branch cross-modal contrastive learning (MCCL) mechanism and a dynamic geometry Transformer (DG-former) module. Specifically, compared to discrete text, remote sensing images present a noisy property, interfering with the extraction of valid vision features. Therefore, we present an MCCL mechanism to learn consistent representation between image and text, achieving cross-modal semantic alignment. In addition, most objects are scattered in remote sensing images and exhibit a sparsity property due to the overhead view. However, the Transformer structure mines the objects’ relationships without considering the geometry information of the objects, leading to suboptimal capture of the spatial structure. To address this, a DG-former is designed to realize spatial alignment by introducing geometry information. We conduct experiments on three publicly available datasets (Sydney-Captions, UCM-Captions and RSICD), and the superior results demonstrate its effectiveness.",

    "Abstract": "High resolution underwater mapping is fundamental to the sustainable development of the blue economy, supporting offshore energy expansion, marine habitat protection, and the monitoring of both living and non-living resources. This work presents a pose-graph SLAM and calibration framework specifically designed for 3D profiling sonars, such as the Coda Octopus Echoscope 3D. The system integrates a probabilistic scan matching method (3DupIC) for direct registration of 3D sonar scans, enabling accurate trajectory and map estimation even under degraded dead reckoning conditions. Unlike other bathymetric SLAM methods that rely on submaps and assume short-term localization accuracy, the proposed approach performs direct scan-to-scan registration, removing this dependency. The factor graph is extended to represent the sonar extrinsic parameters, allowing the sonar-to-body transformation to be refined jointly with trajectory optimization. Experimental validation on a challenging real world dataset demonstrates outstanding localization and mapping performance. The use of refined extrinsic parameters further improves both accuracy and map consistency, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed joint SLAM and calibration approach for robust and consistent underwater mapping.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate recycled manure solids (RMSs) as an alternative to straw as dairy bedding under controlled in vitro conditions using two different conditioners. Pre-cut straw and RMSs were treated once with either 10 wt.% hydrated lime, 200 mL/m2 of an acidic liquid conditioner or left untreated, and incubated for three days at room temperature. Daily, samples were inoculated with manure and Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae. Outcomes were aesculin-positive Streptococcus spp. and coliform counts, pH, and dry matter (DM) content. Hydrated lime reduced all target bacteria by &gt;99% in both materials. The acidic conditioner decreased K. pneumoniae and streptococcal counts by 98.62%/96.6% (straw) and 98.63%/99.58% (RMSs), respectively. It reduced Escherichia (E.) coli counts by ~67% in both materials without statistical significance (p = 0.064). RMSs showed higher bacterial loads and lower DM content than straw but could be substantially improved by lime treatment. As the conditioner were applied following different manufacturer-recommended dosing principles, these findings reflect effectiveness under practical use rather than intrinsic superiority of one conditioner. RMSs might represent an alternative bedding material when managed with appropriate hygienic measures, although straw showed more favorable microbiological and physicochemical aspects. Both materials contained substantial bacterial loads prior to treatment.",

    "Abstract": "This article presents an experimental investigation of the effect of water aging on the static mechanical behavior and damage mechanisms of bio-based sandwich structures with auxetic cores using acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. Both the skins and the core are manufactured by 3D printing using polylactic acid (PLA) reinforced with short flax fibers. Four auxetic core configurations, differing in the number of unit cells across the core width, are considered. The specimens are immersed in water at room temperature to characterize their absorption behavior, which follows a Fickien’s diffusion law model with different saturation levels. Static three-point bending tests are performed at various immersion times to evaluate the influence of moisture on mechanical performance. The results show a progressive degradation of mechanical properties with increasing water exposure time, with the four-cell core configuration exhibiting the highest mechanical performance. Acoustic emission (AE) monitoring is employed to analyze damage evolution as a function of hydrothermal aging. AE parameters such as amplitude, energy, and cumulative event count are used to identify and classify the different damage mechanisms. This approach highlights the effectiveness of acoustic emission for structural health monitoring and for assessing the durability of auxetic core sandwich structures subjected to moisture.",

    "Abstract": "Phishing attacks often rely on impersonating a legitimate entity, such as a well-known company or a bank, with the intent to deceive individuals. A common tactic used by cybercriminals to conduct such an attack is to register a specific domain to host a phishing website on it. In this paper, we propose BadDomains, a system for the early detection of phishing domains’ registration. BadDomains utilizes domain registry data about newly registered domains combined with knowledge about the current phishing situation, such as information about the most frequent impersonation targets, or suspicious domain contact information. An analysis of .pl phishing domain registry data, combined with the authors’ CSIRT operational experience, helped in the design of new features. It also facilitated the extension of features already used in other solutions. The system’s evaluation has been performed using information from .pl Top Level Domain (TLD) registry combined with CERT Polska’s (Polish national CSIRT) public list of phishing domains, used as a ground truth. BadDomains has been compared to a similar detection system designed for .eu TLD called Premadoma, which was adapted to this work. The results showed that BadDomains achieved higher F1 scores than Premadoma. After operational deployment, the system proved to provide timely detections, uncovering unknown phishing domains.",

    "Abstract": "Automated visual inspection of safety-critical metal assemblies such as automotive door lock strikes remains challenging due to their complex three-dimensional geometry, highly reflective surfaces, and scarcity of defect samples. While 3D sensing technologies are often constrained by cost and speed, traditional 2D optical methods struggle with severe imaging artifacts and poor generalization under few-shot conditions. This work constructs a complete system integrating defect imaging, generation, and detection. It proposes an integrated framework through the co-design of an image acquisition system and deep generative models to holistically enhance defect perception capability. First, we develop an imaging system using dome illumination and a small-aperture lens to acquire high-quality images of non-planar metal surfaces. Subsequently, we introduce a dual-stage generation strategy: stage one employs an improved FastGAN with Dynamic Multi-Granularity Fusion Skip-Layer Excitation (DMGF-SLE) and perceptual loss to efficiently generate high-quality local defect patches; stage two utilizes Poisson image editing and an optimized loss function to seamlessly fuse defect patches into specified locations of normal images. This strategy avoids modeling the complete complex background, concentrating computational resources on creating realistic defects. Experiments on a dedicated dataset demonstrate that our method can efficiently generate realistic defect samples under few-shot conditions, achieving 11–24% improvement in Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) scores over baseline models. The generated synthetic data significantly enhances downstream detection performance, increasing YOLOv8’s mAP@50:95 from 50.4% to 60.5%. Beyond proposing individual technical improvements, this research provides a complete, synergistic, and deployable system solution—from physical imaging to algorithmic generation—delivering a computationally efficient and practically viable technical pathway for defect detection in highly reflective, non-planar metal components.",

The energy harvester is an electronic system that converts available ambient energy to electrical energy and regulates its distribution to the output. The aim is to design an energy harvester with the highest integration rate possible with consideration of area requirements and low power consumption. To improve the overall energy conversion of the developed harvester, we implemented several MPPT algorithms (Pilot Cell, Constant Voltage, Perturb and Observe) into a dedicated MPPT controller that controls the DC-DC converter. Consequently, we experimentally analyzed their impact on the harvester system. Findings show that even simple algorithms with smaller chip areas and lower power consumption can achieve results comparable to more complex ones. The proposed, manufactured and experimentally evaluated EH chip prototype has proven its expected functionality and is therefore fully capable of supplying energy for low-power electronics and battery-operated devices.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of phyto-additive mixture supplementation on semen quality and on some reproductive parameters after artificial insemination in rabbits. The trial run 120 days on 20 adult New Zealand white rabbit bucks that were allocated into two different groups, first was control (CON; n = 10) fed with commercial pelleted-feed and second was considered experimental group (EXP; n = 10) which received in feed a natural feed additive mixture (0.1% of dried Chlorella vulgaris powder and 0.1% of dried Laurus nobilis leaves powder). Consequently, the quality assessment of semen by the Computer Assisted Semen Analyzer (CASA) system, samples were instrumentally inseminated on rabbit does for two consecutive reproductive cycles, and productive and reproductive indexes were evaluated. Results demonstrate that while spermatozoa concentration and ejaculate volume did not differ significantly among experimental groups or between reproduction cycles, spermatozoa motility parameters were significantly enhanced in rabbits receiving the phyto-additive mixture, as evidenced by increased total motility (87.83% vs. 70.63%) and progressive motility (75.68% vs. 50.10%) compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.01). No differences were observed in prolificacy traits during the first reproductive cycle, whereas in the second cycle the phyto-additive treatment increased the number of kits born alive per litter (12.29 vs. 10.19; p &lt; 0.05) and improved kit growth performance at birth (79.17 vs. 66.75 g), at weaning (1085.28 vs. 963.15 g), and in average daily gain (28.75 vs. 25.61 g/day). The study provides evidence of alternative practises based on feeding programme to enhance reproductive traits in rabbit production. The goal is to provide farmers with examples of good farming practise (such as precision farming), focused on sustainability and efficiency, and a certain transfer of knowledge.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Velocity-based training (VBT) is used to estimate maximal strength and prescribe resistance-training loads, but evidence in untrained youth, especially early-adolescent females, is limited. In untrained early-adolescent females performing free-weight back squats, (1) the load–velocity relationship (LVR) is comparable to adult samples, albeit with greater between-subject variability, and (2) one-repetition maximum (1RM) estimates are affected by the minimum velocity threshold (MVT) anchor. Methods: Thirty-four untrained females (10–14 years) completed two progressive loading tests followed by actual 1RM attempts. Mean propulsive velocity (MPV) was recorded to model LVRs. Three MVTs were considered: (a) Actual (from Test 1), (b) General (0.30 m·s−1), and (c) Optimal (individualized to minimize prediction error in Test 1). LVR-based 1RM estimates from Multi-point and Two-point approaches were generated in Test 2 using each MVT and compared with the actual 1RM. Results: MPV decreased near-linearly with load (median R2 ≈ 0.996), from 1.00 ± 0.19 m·s−1 at ~40%1RM to 0.30 ± 0.05 m·s−1 at 100%1RM. Across MVTs, Two- and Multi-point models showed similar 1RM accuracy (≤~0.7% difference; p &gt; 0.35). Actual and General MVTs overestimated 1RM (+5.1 kg; p &lt; 0.001), whereas an individualized Optimal MVT (~0.38 m·s−1) removed bias (+0.6 kg; p = 0.52) and reduced error (p ≈ 0.03). Conclusions: In untrained early-adolescent females, the back-squat LVR is highly linear, and 1RM estimation accuracy hinges on the MVT anchor. A streamlined Two-point LVR paired with an individualized Optimal MVT provides an efficient, accurate workflow for youth strength assessment.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Force plate-derived metrics are increasingly used to assess performance and monitor musculoskeletal injury risk, yet the mechanisms linking jump-mechanics patterns to injury risk remain unclear, particularly when using proprietary, algorithmically derived risk scores. Clarifying these relationships is important for improving screening practices, program design, and load management in athletic populations. Methods: A total of 233 collegiate athletes completed countermovement vertical jump (CMVJ) testing on a commercial force plate, which produced 26 force-time variables and proprietary composite metrics. LASSO regression with bootstrapping identified important predictors of CMVJ height and algorithmically derived musculoskeletal injury (AMSKI risk), and Partial Least Squares (PLS) models characterized multivariate patterns across force-time variables. Sex-stratified analyses and post hoc modeling examined potential mechanisms. Results: Greater AMSKI risk was associated with a coordinated pattern of greater concentric output, including greater power, velocity, and impulse, combined with reduced braking capacity. Braking rate of force development (“Load”) showed an inverse association with AMSKI risk across sexes, and females in the elevated-risk category displayed significantly reduced braking values. Postural control measures contributed differently by sex. PLS models indicated that both CMVJ height and AMSKI risk reflected interactions among multiple variables, while proprietary composite scores showed inconsistent alignment with mechanistic predictors. Conclusions: Multivariate force-time profiling offers practical value for identifying athletes whose high-output movement strategies may elevate injury risk when braking control is insufficient. Because proprietary, algorithmically derived risk metrics show inconsistent associations with underlying mechanics, further independent validation is needed before such scores are used in clinical or training decisions.",

    "Abstract": "Soccer is practiced by professionals, amateurs, and recreational players. The physical assessment tools used by professionals are rarely available in recreational settings. Given the widespread participation and potential health benefits of soccer activity, it becomes essential to identify simple and accessible indicators that can help to characterize physical ability in non-professional players. This cross-sectional observational work explores which health status and lifestyle indices can be useful to estimate physical ability in recreational male soccer players when field testing is not feasible. Sixty-six participants volunteered in the study. Five performance field tests were conducted, and a related overall physical ability index (KPItot) was defined, while a questionnaire was developed to investigate nine BIOIndices (BMI, age, physical activity level, job, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, sports career, occurring injuries, medical history). Data for the selected performance tests are reported for the recruited recreational athletes. KPItot was estimated from BIOIndices, using a stepwise backward regression. The selected model, named SOCCERIndex, incorporates six out of nine BIOIndices, excluding smoking habits, sports career, and medical history (R2 = 0.536). In conclusion, with a simple questionnaire, an estimate of soccer players’ physical ability can be obtained. Further data collection is needed to obtain a more generalizable and robust SOCCERIndex.",

    "Abstract": "The high brand premium of geographical indication (GI) tea has not been efficiently converted into widespread economic benefits through its supply chain. The current performance evaluation system is confronted with a dual predicament: first, the strong external environment (such as policy support and industrial agglomeration) interference is hard to isolate, making it impossible to distinguish between “environmental advantages” and “true management levels”; second, the general agricultural indicators fail to capture the output essence of GIs centered on “brand value”. Therefore, this study constructs an evaluation framework integrating methodological and indicator innovations. Methodologically, a three-stage DEA model is adopted to eliminate the influence of exogenous environments and random noises, precisely measuring the “pure management efficiency” of the supply chain. Indicatively, common variables are abandoned, and a customized system is established with logistics facilities, production area, and regional digital investment as inputs, and brand reputation, value, and income as outputs. Based on the panel data of twelve representative tea GIs from 2021 to 2024, the study finds that the following: (1) The “pure management efficiency” of the supply chain is the key factor influencing performance evaluation. (2) “Diseconomies of scale” are the main structural bottleneck restricting performance improvement rather than technological backwardness. (3) Solving the above-mentioned management efficiency problems, especially resolving “diseconomies of scale”, is the micro foundation for achieving sustainable industrial development. This research not only provides methodological support and empirical evidence for the refined management and sustainable development of the geographical indication agricultural product supply chain, but also has significant practical significance for promoting the quality and efficiency improvement of the tea industry and facilitating the sustainable development of related agriculture.",

    "Abstract": "This study demonstrates that high-performance work systems (HPWSs)—encompassing selective staffing, extensive training, performance incentives, and employee participation—significantly enhance the dimensions of psychological empowerment, including meaning, competence, self-determination, and impact, thereby fully mediating a stronger stay intention. Leader–member exchange (LMX) amplifies both HPWS-to-empowerment and empowerment-to-stay intention pathways via dyadic trust, while team–member exchange (TMX) strengthens initial resource uptake. Theoretically, based on social exchange theory, the results enhance relational exchange frameworks by emphasizing LMX’s superior function over TMX in high-contact situations, positioning empowerment as the critical mechanism connecting HRM practices to loyalty in service sectors. The cornerstones of sustainable hospitality development include employee-centric strategies that foster empowerment through value-aligned jobs, certifications that enhance skills, independent guest service decision-making, and feedback loops that transform HPWSs into long-lasting retention engines by integrating TMX peer networks for cooperative support with LMX through individualized coaching and feedback that fosters trust. By reducing attrition, stabilizing talent pipelines, and stimulating service quality innovation, these tactics promote robust operations and sustained competitiveness.",

    "Abstract": "Since 2000, the vegetation cover in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) has significantly increased. However, the responses of carbon and water cycles to large-scale vegetation recovery in the basin and their driving mechanisms remain unclear. This study employs methods such as Sen’s slope trend test, partial correlation analysis, residual analysis, and interpretable machine learning models to investigate the variations in gross primary productivity (GPP), evaporation (ET), and water use efficiency (WUE) in the YRB. It aims to reveal the spatial differentiation mechanisms that drive GPP, ET, and WUE. The results indicate the following: (1) From 2001 to 2020, significant increasing trends were observed in GPP, ET, and WUE across the YRB (p &lt; 0.05), with the most pronounced vegetation recovery observed in the middle reaches. (2) GPP, ET, and WUE are most strongly correlated with the Leaf Area Index, with median values of 0.78, 0.30, and 0.70, respectively. (3) On average, climate change contributes spatially 24.8%, 35.6%, and 24.3% to GPP, ET, and WUE, respectively, while human activities contribute, on average, 75.2%, 64.4%, and 75.7%. (4) Regarding their synergistic evolution, GPP changes predominantly drive WUE changes in the YRB relative to ET. (5) The contributions of NDVI changes to WUE, GPP, and ET changes are 60.4%, 73.1%, and 14.9%, respectively. Overall, NDVI changes dominate the changes in GPP and, by extension, in WUE. This research sheds light on the pathways toward ecological restoration and sustainable development in the YRB.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the traditional food exchange practice carried out between villages in the Aşağıırmaklar basin in the Ardanuç district of Artvin and villages around Ardahan during the autumn months in the context of rural sustainability, alternative economy, and livelihood strategies. The aim of the research is to reveal the structure, functioning, and sustainability of this exchange system, which has not been documented in the literature before, in its socioeconomic, cultural, and managerial dimensions. The barter practice in question involves exchanging fruits such as apples, pears, plums, and mulberries that grow naturally in the Ardanuç region, along with molasses and dried products made from them, for wheat, barley, and various animal products grown in the surrounding villages of Ardahan. The barter process operates without any official institution, written contract, or formal organization, based on reciprocity, trust, and unwritten rules. The research was structured as an interpretive case study within the framework of a qualitative research approach. Data were obtained through semi-structured in-depth interviews and field observations with five individuals actively involved in the barter process. The collected qualitative data were analyzed to reveal the analytical dimensions through which the exchange practice functions as a strategy for life and livelihood. The findings show that food exchange offers an alternative exchange mechanism that reduces food waste in rural areas and utilizes local production surpluses. Furthermore, it was found that the practice is sustained within an informal yet functional coordination structure that adapts to geographical and seasonal conditions, and is transmitted across generations through social relationships based on mutual trust. The study highlights the strategic importance of non-market exchange practices in rural areas in terms of sustainability, local economy, and community resilience.",

    "Abstract": "With the accelerated low-carbon transition of the global energy mix, offshore wind power (OWP) is one of the fastest-growing renewable resources and is often integrated with conventional thermal units into a bundled export transmission system. Under sudden large disturbances, the lack of inertia support makes rotor-angle instability prone to occur, which undermines sustainable operation. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) provide fast emergency power support, and an effective control strategy can enhance transient rotor-angle stability while improving operational sustainability. Accordingly, equivalent-circuit models of the regional export system are established for the before-fault, during-fault, and after-fault stages. Building on the extended equal area criterion (EEAC) and the low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) capability of OWP, the stabilizing mechanism of BESS participation is examined from the perspectives of optimal power and timing, thereby yielding an optimal BESS control strategy for improving transient rotor-angle stability in regional renewable export systems. Finally, a regional renewable export system is implemented in MATLAB/Simulink R2022b, where severe contingencies are imposed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed BESS control strategy.",

    "Abstract": "Xinjiang is an arid and semi-arid region where ecosystems are fragile, and monitoring how its ecology changes over time is critical for its sustainable development. In this study, a Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) was established for Xinjiang from 2000 to 2025. To understand temporal and spatial changes in ecological quality, we conducted spatial autocorrelation analysis, Theil–Sen median trend analysis, a Mann–Kendall trend test, and Hurst exponent analysis. We also used Geodetector to determine which factors affect the RSEI. The main results were as follows: (1) The RSEI in Xinjiang remained low, with a mean value between 0.285 and 0.336. Mountainous areas had higher values, basins had lower values, and spatial clustering was strong (Moran’s I index: 0.81–0.86). (2) H-H clusters expanded and then shrank, while L-L clusters grew after 2015. Areas with excellent ecological grades increased, but so did areas with poor grades, indicating that improvement and degradation both exist. (3) Most areas were stable, but 19.13% showed persistent degradation, indicating that these areas need more attention. (4) Land surface temperature (q = 0.624) and land cover (q = 0.576) were the main driving factors, and factor interactions showed enhanced effects. The results of this study could provide a scientific basis for ecosystem protection and restoration in Xinjiang.",

    "Abstract": "Acute malnutrition affects 3.1% of children under five years of age in Amazonian communities in Peru, where limited access to health services constrains timely nutritional assessment. In this context, this study aimed to develop, implement, and evaluate NutriRadar, a mobile application for automated childhood nutritional classification based on the anthropometric standards of the World Health Organization (WHO). The application was developed using a waterfall software development methodology and implements the calculation of the Weight-for-Height Z-score (WHZ) from basic anthropometric variables (weight, height, age, and sex). NutriRadar was designed with offline functionality, deferred data synchronization, and compatibility with low-end mobile devices to support operational use in Amazonian settings. Field validation was conducted in two early childhood education institutions in Puerto Maldonado, Peru, and included anthropometric assessments of 75 children aged 3–4 years. The application demonstrated stable offline operation, response times suitable for clinical practice, and nutritional classification results equivalent to the WHO Anthro reference tool. NutriRadar represents a viable and reproducible digital automation solution for the operational application of a deterministic WHO anthropometric protocol, contributing to the reduction of operational errors and strengthening standardized nutritional assessment in resource-limited Amazonian contexts.",

    "Abstract": "As organizations strive to balance environmental stewardship with economic competitiveness, understanding the performance implications of Green Innovation (GI) has become increasingly important. Although the nexus between Green Product Innovation (GPI), Green Process Innovation (GPrI), and organizational outcomes has attracted sustained scholarly attention, empirical evidence remains inconclusive. To reconcile these inconsistencies and delineate boundary conditions, this study synthesizes data from 48 empirical investigations (2012–2025) via a random-effects meta-analysis with the Hartung–Knapp adjustment and trim-and-fill procedures to strengthen statistical inference. Results reveal significant small-to-moderate positive associations between GI and environmental (r = 0.172), financial (r = 0.191), and innovation performance (r = 0.143). Notably, moderator analyses demonstrate a synergy premium, where Integrated GI measures significantly outperform isolated GPI or GPrI approaches (r = 0.353). Substantial heterogeneity exists (I2 = 91.2%), which is significantly moderated by innovation type, industry pollution intensity, geographic region, and research design. Our findings reinforce the Natural-Resource-Based View (NRBV) and the Dynamic Capabilities framework, highlighting that strategic returns depend on asset orchestration and contextual factors. We conclude that firms should adopt a holistic approach, integrating both product and process innovations to enhance competitive advantage in an incremental and context-contingent manner, while interpreting innovation-performance results cautiously given the limited evidence base.",

    "Abstract": "In the context of globalization, balancing economic growth with social equity is a critical challenge for achieving sustainable development. While Global Value Chains (GVCs) have become a defining feature of the contemporary economy, their specific impact on the urban–rural income gap—a key indicator of common prosperity—remains under-explored. This study empirically investigates the impact of GVC embedding on urban–rural common prosperity in China using panel data from 30 provinces spanning the period 2011–2022. Adopting a dual perspective of “efficiency” (income growth) and “equity” (income distribution), this study constructs a mediation model to analyze the transmission mechanisms. Research indicates that embedding in global value chains not only enhances the income-generating capacity of urban and rural residents but also effectively narrows the urban–rural income gap. Furthermore, its positive contribution to urban–rural common prosperity is both long-term and sustainable. This effect of GVC embedding on urban–rural common prosperity remains significant after conducting various robustness tests. Mechanism analyses reveal that GVC embedding achieves these outcomes by promoting agricultural industrial upgrading, fostering agricultural technological innovation, and stimulating rural entrepreneurial vitality. Notably, heterogeneity tests indicate that these positive effects are more pronounced in eastern, coastal, and economically developed regions, whereas the impact is less evident in central, western, and inland areas. This study holds important policy implications for promoting the development of China’s open economy to a higher level in the era of economic globalization, as well as for realizing urban–rural common prosperity and balanced, sustainable development.",

    "Abstract": "The dispersion state of molecular catalysts critically determines sulfur utilization efficiency and redox kinetics in lithium–sulfur cells. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) exhibits intrinsic catalytic activity in sulfur redox reactions, owing to its planar π-conjugated framework and highly active Co-N4 centers. However, its poor solubility in solvents confines active sites to particle surfaces, thereby restricting catalytic utilization. The high flexibility of phthalocyanines allows for the introduction of substituents to modulate solubility. This study aims to utilize the differing solubility of sulfonated cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPcS) in various solvents to achieve distinct loading morphologies on carbon host, investigating the structure–activity relationship induced by catalyst dispersion. In the molecular adsorption configuration, the Co-N4 active sites exhibit enhanced accessibility to Li2S4, where the sulfur atoms engage in stronger electron-transfer interactions with the Co centers. This strengthened orbital coupling weakens the bridging S-S bond and facilitates the liquid–solid conversion. Compared to particle-loaded cathodes, molecularly adsorbed cathodes exhibit a charge transfer impedance approximately 84.6% lower and a high reversible capacity of nearly 800 mAh g−1 at a 3C rate. Particularly at a 0.5C rate, they achieve a high initial specific capacity of nearly 1300 mAh g−1 and maintain over 80% capacity retention after 200 cycles. This study demonstrates that molecular-level dispersion, with effective exposure of active sites, is essential for activating the catalytic potential of molecular catalysts and offers a general molecular-engineering strategy for high-performance lithium–sulfur batteries.",

    "Abstract": "Transporting hazardous materials has low accident probabilities but potentially catastrophic consequences, making effective risk management essential in uncertain conditions such as population distribution, weather, traffic, and multimodal scheduling constraints. This study develops a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR)-based optimization model for multimodal hazardous materials transportation that incorporates transportation and transshipment risks, population exposure uncertainty, fixed departure schedules for rail and waterway transport, dual time-window constraints, and limits on the number of transshipments. The model also reflects the decision-maker’s risk aversion and time-varying travel times. To solve this NP-hard problem, an improved chaotic simulated annealing-ant colony optimization (CSAACO) algorithm is proposed. Numerical experiments show that CSAACO outperforms the standard ACO in terms of solution quality and stability. The results demonstrate that the model effectively captures tail risk in dynamic environments and that both the risk aversion coefficient μ and departure time significantly influence route selection. The proposed approach provides an efficient and practical decision-support tool for hazardous materials multimodal transportation planning under uncertainty.",

    "Abstract": "To address the complex influencing factors, divergent stakeholder demands, and the challenge of quantitative comparison in alignment selection for highway expansion and reconstruction, we systematically reviewed the relevant factors. These factors were classified into four categories—economy, technology, safety, and environment—and comprise 16 subfactors in total. The symmetry of the route selection process is disrupted by the varying priorities of different stakeholders, leading to asymmetric evaluations of the alternatives. Using the G30 Lianhuo Expressway Jingqing section expansion and reconstruction project as a case study, we applied the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) combined with expert judgment to derive weights for each factor. The results indicate that environmental factors carry substantial weight, reflecting increased awareness of environmental protection in contemporary projects. We then developed a comparative model based on the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Applying this model to alignment alternatives between the Jingjiadian and Huachacun sections indicates that Option 4 is the preferred alignment. Overall, the AHP–TOPSIS composite evaluation framework effectively integrates expert knowledge with objective quantitative analysis. It enables the scientific ranking of alternatives and provides decision support for alignment selection in mountainous highways and other linear engineering projects.",

    "Abstract": "Procedural approaches have long been used in game development to reduce authoring costs and increase content diversity; however, traditional rule-based systems struggle to scale narrative complexity, whereas recent large language model (LLM)-based methods often produce outputs that are structurally invalid or incompatible with real-time game engines. This gap reflects a fundamental limitation in current practice: generative models lack systematic mechanisms for managing executable game knowledge rather than merely producing free-form narrative texts. To address this issue, we propose a Game Knowledge Management System (G-KMS) that reformulates LLM-based narrative generation as a structured knowledge management process. The proposed framework integrates knowledge grounding, schema-governed generation, normalization-based repair, engine-aligned knowledge admission, and application within a unified pipeline. The system was evaluated on a compact 2D Unity-based RPG benchmark using automated structural and semantic analyses, engine-level playability probes, and a controlled human player study. The experimental results demonstrated high reliability in knowledge admission, stable procedural structures, controlled expressive diversity, and a strong alignment between system-level metrics and player-perceived narrative quality, indicating that LLMs can function as dependable knowledge-construction components when embedded within a governed management pipeline. Beyond the evaluated RPG setting, this study suggests a practical and reproducible approach that may be extended to other executable systems, such as interactive simulations and training environments.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the systemic impact of mobile device usage on sleep health and overall wellbeing through a systems thinking (ST) approach. By employing a systems approach, this study offers a novel contribution to this area by exploring the intricate interdependencies among mobile device usage, sleep hygiene practices (a set of everyday behaviors that promote good sleep health), and related health outcomes. To understand the dynamics and the interdependent nature of sleep, health, and holistic wellbeing, the study examines three interrelated cases: (Case 1) mapping factors that negatively influence sleep and their causal relationships; (Case 2) modeling causal loop diagrams (CLDs) to illustrate the interdependencies among sleep duration, sleep quality, and health outcomes; and (Case 3) modeling CLDs and analyzing the impact of nighttime mobile and electronic device usage on sleep patterns and long-term wellbeing. Rather than presenting empirical data, this paper employs an ST methodology and structurally validated qualitative modeling through CLDs to provide a conceptual framework that complements existing correlational studies and informs future public health research and policy interventions. A significant gap exists in this domain regarding the use of ST tools—such as CLDs—in sleep research to capture the complex, interdependent relationships between sleep health factors and overall health. By focusing on CLDs as one of the ST methods, this paper highlights the dynamic feedback loops through which behavioral, psychological, and environmental factors interact—often negatively reinforced over time by nighttime mobile device usage—to shape sleep quality and overall wellbeing. It underscores the need for novel interdisciplinary strategies and the application of ST to design interventions to mitigate sleep-related health risks and promote digital and holistic wellbeing.",

    "Abstract": "The family Grapsidae is composed of 39 species belonging to seven genera. Currently, larval data are known for 24 out of the 39 species, but the megalopa stage remains unknown for the genera Goniopsis, Grapsus, Leptograpsus, and Planes, although megalopae collected in the plankton have been tentatively attributed to Grapsus and Planes. Thanks to the MALASPINA and MAF research projects, a significant number of megalopae were collected from open-ocean plankton worldwide, and, using DNA barcoding (16S and/or COI genes), a high percentage of them were identified. At the molecular level, Grapsidae have been widely studied, so the availability of barcode sequences in public databases has allowed us to identify the megalopa of Goniopsis pulchra, Grapsus grapsus, Leptograpsus aff. variegatus, Pachygrapsus socius, P. transversus, and Planes minutus. In the present work, these megalopae are described in detail and compared with those previously known. Consequently, for the first time, the morphology of the megalopa stage can be compared across all grapsid genera, and a set of characteristics is defined to identify the grapsid megalopa from the rest of the brachyuran megalopae.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines multi-celebrity deployment as a destination branding practice, using Seoul as an empirical case. The analysis draws on 172 official tourism promotional videos released by the Seoul Tourism Organization between 2011 and 2025, featuring 67 identifiable celebrities and 438 destination references. A qualitative content analysis examines how celebrity endorsement is organized as a branding mechanism, focusing on who appears, what is represented, and how representations are communicated across media formats over time. The findings show that Seoul’s tourism promotion operates through a structured multi-celebrity branding system in which multiple endorsers are coordinated across campaigns and periods. Endorser selection is anchored in Hallyu-affiliated celebrities who function as primary carriers of destination meaning, while emerging, non-Hallyu, and heritage-linked figures occupy complementary roles that broaden representational scope and reduce reliance on individual figures. Celebrity endorsement continues to emphasize major and symbolically dense attractions, while also extending visibility to everyday neighborhoods and locally oriented urban landscapes. Long-term ambassador-led campaigns coexist with travel vlogs and other creative video formats, enabling variation in narrative tone and experiential framing. Theoretically, the study extends celebrity endorsement research by conceptualizing multi-celebrity deployment as a coordinated branding system. Practically, the findings show how destination marketing organizations can mobilize a broad pool of celebrity resources to structure endorsement portfolios over time. Coordinated use of celebrities with different levels of familiarity supports wider spatial representation, enables ongoing narrative renewal, and maintains promotional continuity across changing media environments. This configuration is most applicable to destinations with strong cultural visibility and an established celebrity ecosystem, and may be less transferable to destinations with limited access to influential figures.",

    "Abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) poses an increasing global public health threat, as evidenced by the significant 2025 Foshan outbreak in China. Rapid, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is critical for outbreak response but is challenged by primer mismatches across diverse lineages and a lack of direct sequencing platform comparisons. To address this, we developed a novel lineage-inclusive primer set and performed parallel WGS on 24 clinical samples from the outbreak using both Illumina (NGS) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (TGS) platforms. Our lineage-inclusive primer set successfully amplified full-length CHIKV genomes across all samples. Comparisons revealed that Illumina NGS provided higher raw read accuracy, while Nanopore TGS achieved more complete coverage of terminal UTRs with a faster turnaround time. Crucially, after polishing, variant calls between the two platforms were 100% concordant. Phylogenetic analysis was consistent with a single introduction event, with all outbreak isolates forming a monophyletic clade within the ECSA lineage most closely related to contemporaneous strains from Réunion Island. This study validates a lineage-inclusive amplicon-based sequencing strategy and demonstrates that NGS and TGS offer complementary advantages. When integrated, they provide a robust framework for real-time genomic surveillance, enhancing preparedness and guiding public health interventions against CHIKV.",

A significant amount of particulate matter (PM) is released into the atmosphere during OBB episodes. This study employs the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to detect active fires during daytime and nighttime from OBB in Chiang Mai, Thailand, during March–April 2020, and investigates the mass concentration of size-specific PM down to PM0.1. The results showed that hotspots occur more often at night than during the day. The VIIRS fire detection data provided a better response to small fires and improved mapping of extensive fire perimeters. PM0.5–1.0 showed the highest mass concentration among particle sizes. Moreover, fire hotpots show the highest correlations with PM0.1–0.5 during the daytime and PM0.5–1.0 during the nighttime, and the large OBB in Chiang Mai significantly contributes to ambient PM. Overall, this study offers crucial insights into particulate pollution from biomass burning.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Killed Whole Cell Genome-Reduced Bacteria (KWC/GRB), a versatile vaccine platform, can produce very low cost, thermostable, easily manufactured vaccines expressing complex immunogens that include potent immunomodulators. This system supports iterative optimization through a Design–Build–Test–Learn (DBTL) workflow aimed at enhancing immunogenicity. We applied this approach to developing HIV-1 gp41 Membrane-Proximal External Region (MPER) vaccines using the scaffolded MPER antigen, 3AGJ, a recombinant heterologous protein engineered to mimic MPER structures recognized by broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bNAbs). Methods: Five KWC/GRB vaccines expressing versions of 3AGJ were designed, including versions linked to immunomodulators and multimers of the immunogen. Display on the surface of the bacteria was evaluated by flow cytometry using the broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibody 2F5. Outbred HET3 mice were vaccinated intramuscularly, and MPER-specific antibody responses were assessed by ELISA and by the ability of the vaccines to induce neutralizing antibodies. Neutralization was measured against tier 1 and tier 2 HIV-1 pseudoviruses. Results: All five vaccines were strongly expressed on the bacterial surface and induced clear MPER-specific antibody responses in every mouse. About 33% of the animals showed detectable HIV-1 neutralization. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that a KWC/GRB-based scaffold-MPER (3AGJ) vaccine can elicit HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies in a subset of animals. Although further optimization will be required to improve the consistency and magnitude of neutralizing responses, the findings provide an initial validation of the concept. There are many strategies that can be used to enhance and extend immune responses induced by KWC/GRB vaccines that can be employed to yield improved anti-HIV-1 immune responses.",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of capsaicin (CAP) on lipid metabolism in weaned piglets and its related mechanisms. Twenty-four weaned piglets with an initial body weight of 9.00 ± 0.30 kg were randomly divided into three groups, with eight replicates in each group. The control (CON) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) groups were fed a basal diet, while the LPS and capsaicin group (LCA) received the basal diet supplemented with 4 mg/kg pure capsaicin (delivered via 800 mg/kg additive) for 35 days. About 4 h before sampling, piglets in the LPS and LCA groups were intraperitoneally injected with LPS at a dose of 100 μg/kg body weight, while those in the CON group were intraperitoneally injected with the same dose of normal saline. In this study, we found that the addition of 800 mg/kg CAP to the diet of piglets significantly reduced the accumulation of serum triglyceride (TG), non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), and liver fat, and that CAP up-regulates expression of genes and proteins in the PPARα pathway, consistent with enhanced fatty acid oxidation. The intervention with 4 mg/kg CAP was also found to down-regulate cholesterol synthesis precursors (such as mevalonate, MVA), reduce pro-inflammatory phospholipids (such as phosphatidic acid–phosphatidylcholine, PA–PC), and modulate bile acid metabolism, thereby beneficially regulating blood lipid profiles (TC, TG, LDL-C) and disrupting the “lipid metabolism–inflammation” interaction cycle. Furthermore, CAP promoted fatty acid β-oxidation and bile acid metabolism by activating the TRPV1 channel, which alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation. These findings indicated that CAP has potential application value in improving lipid metabolism, intestinal health, and immune function in weaned piglets. However, its long-term safety and dose-dependent effects require further investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Ice cores retrieved from the Third Pole provide invaluable information about past and present environmental changes. Here we present, for the first time, a continuous tritium and plutonium isotope profile of the Puruogangri ice field, Tibetan Plateau, China, for the last 70 years. The age-depth profile has been composed by different time anchors such as the onset of thermonuclear weapon tests, the so-called bomb peak of tritium, the Chernobyl event, and the time of ice coring. The accumulation rate of ice calculated from the age-depth relation shows a decrease after 1963. It was 57, 15, and 22 cm/year in the periods of 1954–1963, 1963–1986, and 1986–2023, respectively. The concentrations of plutonium isotopes (239Pu: up to 2.7 fg/g) are slightly lower than those of the Belukha ice core, Siberian Altai, Russia, and almost the same as the Miaoergou glacier, eastern Tien Shan, China. Contrary to this latter ice core profile, the Puruogangri plutonium profile reflects that the Chinese weapon test started in 1966. This is confirmed by the tritium time series as well. 240Pu/239Pu atomic ratios vary between 0.14 and 0.23, with an average of 0.177 ± 0.024. The overall obtained local fallout of 239Pu and 240Pu is 13.2 and 9.0 Bq/m2 (4.0 and 1.1 ng/m2), respectively.",

    "Abstract": "Modulated twelve-voltage-vector model predictive current control (MPCC), which applies two or three voltage vectors per control period, exhibits superior steady-state performance compared to modulated six-active-voltage-vector MPCC and conventional MPCC. However, implementing modulated twelve-voltage-vector MPCC requires accurate knowledge of the permanent magnet synchronous motor drive’s inductance and permanent magnet (PM) flux linkage parameters for selecting suboptimal and optimal voltage vectors, as well as computing the duty cycles of optimal vectors. Consequently, its control performance is more sensitive to model parameter inaccuracies. To mitigate parameter sensitivity, a robust modulated twelve-voltage-vector MPCC algorithm based on a model reference adaptive system (MRAS) is proposed. The MRAS-based observer estimates the inductance and PM flux linkage parameters in real time, enhancing model accuracy. The observer is designed with a stability analysis framework, where the proportional and integral gains of the MRAS are theoretically derived to ensure precise parameter estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through simulation results, demonstrating satisfactory control performance even under parameter mismatches. Specifically, the torque ripple is reduced from 1.1 A to 0.6 A, corresponding to a reduction of 45.5%. Similarly, the stator flux ripple decreases from 1.75 A to 1 A (42.9% reduction), while the total harmonic distortion (THD) is reduced from 8.39% to 5.48%, representing a 34.7% improvement.",

    "Abstract": "Climate change is transforming industrial systems globally, both by exposing them to increasing environmental risks and by positioning them as key players in worldwide mitigation and adaptation efforts. This study offers a comprehensive review of how research at the climate–industry interface has developed over the past thirty years. Using a dual-method approach that combines a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with bibliometric analysis, we examine 2458 publications from Scopus and Web of Science and visualize the field’s conceptual structure using the Thematic–Conceptual–Map (TCM) framework. Our results identify five main research themes: (1) integration of adaptation and mitigation; (2) spatial technologies and remote sensing; (3) urban heat and industrial resilience; (4) fundamental adaptation and climate resilience; and (5) connecting vulnerability with adaptive capacity. While mitigation and energy transition are predominant in industry-focused climate research, significantly fewer studies explore how industrial transformation relates to socio-ecological resilience and biodiversity conservation. This gap highlights the need for frameworks that connect decarbonization efforts with ecological preservation. By synthesizing these thematic trends, our study places industrial research at the forefront of shaping low-carbon, climate-resilient futures and offers a valuable knowledge base for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers working to integrate technology, governance, and sustainability within industrial systems.",

    "Abstract": "Cardioembolic stroke remains one of the most severe manifestations of cardiovascular disease, with atrial fibrillation (AF) responsible for a large proportion of ischemic cerebrovascular events. Stroke prevention strategies are currently dominated by oral anticoagulation guided by CHA2DS2-VASc scores, which emphasize age and comorbidities and therefore have limited applicability in younger patients with low conventional risk profiles. Although bleeding risk is routinely assessed using tools such as HAS-BLED, lifelong anticoagulation may still confer a substantial cumulative hemorrhagic burden over decades of treatment. The left atrial appendage (LAA) represents the primary anatomical source of thromboembolism in AF, yet current guidelines largely restrict surgical or percutaneous LAA exclusion to patients with AF who have contraindications to anticoagulation, reflecting a predominantly reactive approach. This Perspective advocates reconsideration of prophylactic surgical LAA exclusion at the time of open mitral valve repair in younger patients. Although early mitral repair limits atrial remodeling, it does not abolish lifetime AF risk, and post-operative or late-onset AF remains frequent. Moreover, residual or recurrent mitral regurgitation promotes progressive atrial dilation and fibrosis, increasing long-term thromboembolic risk even in patients initially in sinus rhythm. By integrating atrial remodeling, LAA morphology and function, residual mitral pathology, and the limitations of lifelong anticoagulation, a selective preventive framework emerges. An anatomical brain-heart prevention strategy may reduce lifetime cerebrovascular risk and improve long-term outcomes. While prospective data are needed, existing evidence supports individualized discussion of prophylactic LAA exclusion during mitral valve repair in selected young patients with structural atrial disease.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, we present the design, fabrication, and study of the optical properties of multilayered metal–dielectric Au/TiO 2 structures. The samples were fabricated using Joule effect evaporation for gold and electron beam evaporation for titanium dioxide. Their structure was designed to have an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) point at different wavelengths around 800 nm, in order to study their nonlinear response as a function of the resonance conditions around the ENZ point. The characterization of the linear properties of the samples was done using spectrophotometry and spectral ellipsometry. We studied the nonlinear response with the z-scan technique at different incident irradiances using a Ti:sapphire femtosecond laser, enabling us to characterize both the refractive and absorptive contributions to the nonlinear response. Due to the high pulse repetition rate inherent to Ti:sapphire systems and the presence of linear absorption in the samples, cumulative pulse-to-pulse thermal effects may be present. A modified version of the z-scan technique that allowed us to separate the electronic from the thermal contribution was used. A clear enhancement of the nonlinear response was observed for the sample with an ENZ point around the laser wavelength 800 nm with a nonlinear refractive index of n 2 = 0.103 ± 0.006 cm 2 ·GW −1 , a value that is comparable to other ENZ materials in literature.",

Abundances for 27 elements, ranging from carbon to dysprosium, were derived. Our results support the original classification that Turranburra, with a low average metallicity of [Fe/H] = −2.45 ± 0.07, likely originates from a dwarf galaxy progenitor. Willka Yaku has a low average metallicity of [Fe/H] = −2.35 ± 0.03 with a small scatter in the abundances, consistent with a globular cluster progenitor as suggested by previous studies. Both streams exhibit mild enhancements in neutron-capture elements, with averages of [Eu II /Fe] = 0.47 ± 0.09 for Turranburra and 0.44 ± 0.05 for Willka Yaku, consistent with enrichment from an r -process event. A similar enrichment is observed in other stellar streams, and we further discuss this signature as it relates to the potential enrichment histories of these two streams.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Recent observations suggest that planetary engulfment by a giant star may produce radiation that resembles subluminous red novae. We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of the interaction between an eccentric 5 M J giant planet and its 1 M ⊙ red-giant host star. The planet’s pericenter is initially 60% of the stellar radius and is fully engulfed after tens of orbits. Once inside the stellar envelope, the planet generates pressure disturbances that steepen into shocks, ejecting material from the envelope. We use post-processing to calculate the light curves produced by planetary engulfment. We find that the hot stellar ejecta enhance the stellar luminosity by several orders of magnitude. A prolonged hydrogen recombination plateau appears when the ejecta cool to about 10 4 K. The late-time rapid dimming of the light curve follows dust formation, which obscures the radiation. For planets with lower eccentricity, the orbital decay proceeds more slowly, although the observable properties remain similar.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Growing evidence indicates that some fast radio bursts (FRBs) reside in dense, magnetoionic environments where extrinsic propagation effects can substantially reshape the observed signal. Within a 1D Gaussian plasma-lens framework, we show that small, monotonic variations in the incidence angle of the FRB wavefront naturally generate both downward and upward sub-burst frequency drifts. We further demonstrate that distinct lensed paths that probe different rotation measures (RMs) can produce orthogonal polarization-angle (PA) jumps at gigahertz frequencies. In this picture, a ∼90° PA transition requires only a modest RM contrast of order a few ×10 rad m −2 between the multiple images. The chromatic activity of FRB 20180916B—earlier and narrower activity windows at higher frequencies—can be explained as preferential magnification near the outer caustic. Finally, the intrinsic resolution of a plasma lens provides an upper limit on the transverse emission size: lenses located close to the source yield magnetospheric-scale constraints and offer a practical means of discriminating between inner- and outer-magnetospheric emission scenarios. These results suggest that plasma lensing could account for multiple complex observational features of FRBs and may play a nonnegligible role in modulating their observable properties.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Flares are usually observed during the afterglow phases of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the soft-X-ray, optical, and radio bands—but rarely in the gamma-ray band. Despite its extraordinary brightness, GECAM-C has accurately measured both the bright prompt emission and flare emission of GRB 221009A without instrumental effects, offering a good opportunity to study the relation between them. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the flare emission of GRB 221009A, which is composed of a series of flares. Among them, we identify an exceptionally bright flare with a record-breaking isotropic energy E iso = 1.82 × 10 53 erg for GRB flares. It exhibits the highest peak energy ever detected in GRB flares, E peak ∼ 300 keV, making it a genuine gamma-ray flare. It also shows rapid rise and decay timescales, significantly shorter than those of typical X-ray flares observed in the soft-X-ray or optical bands but comparable to those observed in prompt emissions. Despite these exceptional properties, the flare shares several common properties with typical GRB flares. We note that this is the first observation of a GRB flare in the keV–MeV band with sufficiently high temporal resolution and high statistics, bridging the last gap between the prompt emission and flare.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We present the first targeted searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) from 114 active galactic nuclei that may host supermassive black hole binaries, using the NANOGrav 15 yr dataset. By incorporating electromagnetic priors on sky location, distance, redshift, and CW frequency, our strain and chirp-mass upper limits are typically improved by a factor of ∼2 (median 2.2) relative to all-sky limits at the same frequency. Bayesian comparisons against a model including only a Hellings–Downs-correlated background disfavors a CW signal for all targets, with a mean Bayes factor of 0.73 ± 0.32. Two targets have Bayes factors slightly above unity, but coherence tests, random-targeting experiments, and a conservative accounting of the 114-target trials factor all indicate that they are consistent with noise. We use these two candidates as worked examples to illustrate an end-to-end targeted CW search analysis and a suite of follow-up tests that future promising candidates would need to pass. We find that the electromagnetic interpretations of both candidates are ambiguous, and we update the constraints on a putative binary in 3C 66B, ruling out part of its previously allowed parameter space. Ultimately, our results demonstrate the current sensitivity of targeted pulsar timing array searches for CWs and define a road map for future multimessenger CW detections.",

    "Abstract": "Semi-aquatic bug (Hemiptera, Heteroptera, Gerromorpha) constitute a monophyletic group of predatory insects that play crucial roles in limnic environments. The Oriental and Neotropical regions harbor the richest faunas, but many species from these areas remain undescribed, and large regions are still poorly explored. In Brazil, semi-aquatic bugs have been more thoroughly sampled in the North and Southeast regions, while other regions have been neglected. The Southern Region of the country comprises the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina, and Rio Grande do Sul, from which 20, 44, and 28 species of Gerromorpha have been recorded, respectively. In total, 61 species are known from the region, which is likely far from being an accurate representation of the local fauna. Here, we present new state records of 24 species of Gerromorpha from the State of Paraná, nine from Santa Catarina and six from Rio Grande do Sul. Furthermore, of the 45 species that we studied, 36 are recorded for the first time from at least one of the three States. Our results also include one first record from Brazil and 14 from the South Region. Additionally, we identified and provide illustrations of a male of Mesovelia amoena Uhler, 1894, which is extremely rare in the Neotropics. Finally, the new data presented here increases the number of semi-aquatic bug species known from the South Region from 60 to 75.",

    "Abstract": "Neuroinflammation, an immune process in the central nervous system (CNS), is a key contributor to a range of neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders (<i>e.g.</i>, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease), stroke, and depression, underscoring its significant pathological relevance. While maackiain (MAA) exhibits potent anti-inflammatory activity, its potential to mitigate neuroinflammation remains poorly understood. This study investigated the therapeutic effects of MAA on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation and its underlying mechanisms. <i>In vitro</i>, MAA significantly improved BV2 cell viability and reduced nitric oxide (NO) expression in LPS-treated cells, decreased the expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and it also inhibited the accumulation of Ferrous ion (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) and lipid peroxides as well as the damage to mitochondria. Higher concentrations of MAA were more effective, consistent with subsequent animal experiments. <i>In vivo</i>, mice treated with MAA showed improved memory in the Morris water maze compared to the LPS group. Nissl staining revealed fewer IBA-1 positive cells and a decrease in COX-2 and IL-6 levels in the hippocampus and cortex. This compound also increased the number of normal neurons in the cortex and CA3 region. The results of this study highlight the inhibitory effects of MAA on neuroinflammation, suggesting its potential as an effective therapeutic agent for treating neuroinflammation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a critical challenge in global health, with a particularly severe impact in developing countries. The increasing resistance among bacterial pathogens complicates empirical therapy, especially in tertiary care settings. This study analyzed antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of bacterial isolates from a private tertiary care hospital in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir. Materials and Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted from June 2023 to December 2024. A total of 2101 clinical specimens were collected from outpatient department (OPD), inpatient department (IPD), and intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Bacterial identification was performed using the Vitek 2 system, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing followed Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Results: Of the 410 clinically significant isolates, Escherichia coli was the most prevalent, particularly in OPD samples. High methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin resistance in enterococci were noted, especially in ICU settings. ICU isolates, especially Klebsiella , showed marked carbapenem resistance. Multi-drug resistance (MDR) was most common in ICU (58%), with extensively drug-resistant at 22%. The empirical therapy model indicated lower predicted success in ICU compared to OPD and IPD. Conclusion: The high prevalence of MDR, particularly in ICU settings, underscores the need for strict antimicrobial stewardship and infection control. Tailored empirical therapy based on local resistance patterns is essential to improve patient outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury is characterized by persistent spontaneous pain and evoked pain responses, such as mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Although inflammatory and metabolic reprogramming has been implicated in central sensitization, the sex-dependent molecular mechanisms underlying spinal cord injury-induced neuropathic pain remain insufficiently understood. Therefore, this study used an integrated analysis of transcriptomics and metabolomics to investigate the mechanisms underlying sex differences in neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury in rats. We established a rat model of T3 lateral hemisection spinal cord injury and assessed behavioral outcomes on the basis of integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling. Both male and female rats developed significant mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity after spinal cord injury, confirming successful induction of neuropathic pain. However, unbiased multi-omics analyses revealed distinct sex-dependent molecular programs. Male rats exhibited alterations in calcium signaling, serine metabolism, and sphingolipid metabolic pathways, whereas female rats showed prominent changes in T cell receptor signaling and histidine metabolism. These findings suggest that immune–metabolic interactions diverge between sexes and may underlie the observed differences in spontaneous pain chronification after spinal cord injury. Our study highlights the importance of sex-dependent mechanisms in shaping neuroimmune and metabolic responses following spinal cord injury and provides novel insights into the molecular basis of central sensitization in spontaneous pain.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The human gut microbiota is increasingly recognized as a significant factor in the pathogenesis of migraine, potentially via inflammatory pathways. Identifying specific human gut microbiota components associated with migraines, along with the investigation of particular inflammatory proteins, is essential for advancing primary prediction, targeted prevention, and personalized treatment strategies for migraines. We conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization study using publicly available summary statistics from genome-wide association studies. Data for 473 human gut microbiota taxa were obtained from the Finnish national health survey conducted by the National Institute for Health and Welfare study (FINRISK, n = 5959 European participants). Genome-wide association study data (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/) for 91 circulating inflammatory proteins were obtained from 14,824 participants across 11 cohorts using the Olink Target 96 Inflammation panel. Migraine outcome data were obtained from the FinnGen R12 release, with cases defined using ICD-10 code G43. All genome-wide association study analyses were adjusted for sex, age, genotyping batch, and 10 genetic principal components to control population stratification (genomic inflation factors: 1.00–1.05). Inverse variance-weighted Mendelian randomization was the primary analysis method, with Mendelian randomization-Egger, weighted median, and mode-based methods as sensitivity analyses. Two-step Mendelian randomization mediation analysis quantified the proportion of the effects of human gut microbiota on migraine that are mediated through inflammatory proteins. Thirty-seven bacterial genera were found to be associated with migraine using the inverse variance-weighted method. Of these, 18 genera exhibited a negative association, while 19 genera demonstrated a positive association with migraine risk. Additionally, eight inflammatory proteins were found to increase the risk of migraine. Among human gut microbiota, four were observed to reduce inflammatory protein levels, whereas another four were associated with increased inflammatory protein levels. Additionally, five gut microbiota were identified to influence migraine through inflammatory proteins in both Mendelian randomization analyses. Specifically, Actinobacteria, Brachyspiraceae , CAG-269 sp001915995, and Paraglaciecola were found to affect migraine outcomes via inflammatory proteins, with mediation proportions of 12%, 19%, 15.5%, and 6.7%, respectively. Lawsonibacter sp002161175 was identified to influence migraine risk through Oncostatin-M and SLAM, with mediation proportions of 15.6% and 11.3%, respectively. Our study elucidated the role of specific human gut microbiota alterations in the pathogenesis of migraine and highlighted the mediating effects of inflammatory proteins. Targeting these particular human gut microbiota alterations offers a promising strategy for predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine in migraine management, resulting in substantial clinical advancements.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: The transorbital approach (TOA) is a significant advance in minimally invasive neurosurgery, eliminating the need for the extensive craniotomy and brain retraction typically associated with traditional methods. By accessing deep-brain and skull base lesions through a small periorbital incision, TOA significantly reduces surgical trauma, accelerates recovery, and offers superior esthetics. The well-equipped instruments and navigation system provide a magnified, meticulous view, proving effective for complex lesions near the orbital-cranial junction. However, the technique is challenged by the “narrow passage” and cannot be applied to all skull base lesions. Lateral orbitotomy, often performed via an upper eyelid crease incision, is a common corridor that requires careful navigation and anatomic knowledge to facilitate surgical dissection and minimize complications. Postoperative complications are usually transient, including periorbital edema, diplopia, and ptosis. Although serious long-term sequelae are rare, careful manipulation of orbital tissue and pupillary monitoring are crucial to prevent permanent nerve injury or visual impairment. TOA is a safe and valuable technique, provided there is careful patient selection and a high level of surgical expertise.",

    "Abstract": "The article reports on an investigation into the dimensions and shape variability of the atrioventricular and interventricular components of the membranous septum in human fetal hearts at 17-28 weeks. Using stereomicroscope with digital camera and software, we studied 80 normal specimens. In the 17-28 weeks group, the membranous septum length was 1.6±0.78 mm. The atrioventricular component was present in 86.25% of cases, while the interventricular component was present in 73.75% of cases. The length of the atrioventricular component was 0.9 mm at 17-19 weeks, and 1.2 mm at 26-28 weeks. The atrioventricular height increased from 0.75 mm at 17-19 weeks to 1.53 mm at 26-28 weeks. The interventricular component had equal median lengths of 0.57-0.60 mm in the 20-28 weeks group. Its height at 17-22 weeks was 0.75 mm, reaching 1.0 mm at 20-22 weeks, and increasing by no more than 10% in older groups. There were no correlations between atrioventricular or interventricular length and height that indicated great variability of the components in shape. For the atrioventricular component, common shapes were round, oval, and triangular. The interventricular component was mostly round or vertically oval; in some cases, it appeared as a horizontal oval or a vertical slit. The data may be useful for intracardiac fetal surgery, for example, in correction of hypoplastic aortic root and closure of interventricular communication, as well as for connective tissue three-dimensional bioprinting in cardiac abnormalities.",

In this paper, we describe 2 cases and review the prior 8 cases to better characterize its diagnosis and management. All 10 cases presented with culture-negative PJI in Lyme-endemic regions and were confirmed to have Lyme PJI via a positive Borrelia-targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) run on joint specimens. Treatment strategies varied: 5 underwent debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR); 1 had exchange arthroplasty; and 4 were managed non-operatively. Antimicrobial treatment also varied considerably. All patients achieved clinical cure. Lyme disease should be considered a potential cause of culture-negative PJI occurring in endemic regions. Because Borrelia-targeted PCR is not routinely included in standard PJI diagnostic workup, diagnosis may be delayed; therefore, clinicians should consider ordering this test when Lyme PJI is part of the differential.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: This research aimed to assess the impact of 40% hydrogen peroxide bleaching in the workplace and 16% carbamide peroxide bleaching at home on the composite's surface roughness based on Omnichroma and Evetric resin. Materials and Methods: 24-disc composite samples, each measuring 5 mm in diameter and 2 mm in height, were created for this in vitro experimental investigation using every kind of nano-hybrid resin composite material. All composite group's samples were randomly split into 3 subgroups (n=8). Samples in the control subgroup were kept for a week at 37°C in artificial saliva. 40% hydrogen peroxide was used to bleach in-office bleaching samples. Samples of home bleaching were be bleached by 16% carbamide peroxide. Measurements of surface roughness were made for every sample in every subgroup. Samples of control sub-group were be considered as base line data. Both parametric and non-parametric statistical analyses were performed at P≤0.05 using the SPSS software (version 25 for Windows). Results: For both studied materials, all subgroups' surface roughness levels dropped below the threshold point (Ra&lt;0.2 μm). The Kruskal–Wallis test revealed a significant difference among the Omnichroma subgroups (p = 0.002). Additionally, the one-way ANOVA confirmed a significant difference among the Evetric subgroups (p=0.035). Conclusions: All tested subgroups of both Omnichroma and Evetric composites showed surface roughness degree below the clinically acceptable threshold (Ra &lt; 0.2 µm). Bleaching with 40% H2O2 and 16% carbamide peroxide gels did not produce a clinically significant increase in surface roughness for either material.",

It is morphologically similar to the typical C. purpurea from Crimea (Ukraine) but differs in leaf and bract size, peduncle and involucral hair types, inner involucral bract size, bracteole shape and size as well as length of corolla, stamen, anther, filament, stigma, ovary size, and width of sterile achene. Crepis purpurea subsp. gulderenae is distributed in the marly and gypsiferous soils around the Aysantı pass in the Ayaş district in the northwest of Ankara province, Türkiye. This region is an important plant biodiversity hotspot, where many newly discovered endemic species reside. Previously Crepis purpurea subsp. gulderenae was known as C. purpurea in Türkiye, and its taxonomy was updated based on field surveys data and macro- and micromorphological studies. Two DNA regions were examined: nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (nrITS) which was identical for typical and new subspecies of C. purpurea and chloroplast region atpB-rbcL which was also very similar. A comprehensive description, distribution map, habitat and ecological preferences, IUCN category, and diagnostic key for Crepis purpurea subsp. gulderenae are presented.",

    "Abstract": "The development of society through the centuries led to the improvement of healthcare and hygiene conditions throughout the world and, thus, the generalization of ceramic sanitary ware. Indeed, this industry possesses a huge financial impact on the global economy, employing thousands of people worldwide. In spite of their high production levels and increased efficiency, the sanitary ware manufacturing process is still characterized by some defects which make the commercialization of these products unfeasible. Currently, these flaws are rectified by a refiring in the kiln; however the defective parts occupy space intended for new ones to be produced and there is a high chance of new defects arising or the component to break due to the excessive heat of a second firing, hugely increasing the production costs. Accordingly, in this article a sustainable alternative is proposed, using a CO2 laser to repair only the defect area, thus leaving the remaining part untouched. Several laser parameters were tested in experimental tests of two different kinds of defects, using quantitative and qualitative analysis methods, through colour difference reading (with an ANOVA approach), and the optical microscope, SEM-EDS and chemical analyses, respectively. The best results considering defects provoked on a white coloured part were obtained with the manual firing for a laser power between 50 and 70 W, and an interaction time of 1 to 3 firings of 10 s each. These values apply for both pinholes and fissures, with a 50 W power and an interaction of 30 s being the best.",

    "Abstract": "Photo-biofuel-cell (PBFC) self-powered sensors are emerging as effective tools for food safety analysis because light-driven charge generation can be directly coupled with redox catalysis to produce bias-free signals with inherent amplification in complex matrices. Unlike photoelectrochemical sensors that commonly depend on external biasing or sacrificial reagents and biofuel cell sensors restricted by limited driving force and catalyst instability, PBFCs function as closed energy signal systems in which photovoltage and interfacial reaction pathways jointly govern signal output. This review consolidates recent progress by relating photocarrier behavior, interfacial field regulation, and cathodic charge utilization to analytical sensitivity, operational stability, and matrix tolerance. Material and interface strategies across photoanodes, photocathodes, and recognition layers are examined, including band structure modulation, heterojunction construction, conductive architectures, and interface gating for controlled charge transfer upon target binding. Representative applications involving antibiotics, pesticides, heavy metals, and toxins are discussed with attention to dual photoelectrode operation, microfluidic regulation, and ratiometric or multiplex readouts. These developments indicate that PBFCs are advancing toward reliable on-site sensing in real food matrices.",

    "Abstract": "Aim of the study: Vibriosis and other bacterial infections significantly challenge Pacific white shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) production. This study evaluated the immunostimulant effect of nucleotide supplementation on hemato-immunological parameters, digestive gland morphology, presumptive Vibrio count, and survival of Penaeus vannamei exposed to Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Area of study: Aquaculture nutrition and health management, specifically focusing on the mitigation of bacterial disease (Vibriosis) in cultured Pacific white shrimp. Material and methods: Three nucleotide supplementation levels were evaluated: NT75 (75 mg/kg), NT150 (150 mg/kg), and NT300 (300 mg/kg), alongside a control group (C). After 60 days of feeding the experimental diets, the shrimp were challenged by immersion in a bacterial suspension of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (106 CFU mL-1) for 30 days. Mortality and clinical signs were monitored, and hemato-immunological, histological, and bacteriological parameters were analyzed. Main results: Nucleotide-supplemented treatments exhibited improved growth performance and reduced pre-challenge mortality. Following the bacterial challenge, all treatments showed an acute, albeit non-significant, change in total and differential hemocyte counts. However, histological analysis of the digestive gland revealed severe lesions, including tubule deformities and necrosis, across all treatment groups. On days 5 and 15, significant differences in Vibrio sp. counts within the digestive gland were observed. Specifically, differences were noted between Control (C) and NT75, and between NT75 and NT300, indicating varying bacterial colonization over time. Research highlights: Higher nucleotide supplementation levels improved shrimp performance, reduced pre-challenge mortality, and enhanced the acute immune response following a bacterial challenge, suggesting their utility as an effective immunostimulant against Vibriosis.",

While past studies including recent ones in windsurfing or sailing aerodynamics have relied on reduced-scale rigid sail models and numerical simulations, there is a lack of experimental data on the full-scale flying shape of deformable sails. In particular, iQFOil class - new Olympic windsurf class - still lacks of direct measurements to potentially validate Fluid Structure Interaction model, in order to improve the accuracy of Velocity Program Prediction. The 3D flying shape of a real-scale 8 m2 iQFOiL class windsurf sail is measured in steady state sailing configurations. The outdoor conditions are simulated in a large-scale wind tunnel and the flying shape is reconstructed with a stereo camera imaging technique. Together with the sail shape, we measure simultaneously the aerodynamic forces and moments applied to the sail. With the measured forces and moments, the lift, drag and roll coefficients are determined for wind velocities ranging from 4 to 8 m/s. A systematic decrease of these coefficients is observed as compared to previous studies on reduced-scale rigid sail model, because of the rigging deformation due to wind loading. We thus establish experimentally benchmark data for the iQFOiL sail and more generally for compliant rigging.

    "Abstract": "Recent advances in generative image models have enabled the creation of highly realistic political deepfakes, posing serious risks to information integrity, public trust, and democratic processes. While automated deepfake detectors are increasingly deployed in moderation and investigative pipelines, most existing systems provide only point predictions and fail to indicate when outputs are unreliable—an operationally critical limitation in high-stakes political contexts. This work investigated conditional, uncertainty-aware political deepfake detection using stochastic convolutional neural networks within a strictly empirical, decision-oriented reliability framework. Rather than framing uncertainty from a purely Bayesian or interpretive perspective, uncertainty was evaluated through observable criteria, including calibration and its relationship to prediction errors under global and confidence-conditioned evaluation regimes. A politically focused binary image dataset was constructed via deterministic metadata-based filtering from a large public real–synthetic corpus. Two pretrained CNN backbones, ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B4, were fully fine-tuned end-to-end for binary classification. Deterministic inference was compared with stochastic procedures, including single-pass stochastic prediction, Monte Carlo dropout with multiple forward passes, temperature scaling for calibration, and an ensemble-based uncertainty surrogate as a non-Bayesian reference. Evaluation protocols were defined, with the fake class treated as positive, ROC-AUC and thresholded confusion matrices reported, and experiments conducted under controlled in-distribution settings with supplementary generator-disjoint out-of-distribution analysis. The results showed that calibrated probabilistic outputs and uncertainty estimates supported downstream decision-making by enabling risk-aware moderation policies. A systematic confidence-band analysis further delineated when uncertainty added operational value beyond predicted confidence, clarifying the practical scope and limitations of uncertainty-aware deepfake detection in political contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Traditionally, financial institutions have been the trusted place to hold funds in a safe and sound environment where consumers and nonconsumers receive products and services to maintain their financial well-being. Financial technology (FinTech) companies have emerged as a major alternative to traditional banking for many consumers, according to an October 2023 report by McKinsey &amp; Company.1 These FinTechs, however, still need to rely on traditional financial institutions to provide their path to the payment channels through the Federal Reserve System. These relationships with third parties offering products and services to consumers bring opportunities for large deposits but also expose them to risks that require strategic risk management programmes. This paper explores these third-party relationships, how they function, the evolving automated clearinghouse (ACH) risk management requirements from the National Automated Clearing House Association (Nacha), mitigation controls to reduce related risks and recommended measures for the industry to strengthen the financial system and reduce fraud losses.

    "Abstract": "Background Abdominal obesity is a growing public health issue, even among individuals with a body mass index (BMI) considered normal. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify factors associated with abdominal obesity among adults with a normal BMI in Gombe Matadi, Democratic Republic of Congo. Methods This study is based on a secondary analysis of data from a cross-sectional survey conducted in 2019 in Gombe Matadi. Among the 1,531 adults in the initial study, 1,039 with a normal body mass index were retained for this analysis. Sampling was carried out using a probabilistic cluster method in the first study, but here, according to convenience, anthropometric measurements as well as sociodemographic and behavioral variables were retained. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 25.0 software, using multivariate logistic regression. Results The study highlights a 14.8% prevalence of abdominal obesity among adults with a normal body mass index. Several factors were identified as being significantly associated with this condition, including female gender, age under 40, and a higher level of education. Furthermore, certain health behaviors such as smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and a history of high blood pressure also appear to play a determining role. Conclusions Body mass index alone is not effective in identifying abdominal obesity in adults. It is essential to integrate waist circumference measurement into diagnosis and screening to better assess risks associated with cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.",

    "Abstract": "Axolotls ( Ambystoma mexicanum ) exhibit a remarkable ability to regenerate limbs. Classical experiments have suggested that contact between cells derived from distinct orientations—dorsal, ventral, anterior, and posterior—within the regenerating blastema is necessary for accurate limb pattern formation. However, the molecular basis for this requirement has remained largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that both dorsal and ventral tissues are required for limb formation via induction of Shh expression, which plays a crucial role in limb patterning. Using the accessory limb model, we induced position-specific blastemas lacking cells derived from a single orientation (anterior, posterior, dorsal, or ventral). Limb patterning occurred only in blastemas containing both dorsal- and ventral-derived cells. We further observed that Shh expression requires dorsoventral contact within a blastema, highlighting the necessity of dorsoventral contact for inducing Shh expression. Additionally, we identified WNT10B and FGF2 as dorsal- and ventral-mediated signals, respectively, that create the inductive environment for Shh expression. Our findings clarify the role of dorsal and ventral cells in inducing Shh , a mechanism that has rarely been studied in the context of limb regeneration and pattern formation. This model provides new insights into how cells with different positional identities drive the regeneration process.",

    "Abstract": "Early-stage identification of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a sizeable challenge to health care globally due to its progressive nature and the fact that there is no available effective treatment. It becomes strategic for practices using interventions meant to halt or reverse cognitive decline if diagnosed early. Recent medical imaging advancements, mainly Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), have greatly unveiled subtle pathological changes associated with this disease. Studies have shown that multimodal neuroimaging can provide crucial information regarding the structural and functional changes in the brain that are associated with AD. However, more research is required to establish sustainable techniques for the detection of AD at all its stages. In this research, a framework of Moth Flame Optimized UNet++ with self-attention is proposed to analyze multi-modal inputs of Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI), PET, and neuropsychological test data for the classification of Alzheimer’s disease ( UNet + + SA –MFO). The framework involves pre-processing the sMRI and PET images to denoise, skull strip, denormalization, next captures complex texture patterns and spatial relationships from both images by placing attention gates at skip connections to ensure reduction of irrelevant features and enhanced localization of significant features. Neuropsychological assessments are passed through fully connected layers of UNet++. Moth Flame Optimization optimizes hyperparameters. Then, a fused feature set is created as a concatenation of all features from multi-modal inputs. Support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), and Random Forest are used to model, and later weighted stacking ensemble is used to predict the output. The framework is implemented in Python, and evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, Accuracy, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) are analyzed. UNet++ SA –MFO attains effective 90.5%, 89.9%, 90.2%, 91.8% and 94.1% precision, recall, F1-score, Accuracy and AUC-ROC against existing multi-modal ensemble frameworks. The above findings highlight the potential of enhanced UNet++ augmented with self-attention-based feature extraction and the benefit of integrating innovative optimization for more precise Alzheimer’s Disease diagnosis and classification at the early stage. This proposed framework provides valuable contributions to Alzheimer’s Disease pathology insight, improved diagnostic sensitivity, and ultimately, improved management of this neurological disease.",

    "Abstract": "The problem of toxic pollution of the environment by combustion products of explosives and rocket fuel is becoming increasingly important in the context of intensified military operations. In this study, the toxicity of TNT derivatives, hydrazine-based compounds, and nitroaromatic transformation products related to explosive and rocket fuel contamination was evaluated using the model organisms Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus, 1758 and Opatrum sabulosum (Linnaeus, 1761). We chose hydrazine derivatives, nitroanilines, benzene and naphthalene-based nitro compounds that can persist in the ground, water and atmosphere after explosions or incomplete combustion of rocket fuel. Topical dispersion was used to evaluate exposure of specified doses on the surface of containers containing larvae and imagoes of T. molitor and imagoes of O. sabulosum , followed by lethality counts and LC 50 determination. The results indicate the high sensitivity of T. molitor larvae and imagoes and O. sabulosum imagoes to TNT derivatives, hydrazine compounds, and nitroaromatic contaminants commonly found in explosive-contaminated environments, which confirms the feasibility of introducing ecotoxicological monitoring of military-technological impact zones. The systematic toxicity assessment of these 29 explosive-related compounds provides essential baseline data for environmental risk modeling and ecotoxicological monitoring programs. The data obtained can be used for further modeling of environmental risk and development of bioindicator approaches to detect pollution as a result of military operations, for example, in Ukraine.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study investigated how playing experience influences joint kinetics and ball-release velocity during mid- and long-range jump shots. Wrist, elbow, shoulder and knee rate of torque development (RTD), peak power (P peak ), and angular impulse (AI) were quantified, along with vertical release velocity (VV) and horizontal release velocity (HV) at release. Methods In a cross-sectional design, 15 experienced and 15 novice male collegiate basketball players each performed three made jump shots from 4.8 m and 6.75 m. A 3-D motion-capture system synchronised with force plates provided the data used to compute RTD, P peak , AI, VV and HV. Outcomes were compared with a two-way mixed ANOVA. Results Experienced players exhibited greater wrist AI ( p &lt; 0.001), elbow RTD ( p = 0.002), P peak ( p = 0.045) and AI ( p &lt; 0.001), knee P peak ( p = 0.002) and VV ( p &lt; 0.001). Longer shooting distance increased shoulder P peak ( p = 0.036) and HV ( p = 0.018). Conclusions Collectively, these results show that experience enhances joint kinetic output, providing the mechanical foundation for more efficient and dependable shooting. For novice players, emphasising wrist-endurance work, explosive-power training for the elbow and knee, and targeted drills to raise VV is recommended to improve overall on-court shooting performance.",
