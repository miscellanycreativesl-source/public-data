This study aimed to develop and validate a liquid chromatography\\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC\\u2013MS\\/MS) method for the simultaneous detection and quantification of fentanyl, buprenorphine, oxycodone, morphine, tramadol, and tapentadol in plasma and oral fluid. The method was validated according to FDA guidelines, assessing selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, matrix effect, extraction efficiency, stability, carryover, and dilution integrity. The lower limits of quantification (LLOQs) were established at 0.1 ng\\/mL for fentanyl, 1.2 ng\\/mL for tramadol, and 0.6 ng\\/mL for the remaining opioids, demonstrating high sensitivity. The method exhibited excellent precision and accuracy, with coefficients of variation below 15% for intra-day, inter-day, and intermediate precision analyses. Extraction efficiencies exceeded 90% for most analytes, and matrix effects remained within acceptable limits. Real-world application to authentic plasma and oral fluid samples confirmed the method\\u2019s robustness and reliability. Oral fluid concentrations were detectable across all target opioids, although plasma\\u2013oral fluid ratios showed some compound-dependent variability. These findings highlight the potential of oral fluid as a non-invasive complementary matrix to plasma for opioid monitoring, with relevant implications for forensic toxicology and clinical drug monitoring.

It is readily produced during explosive eruptions but also can be generated in large quantities by secondary processes. We evaluated the production and resuspension of sub-10 \\u03bcm volcanic particulate matter (PM 10 ) by road traffic as these processes may generate an increased respiratory exposure hazard. We conducted experiments on the slopes of Etna volcano, where we drove with a small SUV-type car over an area of road artificially covered with tephra and investigated the resulting grain size distribution (GSD) and concentration of PM 10 in the air as a function of (1) the number of car passages, (2) the starting thickness of the tephra deposit, and (3) vehicle speed. Our data show that increasing the number of car passages, deposit thickness, and vehicle speed rapidly induces a decrease in the GSD of tephra deposits and results in increased airborne PM 10 . We show that vehicles will cause comminution (i.e., reduction to a smaller average particle size) and resuspension of basaltic ash, so local communities can expect that, after an eruption, concentrations of PM 10 may increase with time and affect exposures close to roads.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"Artificial Life and Robotics\",\"Author\":\"Koifman, Yigal\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Cites\":12,\"Cited by\":0,\"Related to\":0,\"Topic\":\"Evacuation and Crowd Dynamics\",\"Subfield\":\"Ocean Engineering\",\"Field\":\"Engineering\",\"Domain\":\"Physical Sciences\",\"Open Access status\":\"hybrid\",\"DOI\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s10015-025-01104-3\",\"Title\":\"Distributed and decentralized task allocation for heterogeneous swarms\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract This paper presents a multi-layered framework for fully distributed and decentralized task allocation in heterogeneous swarms, derived from interaction-based dynamics. This approach is built upon a baseline of homogeneous swarms composed of simple, autonomous, identical, locally sensing agents. Agents operate under the \\u201cflexible swarm\\u201d paradigm, which promotes global cohesion through local interactions that prevent swarm fragmentation. We demonstrate how a desired swarm behavior of exploration, task detection, and requirement fulfillment can emerge from local motion rules based solely on self-sensing without explicit inter-agent communication. Starting from a homogeneous baseline of identical agents, we extend the framework to heterogeneous swarms composed of agents with varying sensing capabilities and payloads. We introduce a novel interaction scheme in which two homogeneous groups, scouts and fire-extinguishers, are functionally coupled through local sensing, forming an emergent heterogeneous system. This coupled coordination enables distributed fire detection and suppression, enhancing robustness and scalability. The framework is validated through firefighting simulations, utilizing a heterogeneous swarm composed of scout agents with long-range sensing and fire-extinguishing agents with limited perception and actuation abilities. Through simple local motion rules, agents self-organize to detect and extinguish fires in a cooperative manner, driven solely by local sensing and interaction forces. Various fire suppression simulations demonstrate clear trade-offs between scouting and fire-extinguishing capacities. Our simulation results show that scouting dominates overall performance, whereas adding more fire-extinguishers provides only marginal improvement beyond a critical ratio. The results demonstrate that decentralized control of heterogeneous swarms enhances scalability, robustness, and efficiency even under direct communication denial.

Effective management requires understanding their distribution, density, and habitat preferences. This study predicted wild boar habitat suitability in Northern Greece (Macedonia and Thrace) using the Maxent species distribution modelling algorithm. Presence data from hunting sites were combined with environmental variables, including bioclimatic factors, land cover, and topography. The model performed well, with an AUC of 0.86 and a TSS of 0.52. The five most important predictors were land cover, mean temperature of the coldest month, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of the warmest quarter, and elevation. Highly suitable habitats included areas near water sources (e.g., rivers, marshes), diverse forests, transitional woodland-shrub zones, and agricultural regions with natural vegetation. To assess potential disease transmission risk, we used the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic to identify spatial clusters of domestic pig farms. We found areas where high wild boar habitat suitability overlapped with dense pig farm clusters, indicating zones of increased risk for African swine fever (ASF) transmission. ASF outbreak patterns supported the relevance of these risk zones but also highlighted the importance of non-spatial, human-mediated transmission pathways. This study offers insights for wildlife management and disease prevention, highlighting priority areas for monitoring and intervention in Northern Greece.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"New Forests\",\"Author\":\"Abby E.

Invasive plants and Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) contribute to regeneration failure by impacting tree seedling survival and growth. This study investigated the individual and interactive effects of deer and woody invasive plants on seedlings in an early successional forest. In a stand of Juniperus virginiana near Oxford, OH, we initiated a factorial experiment with each combination of deer access\\/exclosure and invasive woody plants removed\\/not removed. Deer were excluded with 2.13 m tall fences using four trees as corner posts. We planted native tree seedlings and monitored natural regeneration (tree seedlings 0.3\\u20132 m) in each plot. Survival was low for planted seedlings and growth differed across species but, in general, change in height was significantly impacted by deer and the interaction: excluding deer resulted in less height loss and this effect was greater where invasives were present. Change in height of natural regeneration (mostly Fraxinus americana ) was significantly affected by deer; seedlings grew taller in deer exclosures. The total number of seedlings recruiting per plot did not differ among treatments. However, the number of recruits excluding F. americana seedlings showed a marginally significant interaction: number of recruits was greatest where deer and invasives were removed. Overall, deer had a greater impact than invasives on natural regeneration and planted seedlings. These small exclosures required minimal cost, installation time, and maintenance. These findings lead us to recommend this method to land managers.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"Reading and Writing\",\"Author\":\"Ralph P.

However, direct application of LLMs faces challenges, including the large and indivisible nature of optimization problems, slow optimization, error-prone code generation, and underutilization of LLM reasoning capabilities. This study introduces AutoLFM, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging LLMs to automate the end-to-end BLF model development workflow. AutoLFM decomposes the complex modeling process using a two-stage optimization strategy, with specialized LLM agents (Retriever, Reasoner, Coder, and Validator) performing distinct tasks. Key mechanisms include dynamic knowledge retrieval for prompt enhancement, data-adaptive search space generation by the Reasoner, and verification-enhanced code generation between the Coder and Validator. Experimental evaluations on three real-world building datasets demonstrate that AutoLFM efficiently generates BLF models, achieving predictive accuracy comparable to or exceeding manually designed baselines and other LLM-based methods, with an average R 2 improvement of 12.3%. It shortens the traditional development cycle from weeks to hours while achieving a 100% code generation success rate.

A typology of ChatGPT early adopters\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract The world continues to debate the benefits, possibilities, failures, and risks of general-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT. With new tools and features being released at a high frequency, early adopters are eager to utilize them in various ways. Yet the priorities of these early adopters vary widely depending on their specific needs, capabilities, motivations, and usage patterns. In this study, we therefore explore how and why early adopters choose to use general-purpose AI tools. To do so, we draw on data from an online survey conducted among early ChatGPT users ( n = 344) in April 2023, shortly after its public release. Based on this data, we identify six main dimensions determining the adoption of general-purpose AI tools: Utilitarian Value, Trust in AI, Convenience Value, Specific Job Utility, Perceived Social Presence, and Privacy Concerns. We then extend theories of innovation diffusion and technology adoption by empirically characterizing four early adopter archetypes: AI Enthusiasts, Na\\u00efve Pragmatists, Cautious Adopters, and Reserved Explorers. Distinguishing these archetypes helps devise interventions for effective AI adoption from a dual-use (i.e., functional-emotional vs. social-relational) and risk-reward trade-off (e.g., utility vs. privacy) perspective. In light of these insights, we offer practical implications for the market design and commercialization of general-purpose AI tools tailored to the priorities of each adopter archetype.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"International Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems Research\",\"Author\":\"Sasaki, Tatsuya\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Cites\":5,\"Cited by\":0,\"Related to\":0,\"Topic\":\"Human Mobility and Location-Based Analysis\",\"Subfield\":\"Transportation\",\"Field\":\"Social Sciences\",\"Domain\":\"Social Sciences\",\"Open Access status\":\"hybrid\",\"DOI\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s13177-025-00618-1\",\"Title\":\"Extraction of Behavior\\u2013Attribute Relationships through Nonnegative Tensor Factorization of Independently Collected Transit and Purchase Histories\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract In Japan, railway operators have played a pivotal role in promoting urban mobility and consumption by managing commercial facilities in conjunction with transportation infrastructure based on population growth. However, the population has declined in recent years.

The objective of this study was to elucidate the visitation and consumption patterns surrounding railway stations by integrating the analysis of transportation and purchasing behavior, which have traditionally been examined independently. In this study, two independent datasets were utilized: transit smart card data for ticket gate entry and exit and loyalty card data from commercial facilities in the station integrated area. The utilization of these datasets makes it possible to estimate the number of individuals residing in the facilities and surrounding areas.

Numerical models were obtained via Response surface method (RSM) for economic response evaluation depending on feedstock price and applied tax rate. Sugarcane remains the superior feedstock, with a net present value (NPV) of ($22,211,942.44). Cassava and yam, despite facing several challenges leading to negative NPVs of ($499,753,466.22) and ($173,103,763.14) respectively, exhibited commendable ethanol yields and the capacity for electricity co-production. The study revealed an electricity production potential of up to 171.330 kWh for yam, compared to 151.020 kWh for sugarcane. Achieving a positive electric balance remains a challenge, with the best-case scenario being sugarcane at 77% electric supply of its requirements. While sugarcane remains the predominant choice for bioethanol production in Colombia (0.68 USD\\/l), cassava (2.28 USD\\/l) and yam (1.11 USD\\/l) present viable alternatives under strategic enhancements in agricultural productivity and cost management.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"International Journal of the Sociology of Leisure\",\"Author\":\"Tully, Paul\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Cites\":47,\"Cited by\":0,\"Related to\":0,\"Topic\":\"Geographies of human-animal interactions\",\"Subfield\":\"Geography, Planning and Development\",\"Field\":\"Social Sciences\",\"Domain\":\"Social Sciences\",\"Open Access status\":\"hybrid\",\"DOI\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s41978-026-00199-7\",\"Title\":\"The Silencing of Nonhuman Animals in the Social Construction of Botanic Gardens\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract This paper concerns the social construction of gardens, with a focus on the position of nonhuman animals in a specific garden type, the botanical one. As such, the paper deviates from the embedded idea in Western society that gardens are only home to cultivated plants and flowers of human choosing. This paper contributes to the ongoing animal turn of the leisure field and the particular focus on recognising outdoor leisure spaces as multispecies in nature. Through a newspaper analysis of the Otago Daily Times (1861 to 1950), the paper explores the socio-cultural history of a botanic garden. In finding silence through the analysis, it becomes apparent that the settler community of Dunedin, New Zealand, created the botanic garden with an invisibility towards nonhuman animals. The study of local newspapers suggests that over a century ago, the British colonisers of New Zealand lacked a nuanced appreciation of the multispecies nature of botanic gardens.

This study examined the risks associated with beef production and assessed the strategies that producers employ to manage them. We conducted online surveys in the USA and France to examine these risks. Based on responses from 111 to 61 beef producers from the USA and France, respectively, we categorised risks into five categories: production, financial, market, human and personal, and political risks. We then rated them, analysed their intensity, and studied their temporal and spatial aspects. Additionally, we assessed the influence of risk factors and beef producers\\u2019 characteristics on risk management strategy adoption. The respondents from the USA ranked policy, financial and human risks high. In contrast, production and market risks emerged as high-ranked risks among the respondents from France. Beef producers in the USA engaged more in risk reduction and acceptance approaches, while beef producers in France displayed higher adoption rates for collaborative strategies. Experience and perceived risks strongly shaped strategy adoption. Mid-to-late career producers were more likely to use risk reduction and transfer mechanisms, and very experienced or income-diversified producers were less likely to rely on risk acceptance. In the USA, focusing on policies for enhancing financial resilience and improved access to land and labour could improve resilience in beef production operations. Beef producers in France may benefit from continued support for climate adaptation and risk management in production.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"Carbon Research\",\"Author\":\"Zhang, Shichao\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Cites\":25,\"Cited by\":0,\"Related to\":0,\"Topic\":\"Supercapacitor Materials and Fabrication\",\"Subfield\":\"Electronic, Optical and Magnetic Materials\",\"Field\":\"Materials Science\",\"Domain\":\"Physical Sciences\",\"Open Access status\":\"hybrid\",\"DOI\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1007\\/s44246-025-00255-z\",\"Title\":\"Lignin-derived hierarchical porous carbons enabling high-voltage electrochemical capacitors with low self-discharge\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract The widespread deployment of electrochemical capacitors in energy-intensive technologies is fundamentally limited by their low energy density and severe self-discharge.

Trial Chamber X also accepted the Prosecution\\u2019s conclusion that applying different forms of Sharia punishments amounted to the crime of torture. Such an expansive view of core international crimes has the potential to send an alienating message to Muslim communities around the world and particularly those countries that apply Sharia criminal law. The overriding narrative of the article does not diminish the harm caused by Ansar Eddine but rather presents an alternative to the Trial Chamber\\u2019s and the Prosecution\\u2019s reasoning, campaigning for more active engagement with the principles of Sharia. As discussed at length, the duty of an international court is to adapt a multicultural and diverse interpretative guidelines by considering more traditional systems of justice. In that regard, the ICC has yielded to the universalists and Eurocentric agenda by deciding to dismiss Islamic traditions in their entirety. While Sharia based punishments remain shocking for the Western societies, their spiritual, religious, and exonerating value remains poignant for the Muslim majority states and communities. The practices cannot be therefore dismissed, and if looked at in line with the Third World Approaches to International Law could enrich the legal reasoning for future investigations and trials.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"Experimental & Molecular Medicine\",\"Author\":\"Lee, Minyoung\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Cites\":52,\"Cited by\":0,\"Related to\":0,\"Topic\":\"Pancreatic function and diabetes\",\"Subfield\":\"Surgery\",\"Field\":\"Medicine\",\"Domain\":\"Health Sciences\",\"Open Access status\":\"gold\",\"DOI\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1038\\/s12276-025-01625-8\",\"Title\":\"Impaired insulin secretion via the Wnt5a\\/\\u03b2-catenin pathway contributes to diabetes development in pancreatic cancer\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract Diabetes is highly prevalent in individuals with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and even precedes diagnosis of PDAC; however, the mechanisms of pancreatic cancer-associated blood glucose deterioration remain largely unknown. Here, we constructed a prospective cohort of patients undergoing pancreatectomy to investigate the underlying mechanism of PDAC-associated hyperglycemia. A total of 160 patients who underwent pancreatectomy (72 patients with PDAC and 88 patients without PDAC) were enrolled at a tertiary care hospital. Glucometabolic parameters under oral glucose tolerance test were assessed in both pre- and postoperative periods, and patient-derived blood and pancreatic tissue samples were collected. Compared with patients without PDAC, patients with PDAC showed severe hyperglycemia with impaired insulin secretion before surgery. However, despite identical type of pancreatectomy in both groups, hyperglycemia improved more significantly and insulin secretory function declined less after pancreatectomy in patients with PDAC. Plasma Wnt5a and pancreatic islet \\u03b2-catenin levels were higher in patients with PDAC and correlated with the degree of hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency. Plasma Wnt5a levels also correlated with tumor size and pancreatic islet \\u03b2-catenin expression in patients with PDAC. In rodent islets, Wnt5a treatment suppressed insulin release, which was recovered by inhibition of \\u03b2-catenin. Collectively, impaired pancreatic insulin secretion by aberrant Wnt5a\\/\\u03b2-catenin activation may underlie the hyperglycemia associated with PDAC. Our finding provides insights into the unique molecular mechanism of pancreatic cancer-associated hyperglycemia, paving the way for the identification of potential biomarker and therapeutic targets for this condition.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"Microsystems & Nanoengineering\",\"Author\":\"Lee, Taeim\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Cites\":174,\"Cited by\":0,\"Related to\":0,\"Topic\":\"3D Printing in Biomedical Research\",\"Subfield\":\"Biomedical Engineering\",\"Field\":\"Engineering\",\"Domain\":\"Physical Sciences\",\"Open Access status\":\"gold\",\"DOI\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1038\\/s41378-025-01149-1\",\"Title\":\"Innovations in skin microphysiological systems for nonclinical testing and FDA modernization\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract Recent innovations in skin microphysiological systems (MPSs) have gained momentum following regulatory advances such as the FDA Modernization Act 2.0 and the global shift toward alternatives to animal testing.

Birds from different families construct a tail of hung materials underneath their nests, which has been hypothesized to be a type of disruptive camouflage, i.e. an appendage that gives a nest a false shape for hindering detection by predators. Predictions of this hypothesis are that for predators that are visually oriented, nests without a tail are easier to detect, yet this hypothesis never received support likely because predator species and other variables were not considered. Here, we compared predation between nests of blue manakins for which tails were maintained or experimentally removed. To avoid the effects of parental movements in predator\\u2019s attraction, we used real inactive nests with Plasticine eggs. We also controlled for nest site variables and excluded nests depredated by olfactory animals by monitoring nests with infrared camera traps. Predation was 10 times higher in nests without a tail, and tail absence was the only significant variable explaining nest predation. Furthermore, all of the recorded predators were visually oriented. This is the first work confirming the antipredatory adaptive function of avian nest tails, and corroborated the disruptive camouflage hypothesis.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"Biology Letters\",\"Author\":\"Baranowski, Kelsee\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Cites\":48,\"Cited by\":0,\"Related to\":0,\"Topic\":\"Viral Infections and Outbreaks Research\",\"Subfield\":\"Infectious Diseases\",\"Field\":\"Medicine\",\"Domain\":\"Health Sciences\",\"Open Access status\":\"hybrid\",\"DOI\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1098\\/rsbl.2025.0654\",\"Title\":\"Multiple environmental conditions precede Ebola spillovers in Central Africa\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract Many emerging viruses of public health concern originate in animals and have the potential to transmit to humans or cause spillover. Orthoebolavirus zairense (EBOV) is one example, circulating in wildlife in Central and West Africa, with high mortality in humans and animals.

However, a universal driver or mechanism has not been described and spillovers remain unpredictable. To assess potential environmental determinants of EBOV spillovers, we analysed time series of vegetation health, rainfall, temperature, forest loss and human population size surrounding Central African spillover locations from 1990 to 2022. We evaluated whether environmental conditions before spillover were atypical for each location by quantifying the similarities in environmental time series between spillover years and non-spillover years. Contrary to past work, we found no single environmental trigger that universally prompts spillover. While some outbreaks were preceded by atypical environmental conditions, others occurred when conditions were strongly similar to non-spillover years. We also modelled the relationship between anthropogenic factors and the occurrence of spillover and found no association. We find EBOV spillovers occur following various environmental conditions and no consistent anthropogenic associations.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"Journal of The Royal Society Interface\",\"Author\":\"Jorge Servert Lerdo De Tejada\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Cites\":33,\"Cited by\":0,\"Related to\":0,\"Topic\":\"Spectroscopy Techniques in Biomedical and Chemical Research\",\"Subfield\":\"Biophysics\",\"Field\":\"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology\",\"Domain\":\"Life Sciences\",\"Open Access status\":\"hybrid\",\"DOI\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1098\\/rsif.2025.0405\",\"Title\":\"Optimizing spatially offset Raman spectroscopy designs: balancing signal and safety in biomedical applications\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract Spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (SORS) offers non-invasive, molecularly specific access to subsurface tissues, showing strong potential for biomedical diagnostics.

Central to this process is the interaction between MLKL and its upstream regulator, RIPK3, forming a functional module called the necrosome that governs the spatiotemporal execution of cell death. Despite progress in our understanding of necroptotic signalling, key open questions remain. The structural organization of MLKL influences its interaction with RIPK3, yet the precise features of their binding surfaces and their regulation are not fully resolved.

Similarly, energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) techniques were used for the surface characterization. The FESEM analysis revealed a more uniform and smooth surface with a few pits and cracks in the presence of SDS, indicating the formation of a protective film on the MS surface. The presence of an intense high peak of carbon, oxygen and sulfur in the EDX spectra confirmed the adsorption of the SDS molecule on the metal surface. The increased weight composition of elements further supported the adsorption of SDS on the metal surface.

Globally, during the first year of this pandemic, controls were primarily focused on containing the outbreak and minimizing infection, disease and health consequences. However, during the second year (2021) with vaccines being deployed, there was a recognition that mitigation measures needed to consider both infection control and socio-economic priorities, inevitably causing a tension between how these conflicting elements are balanced. In England, this was epitomized by the Roadmap out of Lockdown, which through four planned steps reduced controls from the January 2021 lockdown to no restrictions on social interactions. Here, we adopt a health-economic framework to consider a range of alternative approaches to the relaxation of controls, allowing us to quantitatively assess health losses (measured in quality adjusted life years, QALYs) and economic consequences (measured in terms of gross domestic product, GDP) in a unified framework. Using the UK Treasury framework of valuing one QALY at \\u00a370 000, we find that the implemented Roadmap performs extremely well, only being consistently outperformed by a similar strategy that starts all steps one week earlier. This work highlights the power of a holistic framework combining epidemiology and economics and suggests its utility in future outbreaks.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"Royal Society Open Science\",\"Author\":\"Daripa, Prabir\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Cites\":26,\"Cited by\":0,\"Related to\":0,\"Topic\":\"Nonlinear Waves and Solitons\",\"Subfield\":\"Statistical and Nonlinear Physics\",\"Field\":\"Physics and Astronomy\",\"Domain\":\"Physical Sciences\",\"Open Access status\":\"gold\",\"DOI\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1098\\/rsos.251726\",\"Title\":\"A numerical study of singularity formation in an Euler model of shallow water wave propagation: the case of an ill-posed Boussinesq equation\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract We numerically study the issue of finite-time existence of solutions associated with the initial value problem (IVP) of an ill-posed Boussinesq equation subject to small-amplitude sinusoidal initial disturbances over a 2\\u03c0 periodic domain. A spectral method in combination with the fourth-order Runge\\u2013Kutta method is used to perform numerical experiments using several time steps, several precision arithmetic calculations and filters with several cut-off levels. The calculations indicate that the solution blows up in a very short time tc, the time of singularity formation. The value of tc changes very little with the filter cut-off level. To validate our numerical results, we also analyse the evolution of Fourier coefficients through a perturbation analysis taking into account that the perturbation parameter \\u03f5 (amplitude of the sinusoidal initial disturbance) is small. The location of the singularity where the solution blows up is found to be 3\\u03c0\\/2, independent of the parameter \\u03f5.

However, alteration of male sperm quality alongside age is not univocal between species, and this relationship remains largely elusive in bivalve molluscs. Here, we questioned whether ageing attenuates sperm motility and if telomere length (TL), a marker of individual quality, can further mark sperm performance in the Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas). We assessed covariation between sperm motility, age and TL in males (n = 45) from 2 to 9 years old. We replicated the measures at four reproductive sessions, corresponding to two types of maturation conditions (controlled in the lab or natural in the field). We found negative correlations between male age and sperm velocity, and slower sperm in natural conditions compared to controlled ones. TL did not shorten with age, but it was positively associated with sperm velocity while maturing under controlled conditions. Our results underscore that sperm swimming performance decreases with ageing, a relationship identified for the first time in a bivalve species. Further research is needed to understand environmental effects and the predictive aspects of telomere dynamics in covarying with sperm quality.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"Royal Society Open Science\",\"Author\":\"Konstantina C.

Here, mechanics equations are augmented to an Euler\\u2013Lagrange formulation, facilitating the study of blood flow in a pathological geometry during the cardiac cycle. The arterial morphology and pulse are represented by the transformation of the system of equations into a body-fitted approach via generalized curvilinear coordinates (GCCs). Dynamic three-dimensional (3D) governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are discretized with the finite-volume method (FVM) on a collocated grid. The results obtained with this mathematical model reveal that the pulsating wall influences the velocity field, with prominent recirculation zones. In addition, localized lateral pressure gradients are observed within the pathological region. Increased pulsatility causes large augmentations of the Reynolds and Womersley numbers, with divergence from the hydrodynamic case. Analysis of biomedical factors such as the time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) and oscillatory shear index (OSI) on the oscillating boundary provides valuable insight into the shear forces on the arterial wall compared with rigid wall dynamics.

Although international treaties and health recommendations call for banning hazardous pesticides, globally harmonized pesticide governance remains elusive. In Latin America (LATAM), the main net food exporter worldwide, agricultural pesticide use has increased by approximately 500% since 1990, compared with only approximately 3% in Europe. To assess the environmental and health rigour of LATAM\\u2019s pesticide legislation, we reviewed active ingredients (AIs) approved for ten major crops, and AIs banned at national level, in eight LATAM countries, assessed their hazardousness according to international standards, and legal status in the European Union (EU) and explored sources of variation in the number of AIs approved in LATAM. We identified 523 AIs approved and 236 banned in LATAM; approximately 50% of the approved and approximately 85% of the banned AIs in LATAM were either not approved or prohibited in the EU. Higher crop production and, to a lesser extent, export value were linked to more AIs approved in LATAM. These findings imply weaker regulatory frameworks for hazardous pesticides in LATAM, reflecting more permissive environmental policies compared with the EU.

This study examined how functional richness and functional redundancy influenced the stability of two key ecological functions\\u2014insect predation and seed dispersal\\u2014in forest bird communities with contrasting histories of cyclone exposure. Using total biomass of insectivores and frugivores as functional indicators, we found that the stability of insect predation increased with redundancy in function-delivering traits under cyclone disturbances, whereas the stability of seed dispersal was enhanced by redundancy in both function-delivering and response-related traits. In forests frequently exposed to cyclones, both functional groups occupied a smaller overall trait space, while frugivores showed greater trait similarity among individuals. These results suggest that the stability in insect predation and seed dispersal largely stems from the abundance of species performing similar functional roles. High cyclone frequency appears to exclude species with extreme traits and concentrate functional space around a few dominant species with convergent traits. Because such convergence buffers cyclone impacts, the loss of even a few redundant species could increase functional uniqueness and, consequently, reduce the functional stability of forest bird communities.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"BMC Surgery\",\"Author\":\"Junus, Katja\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Cites\":12,\"Cited by\":0,\"Related to\":0,\"Topic\":\"Emergency and Acute Care Studies\",\"Subfield\":\"Emergency Medicine\",\"Field\":\"Medicine\",\"Domain\":\"Health Sciences\",\"Open Access status\":\"gold\",\"DOI\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12893-026-03538-3\",\"Title\":\"Surveying prioritisation for emergency surgery - do the specialties involved agree?\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract Background Surgical resources are often shared across medical specialties, which can lead to conflicts over prioritisation during on-call hours. This study investigated factors contributing to inter-speciality conflict in the prioritisation of emergency surgical cases. Methods A survey on views of surgical urgency and prioritisation of 22 hypothetical cases was distributed to Swedish physicians involved in emergency surgery via posters in operating departments and administrative areas, and by email. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn\\u2019s post-hoc test were used to compare responses across specialties. Factors associated with daily conflicts were identified using logistic regression. Results Of 233 respondents, 201 (90%) reported sharing resources with other specialties. General surgeons (45%), orthopaedic surgeons (15%), and anaesthetists (15%) were the most represented. Over half reported insufficient resources for emergency surgery. Sixty-nine per cent perceived that other specialties over-prioritised their own patients. Thirty-nine respondents (17%) experienced daily conflicts over case prioritisation. Minor differences were observed in how respondents perceived their own prioritisation, that of other specialties, and the prioritisation of hypothetical cases. Daily conflicts were associated with concerns about compromised patient safety (odds ratio [OR] 8.05 and 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-63.5 for agreeing vs. strongly disagreeing\\/disagreeing), whereas greater perceived resource availability was associated with fewer conflicts (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.48\\u20130.96). Conclusions Perceived threats to patient safety and resource scarcity were associated with daily prioritisation conflicts. Although respondents frequently suspected over-prioritisation by other specialties, observed differences in prioritisation between the responsible specialty and others were small. Further research on shared prioritisation protocols and resource allocation, including international comparisons across health-care systems and cultures, is warranted.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"BMC Medicine\",\"Author\":\"Haussmann, Alexander\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Cites\":48,\"Cited by\":0,\"Related to\":0,\"Topic\":\"Cancer survivorship and care\",\"Subfield\":\"Oncology\",\"Field\":\"Medicine\",\"Domain\":\"Health Sciences\",\"Open Access status\":\"gold\",\"DOI\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s12916-026-04669-3\",\"Title\":\"Effects of aerobic or resistance exercise on sleep and cancer-related fatigue in patients with breast cancer during or after neoadjuvant chemotherapy: a 3-arm randomized controlled trial\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract Background The aim of this secondary analysis of the BENEFIT randomized controlled trial was to investigate the effects of aerobic training (AT) or resistance training (RT) during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) on sleep and cancer-related fatigue (CRF), compared to a waitlist control group (WCG) that performed RT after surgery. Methods In the BENEFIT study, 184 patients with breast cancer with scheduled NACT (mean age = 50 years, standard deviation = 11) were randomized to AT ( n = 62), RT ( n = 62), or WCG ( n = 60). While the AT and RT groups trained during NACT (two supervised and one home-based session weekly), the WCG completed the same training as the RT group but only after breast surgery. Self-reported sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) and CRF (EORTC QLQ-FA12) were collected before NACT (T0), after 9 weeks (T1), after NACT and before surgery (T2), 6 months after surgery (T3), and 12 months after surgery (T4). At T0, T2, and T3, sleep was additionally objectively measured by actigraphy. Results Longitudinal analyses of covariance examining changes from baseline suggested no clear difference of AT and RT compared to the WCG regarding sleep and CRF parameters post-intervention (T2). In contrast, at T3 the WCG, which exercised between T2 and T3, showed more favorable mean values compared to the AT group in total CRF (adjusted mean difference (AMD): \\u2212 10.53, 95% CI [\\u2212 19.63, \\u2212 1.42]) and physical CRF (AMD: \\u2212 14.28 [\\u2212 26.02, \\u2212 2.54] on 0\\u2013100 scale), and a tendency toward lower scores in self-reported global sleep quality (AMD: \\u2212 0.24 [\\u2212 0.48, 0.01] on log-transformed scale). Moderation analyses further suggested that group differences in total CRF at T3 in favor of the WCG were more pronounced among participants with at least mild emotional distress at baseline. There were no clear differences between groups in objective sleep parameters at T2 or T3, or regarding self-reported sleep or fatigue endpoints at T4. Conclusions The findings suggest that exercise interventions in the post-NACT phase may be more effective than during NACT for managing fatigue, while providing limited benefits for sleep.

Methods We analyzed the proteome of 244 patients and identified differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) with and without stage specificity across histotypes and constructed panels of DAPs to distinguish histotypes in both early and late stages. Survival analysis was performed to find proteins associated with clinical outcomes, and enrichment analysis was conducted to reveal biological processes connected to prognosis and the proteins involved.

Supervised aerobic exercise is a core intervention in cardiac rehabilitation, yet adherence and tolerance may be hindered by physical and motivational factors. Immersive technologies such as virtual reality (VR) have shown potential to increase engagement and positive perceptions during exercise. This study aims to evaluate the influence of VR on tolerance to cycle-ergometer aerobic exercise in hospitalized patients with HF. Methods We will conduct a randomized, controlled, parallel-group trial with 1:1 allocation. Adult inpatients with a diagnosis of HF will be screened for eligibility and randomly assigned to two groups: control (cycle-ergometer aerobic exercise) and intervention (the same exercise combined with an Meta Quest 2 VR device). Each participant will complete a single session of up to 20 min, consisting of five blocks of 3 min of continuous pedaling interspersed with one-minute passive rests, with early termination in case of intolerance. The primary outcome is effective exercise time (minutes) until interruption due to physical limitation or symptoms. Secondary outcomes include rating of perceived exertion, hemodynamic parameters, exercise enjoyment (PACES) and usability of the technology (SUS, intervention group only). Discussion This study will investigate whether VR can improve tolerance to aerobic exercise during hospitalization for HF, potentially providing preliminary evidence to guide the use of immersive technologies in cardiac rehabilitation. If benefits are observed, VR could be incorporated as a complementary tool to optimize adherence, motivation and safety in supervised exercise programs in this clinical context.

However, few studies have examined how the balance between these experiences influences outcomes. This study explores the predictive utility of a PCE:ACE ratio. Unlike previous measures of resiliency and risk protection scales that treat risk and protective factors as parallel dimensions, the ratio is population-level heuristic intended to capture the relative balance of positive versus adverse experiences using a single relational metric. Using data from a representative sample of 1,203 adults in Northern Ireland, participants completed validated measures of 13 ACEs and 10 positive childhood experiences (PCEs) A weighted PCE:ACE ratio was calculated, and participants were categorised into high, moderate, or low ratio groups. Results Findings showed that a higher ratio was significantly associated with reduced odds of arrest, incarceration, school exclusion, substance use, and mental health diagnosis, even after adjusting for age, gender, and deprivation. Those in the low-ratio group had the highest rates of adverse outcomes. While the ratio offers an intuitive and accessible framework for understanding developmental balance, limitations include the potential for oversimplification of distinct ACE-PCE profiles. Conclusions These findings support the feasibility of a ratio-based approach that standardises balance rather than the independent accumulation of risks and strengths, and suggests that a stronger balance of protective experiences may buffer the impact of adversity. Further research is needed to explore threshold effects and interaction dynamics. However, the ratio provides a useful metric and sound basis for capturing population health and the extent to which public investment is tipped in favour of positive or less positive outcomes.\"},{\"Year\":2026,\"Type\":\"article\",\"Source\":\"Journal of Intensive Care\",\"Author\":\"Hagiwara, Jun\",\"Language\":\"English\",\"Cites\":106,\"Cited by\":0,\"Related to\":0,\"Topic\":\"Cardiac Arrest and Resuscitation\",\"Subfield\":\"Emergency Medicine\",\"Field\":\"Medicine\",\"Domain\":\"Health Sciences\",\"Open Access status\":\"gold\",\"DOI\":\"https:\\/\\/doi.org\\/10.1186\\/s40560-026-00859-6\",\"Title\":\"Optimizing infection management after cardiac arrest: addressing diagnostic uncertainty and therapeutic dilemmas\\u2014a narrative review\",\"Publication date\":\"2026-01-28\",\"Abstract\":\"Abstract Infections are frequent after cardiac arrest and materially affect post-ICU care and outcomes. Diagnostic uncertainty is heightened by post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS)\\u2014hypoxic\\u2013ischemic brain injury, myocardial dysfunction, systemic ischemia\\u2013reperfusion injury, and immune dysregulation\\u2014and by sedation and targeted temperature management (TTM), which can mask clinical signs and modulate host defenses. Pneumonia predominates; bloodstream infection and intra-abdominal or hepatobiliary infections are under-recognized, especially in device-dependent or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)-treated patients. Conventional biomarkers such as C-reactive protein and procalcitonin show reduced infection specificity early after return of spontaneous circulation; therefore, single timepoint cutoffs are unreliable, and serial trajectories interpreted with clinical examination, microbiology, and imaging are preferred. Risk scores (e.g., Sequential Organ Failure Assessment [SOFA], Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score [CPIS]) may support stratification but are insufficient for definitive diagnosis. Observational cohorts report higher pneumonia rates with TTM, and temperature control can blunt fever and leukocytosis and alter cytokine and biomarker kinetics, complicating timely recognition. Prevention should emphasize protocolized bundles, including hand hygiene and asepsis, head-of-bed elevation, structured oral care per local policy, minimization of sedation with spontaneous breathing trials, and early removal of unnecessary devices, within an antimicrobial stewardship framework that supports early de-escalation once cultures and trajectories clarify etiology. Procalcitonin-guided early discontinuation reduces antibiotic exposure in general critical-care populations; in PCAS, use should prioritize serial trends integrated with clinical context rather than single thresholds. No fixed algorithm is prescribed; instead, practical considerations are presented to guide diagnostic practice, emphasizing early microbiological sampling and imaging, integration of serial biomarker trajectories with clinical assessment, and timely de-escalation as the clinical picture clarifies, without endorsing single-test cutoffs. Priorities include quantifying infection-attributable morbidity and mortality; developing and validating PCAS-specific biomarkers and composite decision tools, including electronic health record-based early warning models; evaluating short post-intubation prophylaxis in selected high-risk patients; optimizing TTM parameters (target temperature, duration, rewarming rate); and systematically characterizing under-recognized infections. A protocol-driven, multimodal program that integrates prevention, standardized diagnostics, and stewardship is required to deliver timely, appropriate therapy and improve outcomes after cardiac arrest.
