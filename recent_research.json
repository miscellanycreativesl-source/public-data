    "Abstract": "Despite the economic importance of lithium, there is considerable disagreement over the processes that concentrate it and other rare metals in pegmatite-type lithium deposits. Two main processes have been invoked, namely extreme differentiation of a peraluminous granitic magma and direct anatexis of a sedimentary protolith. We use geochemical modeling to quantify lithium enrichment via these two processes from a study of the Jiajika lithium pegmatite field, one of the largest of its type in the world. Based on a lithium–silicon–boron–barium (Li-Si-B-Ba) isotope study involving systematic sampling along 4,211-m of core from two deep boreholes and from the regional zonation of pegmatites at outcrops, we propose a three-stage model for the formation of the pegmatite field: i) generation of a rare metal-rich melt by deep anatexis, involving ~5% partial melting of metapelitic rocks in the presence of 10 to 30% metamorphic fluid; ii) gradual enrichment of rare metals along a path of continuous magma differentiation until 75% of the initial melt had crystallized; and iii) a final stage of lithium mineralization during the escape of the water-rich magma due to the overpressures created in response to massive fluid exsolution and the extensional stress in the granite dome structure. The study provides important insights into how lithium-rich pegmatites can be targeted during exploration for pegmatite-hosted resources of lithium.",

    "Abstract": "Genetic diversity, the fundamental substrate for evolutionary potential, is declining globally at unprecedented rates. Yet the mechanisms governing its distribution across species remain poorly understood, with competing hypotheses emphasizing either historical demography or contemporary ecological constraints. This debate limits our capacity to predict species' responses to environmental change. Here, based on systematic sampling and a unified analytical pipeline, we de novo assembled genomes for 120 songbird species breeding in the Himalayas–Hengduan Mountains (HHMs) and conducted population genomic analysis to examine the drivers of their genomic diversity. We observed a 6.5-fold variation in genome-wide heterogeneity and a 16.4-fold variation nucleotide diversity across species. Notably, these measures of genomic diversity showed no correlation with recent population dynamics, current population size, or other contemporary factors—such as elevational distribution, or life-history traits. Instead, historical demography strongly predicted genetic diversity, with ancestral population size during the late Pleistocene emerging as the sole correlate: Larger ancestral sizes consistently coincided with higher diversity. These findings underscore the critical influence of historical demography on contemporary genetic diversity in natural populations—an insight essential for designing effective conservation strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Antigenic variation in Trypanosoma brucei ( T. brucei ) requires monoallelic expression of one variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) from one of the subtelomeric bloodstream form (BSF) expression sites (BESs). This transcription is unusually mediated by RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) and occurs in a specialized nuclear body, the expression site body (ESB). While factors promoting active BES transcription and silencing inactive BESs are known, how these opposing activities are integrated remains unknown. Here, we identify ESBX (Tb927.3.1660) as a BSF-specific ESB protein necessary for this coordination. We show that ESBX RNAi knockdown prevents RNA Pol I localizing to the ESB and reduces active BES transcription, while also derepressing inactive BESs with low processivity transcription. Conversely, ESBX overexpression weakly activates inactive BESs in a distinct manner from ESBX knockdown, leading to processive transcription, without disrupting the active BES or forming supernumerary ESBs. ESBX knockdown causes a similar transcriptomic defect to ESB1 and VEX2 knockdown combined, establishing ESBX as a key factor linking transcriptional activation of the active BES with inactive BES silencing through the VSG exclusion (VEX) phenomenon. This allows us to suggest models for understanding the establishment and maintenance of monoallelic expression critical for parasite immune evasion.",

    "Abstract": "Two new species of Pyragraphorus Sproston, 1946 (Mazocraeidea: Pyragraphoridae) were collected from the gills of carangid fishes: Pyragraphorus rohdei n. sp. from Trachinotus baillonii (Lacépède) off Lizard Island, Queensland, Australia, and Pyragraphorus ningalooensis n. sp. from Trachinotus botla (Shaw) from Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, Australia, during June 2022 and March 2023. Pyragraphorus was reviewed, its diagnosis emended, and the new species described and compared with their congeners, Pyragraphorus pyragraphorus (MacCallum and MacCallum, 1913) Sproston, 1946, and Pyragraphorus hollisae Euzet and Ktari, 1970. The identification of specimens reported by Young as P. pyragraphorus from T. botla in Moreton Bay, Queensland, was corrected to P. ningalooensis. A phylogenetic hypothesis was reconstructed, on the basis of an analysis of partial 28S rDNA, including novel molecular data from the new species and from new collections of Heteromicrocotyloides megaspinosus Barton, Beaufrère, Justine, and Whittington, 2009, and Heteromicrocotyloides mirabilis Rohde, 1977 (both Heteromicrocotylidae) from Turrum fulvoguttatum (Forsskål), together with available comparable data for 76 other species representing 18 families of the order Mazocraeidea. The novel hypothesis indicated that the Pyragraphoridae and Heteromicrocotylidae, both characterized, in part, by species possessing fire-tongs-like haptoral clamps, originated independently in a larger, highly supported clade of the order that included species of the Heteraxinidae and the Microcotylidae. The Heteromicrocotylidae was found to be polyphyletic by Heterapta heterapta Unnithan, 1961, occurring independently of the 2 species of Heteromicrocotyloides. In addition, the Microcotylidae was recovered paraphyletic to the Pyragraphoridae and the Heteraxinidae was paraphyletic to the Heteromicrocotylidae. Other instances of para- and polyphyly among the familial and subfamilial taxa within the Mazocraeidea were suggested, but no family-group taxonomic changes were proposed.",

    "Abstract": "Polysaccharides exhibit remarkable stereochemical and regiochemical complexity, yet their natural heterogeneity produces differences in composition and material behavior that are difficult to control or predict. Here, we report a synthetic approach that overcomes these challenges through the controlled, cationic ring-opening polymerization of glucosamine-derived 2-oxazoline monomers, affording a new class of well-defined pseudo-polysaccharides, wherein each saccharide subunit is 1,2-<i>N</i>-linked through a nitrogen containing a pendant acyl group. Under optimized conditions using a benzyl-protected monomer (OBn-GlcOx) and a methyl tosylate initiator, polymerization proceeds to full conversion within 3 h at 75 °C with linear molecular weight growth, first-order kinetics, and low dispersity (D̵ ≤ 1.2), consistent with a controlled polymerization mechanism. The resulting polymers exhibit complete β-1,2-regio- and stereoselectivity, narrow molecular-weight distributions, and retention of chain-end functionality that enables chain extension to form diblock copolymers with 2-methyl-2-oxazoline. Following quantitative deprotection, the resulting polymer is water-soluble and both protected and nonprotected versions display markedly enhanced resistance to ultrasonic, acidic, and thermal degradation as compared to chitosan (mass loss ≤63% vs 93% under harshest conditions). These findings establish a synthetic route to stereoregular, amide-linked pseudo-polysaccharides with tunable physicochemical properties, expanding the accessible design space for well-defined, carbohydrate-based materials.",

Although distinct in their clinical presentations, they probably represent differential expressions of a dysregulated threat–response system. Here, we present a genome-wide association meta-analysis comprising 122,341 European ancestry ANX cases and 729,881 controls. We identified 58 independent genome-wide significant risk variants and 66 genes with robust biological support. In an independent sample of 1,175,012 self-report ANX cases and 1,956,379 controls, 51 out of the 58 associations replicated. As predicted by twin studies, we found substantial genetic correlation between ANX and depression, neuroticism and other internalizing phenotypes. Follow-up analyses demonstrated enrichment in all major brain regions and highlighted GABAergic signaling as one potential mechanism implicated in ANX genetic risk. These results advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of ANX and prioritize genes for functional follow-up studies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Humidity regulation plays a critical role in precision electronics, advanced storage, thermal, and energy management applications. While real‐time monitoring of water molecule dynamics during moisture sorption and desorption processes could provide crucial hygroscopic parameters for smart humidity regulation, conventional gravimetric methods suffer from low tracking speed, limited accuracy, and an inability to perform in situ detection. Here, we report a flexible hygroscopic electronics (FHE) capable of simultaneously regulating environmental moisture and dynamically monitoring sorption‐desorption processes through water‐mediated resistive changes in confined space. The targeted electronics exhibit exceptional performance, including a fast hygroscopic response of ∼2.1 s at 90% RH, cycling stability, and stable sorption‐desorption properties over more than 50 cycles. By engineering a series of modular array‐based sensors, we achieve adjustable humidity control in enclosed spaces according to application‐specific requirements. As a proof‐of‐concept, the intelligent electronic array successfully maintains stable humidity conditions even in damaged equipment enclosures (&gt;3.5 h) and provides rapid sensory alerts. This work establishes an intelligent core‐shell FHE system, that absorbs unexpected moisture through a bio‐based hygroscopic core and simultaneously monitors the water sorption/desorption behaviors by a thin conductive shell, which allows remote warning for potential seal risk of equipment in an early stage.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Electrochemical reduction of nitrate to nitrogen (N 2 ) offers a sustainable pathway to close the nitrogen cycle and mitigate nitrate pollution. However, for Cu, Co, and other transition‐metal catalysts, high N 2 selectivity has mainly relied on breakpoint chlorination, which consumes large amounts of chlorine and poses secondary contamination risks. Here, we introduce a surface‐oxophilicity strategy to steer the * N pathway, thereby enhancing both catalytic efficiency and intrinsic nitrogen selectivity. Among oxophilicity‐modified Pd, Sn doping emerged as the optimal configuration. The resulting PdSn metallene aerogels achieve remarkable NO 3 − ‐N conversion (∼97%) and N 2 selectivity (∼99%), together with long‐term stability (&gt;600 h) and broad tolerance to variable nitrate concentrations. In situ characterization and theoretical analyses reveal that Sn‐induced oxophilicity strengthens nitrogen‐oxygen intermediate adsorption, ensuring sufficient * N availability for N‐N coupling while elevating the hydrogenation barrier of * N → * NH, thus suppressing NH 3 formation. Integrated into a Zn‐NO 3 − battery and a customized gas‐integrated flow electrolyzer, the catalyst enables efficient nitrate removal and nearly complete N 2 selectivity, offering a promising platform for sustainable nitrogen recycling and energy conversion.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 27%, but further improvements of both PCEs and stability are needed for commercialization. One of the key factors hindering their development is the unpredictable residual strain in perovskites. The unstable octahedral structure of the perovskite cage leads to easy changes in bond lengths, bond angles, and crystal structure. It in turn generates, accumulates, and causes the non‐uniform distribution of residual strain, ultimately affecting device performance. Therefore, given the versatility and precise tunability, residual strain engineering provides an effective pathway to optimize the performance of PSCs. This review summarizes the causes of residual strain during device fabrication and operation, qualitative/quantitative/auxiliary characterization methods, and various effective strain regulation methods in the past two years. Finally, unresolved scientific issues and future research directions in strain engineering are discussed. This comprehensive review aims to provide researchers with the latest advances in strain engineering, deepen fundamental understanding of strain effects, and eventually help enhance the performance of PSCs.",

Here, based on a meta-analysis, we first show that treatment with nab-paclitaxel results in a higher overall response rate and pathological complete response compared to paclitaxel in female patients with breast cancer. Notably, TREM2 expression in macrophages is elevated in primary tumors of paclitaxel- but not nab-paclitaxel-treated female patients. In metastatic breast cancer, TREM2<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration is increased in primary tumors. In breast cancer models in female mice, paclitaxel, but not nab-paclitaxel, promotes lung metastasis by recruiting TREM2<sup>+</sup> macrophages to primary tumors. Mechanistically, paclitaxel enhances the ATF3-FGF2 axis in breast cancer cells; secreted FGF2 activates the EGR1-TREM2-EMT cytokine axis in macrophages. Genetic ablation of Trem2 or pharmacologic targeting with antisense oligonucleotides suppress paclitaxel-induced breast cancer lung metastasis in vivo.

Traditional therapies focus on individual factors in cartilage, synovium, or subchondral bone, limiting their ability to comprehensively address OA pathogenesis. In this study, a ROS/MMP13 dual-responsive organic selenium hydrogel microsphere (HSPHR) is developed to trigger a localized microenvironmental response specific to early OA by exploiting the disease’s pathological features. Simultaneously, the organic selenium component effectively enhances selenoprotein levels in cartilage, synovium, and subchondral bone, enabling multimodal treatment for osteoarthritis. HSPHR injections into joints reduce cartilage damage, synovial hyperplasia, and bone sclerosis in post-traumatic OA, while promoting new cartilage in defect models. It enhances selenoprotein synthesis and activates the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in key cells, improving mitochondrial function and antioxidant capacity, thus reversing OA-related changes. Here, we present a multimodal therapeutic strategy for OA lesions and reveal shared regulatory pathways among different cell types. This approach offers distinct insights for the multimodal treatment of degenerative joint diseases.",

This has mainly stemmed from the susceptibility of ferryl species to X-ray-induced electronic state changes. In this work we establishe using time-resolved serial femtosecond X-ray crystallography (tr-SFX) on a dye-decolourising peroxidase that the ferryl intermediate species (Compounds I and II) captured following in situ mixing of microcrystals with H 2 O 2 have single, rather than the double bond character expected. X-ray emission validated tr-SFX data with quantum refinement, time-dependent-DFT calculations and QM/MM geometry optimizations together support the concept that the single iron-oxygen bond character is not an indication of ferryl reduction or a protonated form (Fe IV -OH) but is instead attributed to the existence of accessible excited states possessing ferric-oxyl (Fe III –O •– ) character. Such states offer insight into the nature of ferryl heme.",

Traditional neuroimaging analysis often overlooks this temporal aspect, limiting insights into how functional network connectivity (FNC) supports ongoing cognition and behaviour. Using sliding window analysis, we captured FNC changes during tasks, reflecting network reconfiguration in cognitive processes. We further determined behavioural relevance of time-varying FNC by relating network measurements with task performances and psychopathology. We found that several whole-brain FNC patterns, or states, persist across resting and task-based fMRI, with state occurrences fluctuating with the most prominent task stimuli. Regional FNC distinguishes specific task conditions, and time-varying FNC explains more variance in psychopathology symptoms compared to static connectivity. These findings highlight that cognitive tasks reshape regional and whole-brain connectivity. By considering the different FNC states, time-varying connectivity provides a more comprehensive representation of brain interactions and thus may represent a better neural proxy for cognition and behaviour.",

This paper applies dynamic game-theoretic models to explore the interaction between the retailer’s information-sharing strategies and the manufacturer’s sales mode selections when the retailer introduces a private label. Through backward induction, the equilibrium strategies of both parties can be derived. The results show that the manufacturer consistently benefits from information-sharing under both sales modes, potentially achieving a win-win outcome under the agency selling mode. Improving the retailer’s information forecast accuracy encourages a shift from reselling to agency selling mode. The retailer’s lower information forecast accuracy or the smaller demand variance offers no first-mover advantage to either the manufacturer or the retailer. Additionally, an Information Compensation Mechanism (ICM) for revenue-sharing is proposed, and contract conditions across different sales modes are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "This paper proposes the PGD model for UAV path planning in complex terrain, addressing key challenges such as high-dimensional state processing, blind path exploration, and poor cross-scene adaptability. The PGD model integrates Transformer, GAN, and DDPG, forming a “compression-generation-optimization\" closed-loop system. The Transformer module compresses high-dimensional terrain data, alleviating training bottlenecks, while the GAN module generates high-quality candidate paths, reducing ineffective exploration. DDPG then optimizes the path planning strategy efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of PGD on the UAVDT (suburban) and AirSim (canyon) datasets. In terms of path length ( P l ), PGD achieves 20.0m/22.0m, compared to baseline models such as PPO-DRL (23.8m) and Soft Actor-Critic (24.0m). PGD also outperforms in collision rate ( C r ) with 2.5%/3.0% and computational efficiency ( T c ) with 13.5s/16.0s, respectively. The PGD model shows significant improvements in path planning efficiency and adaptability, particularly in high-complexity terrains. Compared to traditional models, PGD’s multi-module synergy enhances feature correlation and physical path constraints, offering a novel framework for intelligent planning in complex environments. Future work will focus on enhancing model adaptability to extreme weather and multi-agent collaborative scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Mutualistic interactions, where species reciprocally benefit from each other, are crucial for ecosystem stability and biodiversity. These interactions often involve species that experience different fitness effects for the traded resources or services. Because mutualisms rely on positive feedback between partners, such asymmetries can strongly influence evolutionary outcomes. Differences in fitness effects create divergent selective pressures, shaping trait evolution and determining the persistence of mutualisms. The strength of these effects can also vary depending on the availability of traded resources from other sources. Despite their importance, the evolutionary role of fitness asymmetries in mutualism has received little attention, beyond recognizing that some species may be more dependent on their partners than others. This study investigates how asymmetry in the fitness effects of a traded resource influences the persistence and phenotypic trait evolution of species in multi-mutualist guilds. To test this, we constructed synthetic multi-mutualist communities by combining, reproductively isolated and genetically modified strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that engage in a nutritional mutualism by trading adenine and lysine. One guild of four strains cannot produce lysine but overproduces adenine while the other guild cannot produce adenine but overproduces lysine. Lysine overproducers survive periods of low adenine better than adenine overproducers survive low lysine. Over a four-week evolution experiment we observed that strain persistence was strongly influenced by the availability of external resources. Communities in media containing traded resources supported the survival of all strains, whereas obligate conditions led to a significant extinction, especially for adenine overproducers. We observed distinct evolutionary trajectories of traits under obligate versus supplemented conditions. Phenotypic assays revealed that costs and benefits evolved differently depending on the essentiality of the traded resource and nutrient supplementation. These results demonstrate that asymmetries in the fitness effects of traded resources can influence evolutionary outcomes, species persistence, and community stability in multi-mutualist communities.",

    "Abstract": "The fuzzy fractional generalized FitzHugh-Nagumo differential equations (FFGFH-NDEs) is a well-known and generalized model that plays a significant role in biological systems, including complex synchronization in brain networks, cardiac dynamics, propagation of signals through nerve impulses, and digital circuit theory. The analytical study of the FFGFH-NDEs is more complex and difficult to deal with. An effective and efficient technique is required to solve FFGFH-NDEs analytically. This article introduces and investigates the analytical fuzzy solutions of FFGFH-NDEs using fuzzy fractional Caputo generalized Hukuhara ( FFCgH )-differentiability. The closed-form solutions of FFGFH-NDEs for various cases and types of FFCgH -differentiability are extracted for the homogeneous and nonhomogeneous case of the concerned model. The potential solutions are determined using fuzzy Laplace transform ( FLT ) and are presented in terms of multivariate Mittag-Leffler functions (MLFs). To highlight the innovation of this work, the digital memristor networks problem is designed and solved as an application of the proposed study including the graphical analysis to understand the uncertain behavior of the proposed model.",

    "Abstract": "The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region is one of the areas in China with the highest level of transportation integration, featuring a well-developed high-speed rail network, multimodal transport system, interconnected intercity bus services, and intelligent transportation platforms. These developments have brought about significant effects of time-space compression in the region. Under the effects of time-space compression, the changes in the regional socio-economic spatial structure are worth further exploration. To this end, from the perspective of accessibility, this study explores the time–space compression effect in the YRD region using models such as economic linkage strength (ELS), central city isochronous-ring, daily accessibility (DA), and employment accessibility (EA) indicators. The results show: (1) The time distance between central cities and prefectural-level and lower-tier cities has greatly decreased, resulting in a network-based structure and a trend towards urban system flattening; within 1–2 hours of central cities, the scale of the population, number of cities, and regional coverage area have rapidly expanded, promoting regional integration and urban agglomeration. (2) Intercity time-space compression has significantly increased the total ELS between cities, intensifying the “strong center” economic linkage pattern. The radiation and driving capacity of central cities for the region has notably increased, and the equilibrium of urban economic linkage capabilities has improved. (3) Time-space compression strengthens the “competitive-cooperative effect” of central cities, facilitating the convenient sharing and equalization of high-quality urban public services, but also leading to tensions in the supply and demand of these resources. (4) A high-accessibility region has formed in the “Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou” triangle, where high-accessibility cities possess larger market hinterlands and more employment opportunities, providing significant opportunities for the rise of small and medium-sized cities in peripheral areas. Based on these findings, in the context of time-space compression, these regions should actively build convenient, efficient, and resilient commuting and transfer networks. A networked spatial development strategy should be implemented, establishing efficient regional collaboration mechanisms and public service cooperation systems to promote coordinated regional development.",

    "Abstract": "The higher atomic mass of deuterium basically affects hydrogen-bonding interactions and solvent association, raising critical alarms about the precision of biomolecular measurements executed in heavy water. Herein, we combine linear infrared (IR) spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore how solvent isotopic exchange alters protein structure as well as dynamics. Comparative studies of different protonated (H<sub>2</sub>O, CH<sub>3</sub>OH) and deuterated (D<sub>2</sub>O, CD<sub>3</sub>OD) solvents expose noticeable differences in hydrogen-bond lifetimes, solvation patterns, and protein secondary structural constancy. Particularly, the amide I hydrogen-bonded complex shows suggestively longer lifetimes in D<sub>2</sub>O than in H<sub>2</sub>O, reflecting slower hydrogen-bond dynamics and reduced flexibility of the protein backbone. Similar effects are detected in methanol/methanol-d<sub>4</sub>, also highlighting that these phenomena are not unique to water but are intrinsic to deuterium replacement. These multitechnique results clearly validate that biomolecular structures and dynamical behaviors in deuterated solvents are markedly different from those in their protonated surroundings. Our conclusions extend the understanding of isotope substitution effects in solvation and underscore the necessity for careful interpretation of experimental data acquired in D<sub>2</sub>O or other deuterated solvents, mainly when concluding native biological conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Despite growing interest in online health communities (OHCs), prior studies report inconsistent findings regarding the factors that drive users' continuous engagement. Furthermore, little is known about the relative importance of these factors and their hierarchical interactions. To address these gaps, this study poses two research questions: What are the key determinants of continuous OHC usage, and how do these determinants interact within a hierarchical structure? We conducted a meta-analysis of empirical studies to extract 16 critical factors, and applied the FUZZY-DEMATEL-AISM method to construct a multi-layered framework capturing their interrelationships. The findings reveal that attitude functions as the most direct top-level determinant, while trust, perceived value, and self-efficacy serve as transitional drivers. In contrast, system quality, service quality, and technology anxiety form the foundational layer influencing user behavior. This study contributes to theory by elucidating the structural logic underlying OHC engagement and to practice by providing actionable insights for enhancing user retention and optimizing digital health platform design. The results offer a systematic roadmap for researchers and practitioners aiming to understand and improve sustained user participation in digital health communities.",

    "Abstract": "The persistent increase in healthcare expenditure has become a major challenge for the sustainability of public financing worldwide. Therefore, identifying the characteristics of at-risk population and their predictability for healthcare use is crucial to inform targeted policy and interventions to curb with increasing healthcare use and expenditure. Drawing on three waves of the HILDA survey that included a 'health module', the study applied four machine learning (ML) methods-Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and multilayer perceptron neural networks and conventional logistic regression for prediction of non-emergency healthcare use (specifically primary and tertiary inpatient hospital care). Predictive performance for the classifiers was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity measures, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Calibration of the models was assessed using Brier score, which measures the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes with lower values indicating better calibration. Finally, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) was conducted to explain the model's predictive behaviour, while SHAP results are provided for each wave along with a representative SHAP plot as a demonstration which uses the probability-contribution scale. Based on 47,899 observations and 741 variables, our model identified socio-economic factors (age, socio-economic status, private insurance status) and health-related variables (e.g. previous contact with healthcare service) and having a designated doctor to see when sick or for health advice were strong predictors of healthcare use. Between the different ML techniques, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees provided better prediction performance on healthcare use compared with logistic regression across all three waves. Although the standard logistic regression produced AUC of 0.69, had 71% positive predictive value (PPV), and 52% negative predictive value (NPV), with 86% sensitivity and 30% specificity, the ML models produced AUC in the range of 0.68 to 0.76, PPV of 75% to 77%, and NPVs of 61% to 63% with sensitivity ranging between 0.86 and 0.89, specificity between 0.40 and 0.44 and brier scores ranging between 0.11 and 0.28. The novelty of using ML techniques on a large, nationally representative longitudinal household survey data that covers a range of different domains provided more robust estimates on factors influencing future healthcare use (primary and inpatient elective care) which are important to inform resource allocation decisions and priority setting.",

    "Abstract": "Background Brucellosis, a neglected zoonotic disease as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), represents a substantial burden, causing both severe human morbidity and significant economic losses to the livestock industry. In recent years, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (Ningxia) in northwest China has emerged as a region with persistently high endemicity of human brucellosis. An in-depth analysis of the epidemic’s prevalence and spatiotemporal evolution in this region is essential to inform the optimization of targeted prevention and control measures. Methods Data on all human brucellosis cases from 2010 to 2024 were collected from the China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. Temporal trends, global and local spatial autocorrelation, and spatial scan statistics were used to explore temporal patterns, regional clustering, and high-risk areas. Results A total of 35 665 human brucellosis cases were reported in Ningxia, with no associated deaths, during the study period. The average annual incidence rates was 35.08/100,000, ranging from 3.31 to 84.80 per 100,000. Two incidence peaks were observed: the first in 2015 (43.66/100,000) and the second in 2022 (84.80/100,000). The human brucellosis incidence rates showed that overall increasing trend from 2010 to 2024 (average annual percentage change [AAPC]=18.31%, but this was not statistically significant (t = 1.63, P = 0.102). Male accounted for 71.01% (25 325 cases) of all cases, 2.45 times higher than females (28.99%, 10 340 cases). Cases were reported in all 22 counties of Ningxia. The top five counties with the highest average annual incidence were: Yanchi County (184.79/100,000), Tongxin County (75.91/100,000), Zhongning County (46.47/100,000), Xiji County (46.15/100,000) and Yuanzhou District (45.30/100,000), while Xingqing District had the lowest rate (5.60/100,000). The top five counties with the fastest AAPC were: Huinong District (AAPC = 140.46%), Qingtongxia City (AAPC = 127.19%), Pengyang County (AAPC = 111.19%), Haiyuan County (AAPC = 107.97%) and Lingwu County (AAPC = 102.04%). Global spatial autocorrelation analysis revealed spatial clustering of human brucellosis incidence between 2022–2024 (Moran’s I 0.266, p = 0.033; 0.394, p &lt; 0.001; 0.353,p = 0.002, respectively). Local spatial autocorrelation identified “high-high” clusters primarily in Zhongning County, Tongxin County and Lingwu County. Additionally, spatial scanning analysis detected four spatial clusters, including one most likely cluster (LLR = 6474.66, RR = 3.71, P ( 0.001) and three secondary clusters. The primary cluster center was located at Jingyuan County (38.10°N, 106.34°E), with a cluster radius of 271.44 km. Conclusion Our findings reveal a substantial burden of human brucellosis in Ningxia. The disease exhibits distinct seasonality, peaking in summer and autumn. Priority interventions should include: (1) Enhanced health education and targeted behavioral interventions for middle-aged and elderly males to improve personal awareness and competency in prevention and control; and (2) Timely identification of key risk factors and implementation of tailored prevention strategies in regions experiencing either a rapid increase or persistently high incidence.",
