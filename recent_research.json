    "Abstract": "Importance Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs) are associated with an increased long-term risk of cardiovascular disease, but the risks across different HDP subtypes, particularly those other than preeclampsia, remain unclear. Objective To examine whether the risk and distribution of specific cardiovascular outcomes differ across HDP subtypes. Design, Setting, and Participants This nationwide cohort study retrospectively analyzed women with deliveries in South Korea from 2010 to 2018 using the National Health Insurance Service database. HDPs were classified into 5 subtypes: chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, superimposed preeclampsia, preeclampsia/eclampsia, and unspecified hypertension. Events were verified through December 2022. Data were analyzed from June 1 to October 31, 2025. Exposures HDPs and their subtypes. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular events, including cardiovascular death, heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, and atrial fibrillation. Adjusted hazard ratios (AHRs) were estimated using Cox models accounting for age, cardiovascular comorbidities, demographic, lifestyle, and pregnancy-related factors. Results Among 570 843 women (mean [SD] age, 32.7 [4.0] years), 22 876 (4.0%) had HDPs. HDPs were associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events compared with women without HDPs (AHR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.49-1.76; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). The absolute risk increase was approximately 2.10 additional cardiovascular events per 1000 person-years over a median follow-up of 6.5 years (IQR, 4.7-8.7 years; incidence rate, 4.39 vs 2.29 per 1000 person-years). Among those with HDPs, 34.8% had gestational hypertension, 32.4% had preeclampsia or eclampsia, 17.7% had unspecified hypertension, 12.3% had chronic hypertension, and 2.8% had superimposed preeclampsia. All subtypes were independently associated with higher cardiovascular risk, with the highest risk observed in superimposed preeclampsia compared with women without HDPs (AHR, 2.93; 95% CI, 2.15-3.99; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). All subtypes were associated with increased risks of heart failure and stroke, and most subtypes were associated with higher cardiovascular mortality. Unspecified hypertension was associated with myocardial infarction, and chronic hypertension and unspecified hypertension were associated with atrial fibrillation. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, all HDP subtypes were associated with modest increases in long-term cardiovascular risk, except superimposed preeclampsia, which was associated with a markedly higher risk. These findings suggest that women with superimposed preeclampsia may benefit from closer postpartum cardiovascular surveillance.",

    "Abstract": "Importance Ipsilesional upper-limb motor deficits after stroke are functionally important yet largely neglected in rehabilitation. Remediation may improve motor outcomes in individuals with severe contralesional arm hemiparesis. Objective To determine whether training of the ipsilesional arm improves motor performance in chronic stroke with severe contralesional impairment and significant ipsilesional arm motor deficits. Design, Setting, and Participants This 2-site, parallel-group randomized clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment was conducted from February 2019 to August 2024, with follow-up through 6 months posttreatment. Data analysis was performed from August 2024 through August 2025. The trial was conducted at outpatient research laboratories at Penn State College of Medicine and the University of Southern California among adults with radiologically confirmed unilateral middle cerebral artery stroke, severe contralesional upper-extremity impairment (Fugl-Meyer score ≤28), and ipsilesional motor deficits. Participants were randomly assigned with equal probability to 2 treatment groups and stratified by sex. Interventions Participants were randomized to a 5-week, 15-session intervention focused on either the ipsilesional (n = 25) or contralesional (n = 28) upper limb. The ipsilesional group received ipsilesional virtual reality and manipulation training; the contralesional group received dose-matched, best practice contralesional arm therapy. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were ipsilesional motor performance (Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test [excluding writing]), functional independence (Barthel Index), contralesional impairment severity (Fugl-Meyer Assessment [Upper Extremity]), and perceived manual ability (ABILHAND-Stroke). Results Of 100 adults screened, 58 were included, and 53 participants (91%) completed both baseline and immediate posttreatment assessments. Of the 53 participants who completed the study, mean (SD) age was 59 (11) years, and 17 participants (32%) were female. In this modified intent-to-treat analysis, the ipsilesional treatment group showed significant improvement in Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test performance (mean difference, −5.87 seconds; 95% CI, −8.89 to −2.85 seconds; P = .003), representing a 12% reduction in time to completion. Relative to its own baseline, this improvement was sustained at the 3-week and 6-month follow-up times within the ipsilesional treatment group only. No significant effects were observed for the remaining outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance In this parallel-group randomized clinical trial, targeted ipsilesional arm training significantly improved ipsilesional motor performance in patients with chronic stroke with severe paresis. This approach may enhance functional capacity in patients who rely on the ipsilesional arm for daily activities. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03634397",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Reversible solid oxide cells (RSOCs) are promising for their highly efficient power‐fuel interconversion and serve as a critical technology for building a carbon‐neutral energy ecosystem. However, their widespread implementation is impeded by insufficient electrocatalytic activity and stability of conventional oxygen electrodes. Here, we design a high‐entropy single‐phase perovskite, Pr 0.2 Nd 0.2 Sm 0.2 Ba 0.2 Sr 0.2 CoO 3‐δ (PNSBSC), engineered from Sm 0.6 Sr 0.4 CoO 3‐δ (SSC), to overcome the classic activity‐stability trade‐off in perovskite oxides. A PNSBSC‐based button cell delivers a peak power density of 2.06 W cm −2 in fuel cell mode and a high current density of 2.54 A cm −2 at 1.3 V in electrolysis mode (50% H 2 O) at 800 °C. The cell also demonstrates exceptional stability, sustaining 120 h of continuous operation in both modes and three reversible cycles at 700 °C without performance degradation. Its scalability and robustness are further verified using a large‐area cell (30 W output, &gt;80 h stability) and by sustaining a notable 40 A electrolysis current at 1.3 V (80% H 2 O, 750 °C). First‐principles calculations corroborate the enhanced activity and stability, which are attributed to the high‐configurational‐entropy design. This work establishes entropy engineering as a viable paradigm for developing high‐performance and durable electrodes for advanced RSOCs.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT With the growing need for advanced wearable electronics and human‐machine interfaces, self‐powered pressure sensors have become increasingly important. In this regard, Piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs) offer an effective solution by converting mechanical stimuli directly into electrical signals, thereby eliminating the need for external power sources. In this study, we report a flexible, self‐powered pressure sensor based on ZrS 2 ‐embedded PVDF/PPy nanofibers fabricated via electrospinning. Hydrothermally synthesized ZrS 2 nanoparticles are incorporated as functional fillers, and their spherical morphology is confirmed through transmission electron microscopy, while X‐ray diffraction verifies their crystalline structure. The addition of ZrS 2 nanoparticles significantly enhances the piezoelectric properties of the polymer matrix by promoting the formation of the β‐phase, as evidenced by Fourier‐transform infrared spectroscopy. The PENG is fabricated by sandwiching a nanofiber mat containing 0.3 wt.% ZrS 2 and 0.1 wt.% PPy/PVDF between two copper electrodes, with a polyimide tape layer added around the sensor for passivation and mechanical protection. Under finger‐tapping, the PENG generates open‐circuit voltage of 52 V and short‐circuit current of 0.6 µA. The piezoelectric charge coefficient is measured at 18.8 pC/N, confirming effective stress‐to‐ charge conversion. Furthermore, power density is calculated as 0.9 µW/cm 2 at an external load of 60 MΩ. Notably, the PENG‐based pressure sensor exhibits long‐term durability, retaining stable output over 10,000 mechanical loading cycles, and offers a quick response time of 1 ms. These results highlight sensor's reliability for self‐powered operation and its suitability for wearable electronics, further validated through real‐time demonstrations in activity monitoring, human‐machine interfaces, and smart glove‐assisted industrial tasks.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Ethane chlorination has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional ethylene‐ and acetylene‐based routes for the production of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). Unlike conventional catalytic processes, this approach relies on chlorine radical‐mediated activation to convert ethane into 1,2‐dichloroethane, followed by thermal cracking to VCM. However, this route remains in its early stages, hindered by the complexity of gas‐phase radical chemistry and catalyst deactivation under chlorination conditions. This review provides a critical assessment of the mechanistic foundations of ethane chlorination, highlighting the interplay between radical‐mediated and surface‐catalyzed pathways. Particular attention is given to advances in rare‐earth oxychloride catalysts, which have shown the ability to stabilize key intermediates. We also discuss major deactivation mechanisms, including phase transformation and surface hydroxylation, that limit catalyst lifetime. Furthermore, we highlight the feasibility of ethane chlorination as a low‐carbon VCM production route under future decarbonized energy scenarios. Finally, key directions in catalyst design, mechanistic understanding, and process integration are outlined to advance ethane chlorination from laboratory‐scale innovation to industrial reality.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT A metal‐organic cage was obtained by combining acridone‐based dipyridyl ligands with Pd 2+ ions. The cage acts as a potent receptor for squaraine dyes, with a pronounced preference for guests with 2,6‐dihydroxyphenyl substituents. This selectivity profile differs from that of previously reported receptors for squaraine dyes. The acridone‐based cage itself is non‐emissive. Upon its photoexcitation, ultrafast (sub‐ps) dark resonance energy transfer (DRET) to the encapsulated squaraine dyes was observed, resulting in bright, near‐infrared guest emission, with pseudo‐Stokes shifts of up to 440 nm. Upon binding of a chiral dye, chirality transfer to the host could be evidenced by circular dichroism spectroscopy.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Tin oxo clusters (TOCs) have been recognized as the most promising photoresist candidates for high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (High‐NA EUV) lithography. To enhance the adhesion between the exposed cluster species and the silicon dioxide substrate, herein, we incorporate silane moieties to functionalize the surface of TOCs for the first time. By synergistically integrating the high radiation sensitivity of Sn and substrate affinity of Si, ultrahigh resolution patterning at the sub‐8 nm scale has been successfully achieved, which represents the best performance in TOC photoresists. Multiple spectroscopic analyses and theoretical calculations on reaction mechanisms indicate that the incorporated Si moieties function dually by capturing scattered secondary electrons (SEs) to produce silyl radicals that guide the formation of dense Si‐O‐Si structure, while simultaneously enhancing interfacial adhesion to the SiO 2 substrate. Such a synergistic process yields diverse and abundant Sn‐O‐Sn/Sn‐O‐Si/Si‐O‐Si networks, collectively realizing higher resolution and lower line‐edge roughness (LER). This work not only introduces a new family of Sn‐Si oxo cluster resists but also demonstrates the potential of atomic‐level interfacial engineering for next‐generation ultrahigh‐resolution semiconductor manufacturing technologies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Protein aggregation poses a significant risk to biopharmaceutical product quality, as even minor amounts of oligomeric species can compromise efficacy and safety. Rapid and reliable detection of protein aggregates thus remains a major challenge in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Although traditional offline methods such as size‐exclusion chromatography provide accurate results, their inherent time delays limit real‐time process control capabilities. Consequently, there is an urgent scientific need for inline analytical techniques capable of selectively quantifying protein monomers and aggregates in real time to facilitate immediate corrective actions and enhance overall process robustness. Raman spectroscopy, as a tool for a process analytical technology application, is especially suitable due to its molecular specificity, rapid data acquisition, and compatibility with aqueous solutions commonly used in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Addressing this need, this study establishes a Raman spectroscopy‐based strategy for the selective detection and quantification of monomeric and aggregated forms of a model protein (bovine serum albumin). Controlled stress conditions were applied to generate aggregated species reproducibly, and a Latin Hypercube sampling design was used to independently vary protein concentration and aggregate fraction, ensuring that observed spectral effects were attributable to aggregation rather than concentration differences. Furthermore, spectral markers identified in spectra acquired from multiple chromatographic runs were qualitatively compared with offline reference measurements from size‐exclusion chromatography. This limitation in real‐time applicability was circumvented by chemometric machine learning approaches. The use of convolutional neural networks enabled the selective quantification of the protein monomers and aggregates and delivered superior predictive performance and robustness across cross‐validation, independent testing, and synthetic perturbation scenarios compared to traditional chemometric approaches. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the selected Raman spectral markers, combined with advanced chemometric modeling, enable reliable, real‐time monitoring of protein size variants in biopharmaceutical downstream processes.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Sustainability is a major requirement in resource‐intensive industries, and the proposed study seeks to understand the role of different leadership orientations and government policy in green supply chain adoption (GSCA) and circular economy practices (CEP) in the Chinese furniture industry. The study conceptualizes the concepts of corporate social responsibility (CSR) leadership, ethical leadership, green transformational leadership and digital leadership as internal drivers and government policy as an external institutional driver, using Upper Echelon Theory and Institutional Theory. GSCA is considered a key mediator variable, and government policy is also a moderator. The sample involved 447 managers and senior employees and was analyzed using partial least‐squares structural equation modeling (PLS‐SEM). Empirical results show that each of the leadership orientations has a strong positive impact on both GSCA and CEP; government policy has a direct positive impact on GSCA and has a significant amplification effect on ethical leadership, digital leadership and green transformational leadership. Furthermore, GSCA mediates the interaction of leadership orientations and government policy into circular economy results, thus proving that effective leaders and enabling institutional governance enhance the speed of sustainability transitions. The research also contributes to the literature by applying the theories of the Upper Echelon and Institutional to the realm of resource‐heavy industries and provides practical advice to managers and policymakers seeking to facilitate the implementation of circular economy projects.",

    "Abstract": "The mutualistic interaction between truffle‐like ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi and mycophagous mammals is fundamental to forest health, supporting fungal dispersal, soil structure, nutrient cycling, and plant community dynamics worldwide. However, climate change may disrupt this mutualism in unprecedented ways by altering truffle‐like ECM sporing body production and mycophagous mammal diets, with consequences for fungal spore dispersal and ECM host plant health. As one of the most specialised mycophagous mammals in the world, the endangered marsupial long‐footed potoroo Potorous longipes provides a powerful model system to investigate these risks. Using a unique 23‐year collection of long‐footed potoroo scats from south‐eastern Australia, we quantified the diversity and composition of truffle‐like ECM fungi in their diet and assessed how it was shaped by intra‐ and inter‐annual shifts in temperature and precipitation. ITS2 metabarcoding of scats revealed a high richness of truffle‐like ECM fungi in long‐footed potoroo scats, with a total of 38 taxa from 14 genera. The richness of truffle‐like ECM fungi consumed by long‐footed potoroos was negatively correlated with higher minimum temperatures of the previous quarter and 12 months, and was highest in spring. Seasonality, precipitation, minimum temperature and aridity were the best predictors of truffle‐like ECM fungal community composition in long‐footed potoroo scats. We found that five truffle‐like ECM fungal genera – Mesophellia , Hysterangium, Arcangeliella, Thaxterogaster and Austrogautieria – were associated with specific climate conditions related to temperature and precipitation, providing novel insights into their phenology and dispersal. Our findings suggest that mycophagous mammals may consume far less diverse fungal diets in a warmer and drier future, with a greater reliance on truffle‐like ECM fungal genera associated with these conditions such as Mesophellia . These results highlight the sensitivity of this mutualism to climate variability and change, with implications for long‐footed potoroo nutrition, dispersal of truffle‐like ECM fungi, and ecosystem functioning.",

Initially dominated by dairy‐based products, the growing prevalence of lactose intolerance and environmental concerns has spurred innovation in non‐dairy probiotic alternatives, including fruit juices, cereals, and plant‐based matrices. Probiotics exhibit diverse health‐promoting mechanisms, such as competitive exclusion of pathogens, production of antimicrobial compounds, and enhancement of nutrient bioavailability. Recent advancements in biotechnology, including CRISPR‐engineered strains, microencapsulation, omics technologies, and AI‐driven optimization, are the potential of applications probiotic applications, enabling more precise strain selection and improved viability. While some of these technologies are at the proof of concept stage, their future translation to the food market will require navigating regulatory pathways and addressing consumer acceptance. Beyond health benefits, probiotic foods contribute to sustainable food security by reducing food waste, enhancing nutritional value, and supporting circular economy models through waste upcycling and lower environmental impact. However, challenges such as strain viability, regulatory harmonization, and scalability in developing countries like Ethiopia's Tigray, where indigenous fermented foods remain understudied, must be addressed.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background and Objectives The proportion of free‐standing hospitals is rapidly declining in favor of healthcare systems. We aim to compare outcomes after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) between hospital volume and surgeon volume within consolidated healthcare systems. Methods Utilizing New York State's SPARCS database, we identified adults undergoing PD (2016–2019) at flagship (highest volume within a system) or non‐flagship hospitals. Analysis compared 30‐ and 90‐day outcomes by hospital and surgeon annual volume (hospital volume ≥ 20 vs &lt; 20PD/yr and surgical volume ≥ 10 vs &lt; 10PD/yr). We controlled for patient self‐selection across surgeons and facilities using propensity‐score matching. Results Among 1633 patients, 68.8% were treated at flagship hospitals. Compared to patients treated at non‐flagship hospitals, those at flagship hospitals had lower median postoperative length of stay (8‐days vs. 10‐days, p &lt; 0.01), fewer transfusions (17% vs 29%, p &lt; 0.01), other post‐procedural (8.1% vs 12.6%, p = 0.02), and overall complications (53% vs 59%, p = 0.07). The lowest overall complications and length of stay ( p &lt; 0.05) were observed at high‐volume hospitals regardless of surgeon volume. Conclusions More favorable outcomes among pancreatoduodenectomy patient were observed at high‐volume flagship hospitals. When planning a complex surgery, patients should be referred to the highest volume hospital within their healthcare system to optimize post‐operative outcomes.",

Addition of RNAlater‐ICE to banked rat IVD samples yielded a mean RIN of 8.2 and 7.6 for NP and AF tissues, respectively. Conclusions This study describes methods that reproducibly generate high‐quality RNA from freshly dissected and stored IVD tissues from mice and rats. Notably, we highlight a method using RNAlater‐ICE to yield high‐quality RNA from banked rat IVD tissues. These methods will ensure reproducible molecular assessment of rodent IVD tissues to improve our understanding of IVD biology.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This study investigates the removal of Congo red (CR) dye from aqueous solutions using synthetically prepared SnO 2 /ZnO/Fe 2 O 3 nanocomposite (SnZnFeONPs). The structural properties of the nanocomposites were characterized using SEM, EDX, FTIR, and XRD techniques. The effects of key parameters, including initial CR dye concentration, pH, ultrasound duration, and adsorbent dosage, on dye removal efficiency were systematically evaluated. Under optimized conditions, an adsorption efficiency exceeding 97% was achieved. Equilibrium data fitted the Langmuir model best ( R 2 = 0.996) with a Q max of 344.82 mg g − 1 , indicating monolayer adsorption of CR molecules. However, the Freundlich model ( R 2 = 0.968) also suggested some degree of surface heterogeneity and possible multilayer interactions. Kinetic studies indicated that the adsorption process followed a pseudo‐second‐order (PSO) model. Computational simulations revealed that CR molecules adsorbed in a parallel orientation on the nanocomposite surface. Thermodynamic analysis indicated that the adsorption process is exothermic and primarily governed by physical interactions. The adsorption intensity values (n) at 25°C, 35°C, and 45°C were 0.599, 0.593, and 0.563, respectively, all less than 1, confirming favorable adsorption. Furthermore, the saturation adsorption capacity (Q s a t ) decreased from 438.465 mg g − 1 at 298 K to 34.633 mg g − 1 at 318 K, indicating reduced interaction at higher temperatures. These findings suggest that SnZnFeONPs exhibit excellent potential for efficient CR dye removal from industrial effluents through adsorption.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT ‐Alkyl formates are considered as potential alternative fuels or fuel additives. While their oxidation chemistry has been investigated intensely, their pyrolysis chemistry requires more experimental insights. The present work utilizes shock tube experiments in combination with infrared laser absorption measurements to obtain information about the ‐alkyl formate dissociation and to derive rate coefficients. These experiments are complemented with kinetics predictions. Methyl formate is found to be less reactive than the longer n ‐alkyl formates, the latter of which have rather similar rate coefficients for dissociation towards n ‐alkene and formic acid, with n ‐butyl formate exhibiting the largest rate coefficient. The present experimental rate coefficients for n ‐alkyl formate decomposition are found to agree well with experimental results from the literature. The decomposition of formic acid formed via dissociation of the longer n ‐alkyl formates, the present experimental rate coefficient was initially assumed to deviate from theoretical predictions found in the literature. Yet when adjusting the collisional energy transfer parameters in the kinetics predictions, the present results can be reproduced through previous theoretical work. This indicates that formic acid might be very sensitive to the bath gas, which will be investigated in future work. With the present systematic investigation of to n ‐alkyl formates, detailed chemical kinetic modeling of ‐alkyl formates will be aided in general. Moreover, the potential to gain insights at the elementary reaction level is revealed in the context of formic acid dissociation.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The activation of autophagy in endothelial cells is a key mechanism underlying vascular remodeling, leading to the development and progression of pulmonary hypertension (PH). In our previous studies, we developed ROC‐325, a novel lysosomal autophagy inhibitor, and demonstrated its potent therapeutic effects in severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, its role in chronic hypoxia‐induced PH (HPH) remains unknown. Here, we observed increased LC3B‐II/I and decreased p62/SQSTM1 in lung tissues of hypoxic mice, indicative of autophagy activation. ROC‐325 treatment suppressed this activation by inhibiting LC3B‐II accumulation and restoring p62 levels. ROC‐325 significantly reduced right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), and pulmonary artery medial thickening and muscularization, indicating a significantly protective effect against HPH. Endothelial hypoxia‐inducible factor 2α (HIF‐2α) upregulation, resulting from prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) deficiency, was implicated in autophagy activation. Endothelial conditional PHD2 knockout mice, a spontaneous PH model, exhibited elevated LC3B‐II/I and HIF‐2α levels, both of which were reduced by ROC‐325, leading to significant PH attenuation. In vitro, ROC‐325 inhibited the proliferation of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells derived from PHD2‐deficient mice and enhanced HIF‐2α degradation in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells. These findings, in summary, identify ROC‐325 as a promising therapeutic agent for hypoxia‐induced PH by modulating both autophagy and endothelial HIF‐2α signaling.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aims Nocturnal enuresis (NE), daytime urinary incontinence (DUI), and fecal incontinence (FI) and functional constipation (FC) are common functional disorders in childhood, which can persist into adolescence and adulthood. The aim of this paper is to review evidence of risk factors that impede the attainment of bladder/bowel control and contribute towards the persistence of incontinence, and to outline protective factors towards minimizing long‐term negative sequelae. Methods A think tank group consisting of multidisciplinary experts at the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society (ICI‐RS) in 2025 reviewed evidence of factors influencing the attainment of bladder and bowel control, the continuation of incontinence into adolescence and adulthood and the subsequent negative sequelae. Both prospective and retrospective views were considered. Open questions and future directions were discussed. Recommendations for future research and for the improvement of clinical practice in in children, adolescents and adults were formulated. Results Childhood incontinence can continue into adolescence and adulthood and is associated with medical and mental health risks. Genetic and environmental risk factors have been identified, but their interaction with protective factors has not been studied. Potentially important environmental risks that require further research include late toilet training, prolonged use of disposable diapers, excessive use of digital media and lack of transitional care from pediatric to adult services. Studies on prevention on all levels (universal, selective and indicated) are lacking. Conclusions As childhood incontinence is a precursor of adult incontinence in many patients, early preventive measures are needed. Future research should focus on identifying risk and protective factors. Improved collaboration and exchange between pediatric services and adult urology is essential.",

    "Abstract": "To accurately predict how organisms and ecological communities will respond to future conditions caused by climate change, we must consider the temporal dynamics of environmental stressors, including the effects of repeated exposures to stress. We performed a two‐year passive thermal manipulation in coastal British Columbia, Canada to determine how intertidal communities responded to single and successive warm summers. Warm temperatures had both negative contemporaneous effects within years and persistent negative effects across years. Warming reduced organism densities, altered population dynamics, and affected community structure and diversity, patterns which were likely mediated by differences in foundation species (barnacle) abundance between treatments. Unexpectedly, the effects of warming in the second year were rarely dependent on whether temperatures were warm during the first year (i.e. no interactive effect). Our study suggests that, while this intertidal community can recover from single warm summers, recurring warming has additive negative effects, resulting in a more depauperate, less diverse community over time, particularly if foundation species are negatively affected.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Epoxy resins (EPs) have long served as a key dielectric material for electrical insulation in high‐voltage systems. However, the increasing demand for higher reliability, superior insulating performance, and long‐term stability under complex operating conditions has driven intensive efforts toward material innovation. Among various strategies, the incorporation of functional fillers to form polymer composites has proven especially promising. This review synthesizes recent progress in the design, characterization, and understanding of EP‐based composites for high‐voltage insulation. We first summarize the diverse classes of fillers, ranging from microscale to nanoscale, and analyze how their morphology, dispersion, and interfacial engineering contribute to enhanced dielectric strength and charge transport control. The underlying mechanisms governing trap formation, breakdown behavior, and electrical conduction are discussed in detail through both experimental observations and theoretical models. In addition to experimental advances, we highlight the growing role of computational methods in revealing interfacial phenomena and guiding material optimization. The review concludes by outlining practical applications, identifying current challenges that limit large‐scale implementation, and proposing key research directions for next‐generation high‐performance EP‐based insulating materials.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND Selecting an optimal spray configuration in arable crops is complex due to the large variety in techniques, nozzle types, crop stages, and pathogens. This complexity is further increased by regulatory requirements for drift reduction, which restrict the range of configurations that can be applied. To support informed decision‐making, this study examined droplet deposition and coverage in winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) using drift‐reducing spray configurations. RESULTS Seven configurations were tested in field trials over two growth stages (mid and late) and 2 years (2023 and 2024), combining application techniques (standard boom, air support, Wingssprayer, reduced boom height) with nozzle types (standard flat fan nozzles with 0%, 50%, and 90% drift reduction, and a dual fan nozzle). Deposition and coverage were quantified using artificial collectors and tracer analysis. A significant interaction was observed between spray configuration and collector position at both growth stages ( P &lt; 0.001). Drift‐reducing configurations performed similarly to the reference application which used a fine‐quality standard flat fan nozzle (XR 110 03, 300 kPa, 0.5 m nozzle height and spacing). CONCLUSION Spray configuration had a negligible effect on the relative spray deposition at the different collector positions in winter wheat, except at the spike and at the ground level. The results indicate that spray applications in winter wheat require optimizations tailored to the specific target location within the canopy, rather than a uniform approach. Air support combined with a fine spray quality nozzle appears particularly promising in improving deposition without compromising drift reduction. © 2026 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Excitation and de‐excitation processes of semiconductor quantum dots have been extensively studied for decades. In comparison to the traditional chalcogenide nanocrystals (NCs), some of the optical features are reported to be different for the recently emerged halide perovskite NCs. Defect states, ligand effects, doping, and the temperature‐tuned excited‐state decay processes remained unique in these NCs. Combining all these parameter variations, the photophysical chemistry of the photo‐excitation and relaxation processes is reported in this review. It begins with the discussion of the color tunability of NCs with halide composition variations and their decay lifetimes. Further, the impact of temperature and the relaxation processes of these NCs are correlated. In addition, the impact of size, shape, facets, and surface ligands, doping of Mn(II) and other ions for the change in photoluminescence and excited decay lifetimes are studied and reported. This information is the fundamental insight related to the photophysical processes of halide perovskites, where doping as well as temperature impact differ to the traditional quantum dots. Hence, this Review is expected to bridge the understanding of quantum dots’ photophysical processes from chalcogenides to halide perovskites and helps for designing optimization of stable and highly emissive semiconductor NCs.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Employee self‐perceived competencies have been shown to affect numerous facets of employment, such as employee career mobility, willingness to learn, and job satisfaction, yet little is known about the contributors to these self‐perceptions in logistics/supply chain management (L/SCM) employees. Using data from 339 employees who graduated within the last 5 years from L/SCM programs, we explore the impact of learning modality (online vs. face‐to‐face), academic performance, age, and gender on employee self‐perceptions of functional logistics knowledge, logistics‐related technology skills, and managerially relevant soft skills. Findings reveal that for employees in logistics management roles, face‐to‐face learning (vs. online learning) enhanced self‐perceived soft skills but had no significant impact on logistics knowledge or technology skills. Conversely, employees in logistician roles reported higher self‐perceived competencies across all areas when learning face‐to‐face. For employees in both roles, academic performance positively influenced knowledge and technology skills but not soft skills, while age differentially affected competencies across roles. The results underscore the need for L/SCM programs to optimize learning across modalities and integrate soft skills training to better prepare graduates for diverse professional challenges.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Agroforestry systems are well known to improve soil health, biodiversity, and mitigate climate change by sequestering soil organic carbon (SOC). Nevertheless, the carbon stabilization and permanency over time under multi‐species agroforestry designs are yet to be fully explored. This article presents a bio‐inspired spider‐web agroforestry design, conceptualized on the basis of radial and spiral geometry of the spider web, to optimize the space, species interactions, and stabilization of carbon in soil. The framework combines various trees and crops in triangular and radially attached forms to further mixed litter inputs, constant rhizodeposition, and improved soil aggregation. To assess its carbon sequestration capability, we integrate empirical data on long‐term agroforestry research with a RothC‐based soil carbon dynamics modeling framework. The current strategy contrasts with other standard RothC applications, which are designed to be used with systems that are uniform in nature, since a simplified active‐slow passive pool structure and parameterization specific to the design is used to model the biologically complex processes that typify spider‐web agroforestry. Carbon loadings, decay process, and inter‐pool transfer processes were modeled over 20 years with the same climatic and initial SOC conditions in a traditional agroforestry baseline and spider‐web setup. The uncertainty in carbon inputs and turnover parameters was taken into consideration in the Monte Carlo simulations carried out in Python. According to model projections, spider‐web design will outperform conventional agroforestry in terms of SOC stocks, which are due to better stabilization of slow and passive carbon pools as compared to temporary accumulation of carbon on the surface. The increased potential of spider‐web configuration as the best sequestration device can be further supported by statistical analyses and comparative projections. The proposed design is not a fully calibrated biophysical model; it gives a reproducible framework of the relationship between agroforestry spatial design and long‐term soil carbon dynamics.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a group of rare autoimmune diseases characterized by pauci-immune necrotizing inflammation of small to medium-sized blood vessels, in which ANCAs targeting neutrophil antigens promote neutrophil activation, endothelial injury and organ damage. Although AAV follows a relapsing-remitting course, the immune landscape during remission remains poorly defined. This study investigated leukocyte alterations across AAV subtypes and examined whether plasma from ANCA-positive and ANCA-negative eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) patients in remission modulates peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses in healthy donors (HDs). Methods Peripheral blood was collected from 62 AAV patients in remission and 28 age- and sex-matched HDs. Leukocyte morphology was assessed via May-Grünwald Giemsa staining. Circulating cytokines and chemokines were quantified by ELISA. HD-derived PBMCs were exposed to plasma from EGPA patients, antiphospholipid-positive controls, or HDs. Cell death, metabolic activity, and cytokine production were evaluated using Trypan Blue, Annexin V/PI staining, MTT assays, and ELISA. Chemotaxis assays assessed cell migration in response to conditioned media, with or without Anakinra or CCR1 inhibitor J113863. Results AAV patients showed increased immature neutrophils. Plasma from ANCA-positive EGPA patients induced PBMC death, inflammasome-related cytokine release, and secretion of chemotactic and proangiogenic factors. Conditioned media enhanced immune cell migration in a cytokine-dependent manner. Conclusion These findings indicate persistent subclinical immune activation during AAV remission, particularly in ANCA-positive EGPA, suggesting a role for mononuclear cell-mediated inflammation in relapse risk and the potential utility of immune monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Prosaposin (PSAP), a highly conserved lysosomal protein and precursor of saposins A–D, has emerged as a key regulator of cellular and central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis. Disrupted PSAP trafficking may lead to amyloid protein aggregation with implications for neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD), PSAP shows altered expression patterns and pathological co-localization with amyloid aggregates. PSAP variants are linked to multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including synucleinopathies, Gaucher’s disease, and metachromatic leukodystrophy. Its levels are elevated in blood and cerebrospinal fluid in some individuals with AD or PD and are upregulated by stress conditions such as nerve injury and cold adaptation, but not by exercise. Prosaptides, short peptides derived from PSAP, show protective effects in models of oxidative stress, CNS injury, and metabolic disorders. Pharmacological stabilization of PSAP interactions with progranulin has shown promise in neurodegenerative disease models. These findings suggest PSAP plays an important role in maintaining brain health and may hold therapeutic potential. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of PSAP’s role in CNS health and disease, metabolic stress, and exercise adaptation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We study how religious competition—defined as the entry of a religious organization with innovative worship practices into a predominantly Catholic municipality—affects domestic violence. Using municipality-level data from Colombia and a two-way fixed effects design, we find that the arrival of the first non-Catholic church leads to a significant reduction in reported cases of domestic violence. We argue that religious competition incentivizes churches to adopt and diffuse norms and practices that more effectively discourage such violence. Effects are largest in municipalities with smaller, younger, and more homogeneous populations—contexts that facilitate both intense competition and norm diffusion. Consistent with this mechanism, areas with more new non-Catholic churches exhibit greater rejection of domestic violence, particularly among the religiously observant, and higher female labor force participation. These findings contribute to the literature on the cultural determinants of domestic violence by identifying religious competition as a catalyst for cultural change.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study investigated lacosamide (LCM), a third-generation antiepileptic drug, as a potential gonadoprotective agent against cyclophosphamide (CP)-induced testicular injury. The research addressed the critical need for safer antiepileptic alternatives in cancer patients requiring concurrent chemotherapy and seizure control. Male Wistar rats underwent comprehensive biochemical and histopathological analyses including Western blot, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, steroidogenic enzyme activity assessments, sexual hormone measurements, sperm quality evaluations, and molecular docking studies to evaluate LCM's protective mechanisms against CP-induced testicular damage. CP administration significantly elevated oxidative stress markers, pro-inflammatory mediators (Nuclear factor kappa B [NF- κ B], Tumor necrosis factor-α [TNF-α], Interleukin-6 [IL-6], Interleukin-1β [IL-1β]), and apoptotic signaling (Bcl-2-associated x protein [Bax], caspase-3), while activating regulatory proteins c-jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) (identified as novel markers in CP-induced testicular injury). CP suppressed antioxidant defenses, steroidogenic factors (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein [StAR], 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [3β-HSD], 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [17β-HSD]), Heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression, and androgen receptor (AR) functionality, resulting in decreased testosterone, gonadotropin levels, and compromised spermatogenesis. LCM treatment effectively mitigated these deleterious effects through multi-target protective mechanisms including c-jun N-terminal kinase 1(JNK1)-mediated apoptosis inhibition, HO-1 upregulation, IL-6/ signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3) signaling suppression, prevention of p-JNK1/STAT-3 crosstalk, and AR preservation. This study establishes LCM's multi-target protective efficacy, supporting its potential as a safer antiepileptic alternative providing dual benefits of seizure control and reproductive preservation during chemotherapy.

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study evaluated the potential of the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) technique to assess radiogenic strontium (Sr) and lead (Pb) isotope signatures in bioavailable soil fractions as a proxy for plant uptake. Concentrations ( c DGT ) and isotope ratios of Sr ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) and Pb ( 207 Pb/ 206 Pb, 208 Pb/ 206 Pb, 206 Pb/ 204 Pb) assessed by DGT (TK100, Chelex), along with extractable (NH 4 NO 3 , NH 4 OAc, EDTA) and total Sr and Pb mass fractions and isotope ratios, were compared to those in Lactuca sativa L. (lettuce), Triticum aestivum L. (wheat), and Raphanus sativus L. (radish) grown on five geochemically distinct soils. Relative to conventional soil extraction, DGT significantly reduced matrix loads, facilitating isotope ratio measurements by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. DGT-labile Sr and Pb concentrations and isotope ratios reflected soil-specific geochemical signatures, allowing for clear differentiation among soils. Importantly, DGT-labile isotope ratios closely matched those in plant tissues across soils and species within analytical uncertainty, demonstrating that DGT captures the isotopically relevant bioavailable Sr and Pb pool without inducing significant mass-dependent isotopic fractionation. These findings establish DGT as a practical tool for bioavailable multi-isotope tracing with strong potential for applications in environmental forensics, food authentication, and archaeological provenance research.

    "Abstract": "In endangered species conservation, fecal samples are a vital non-invasive tool for gut microbiota analysis. Yet, the influence of external exposure time on microbial composition and function remains unclear, constraining data accuracy and reliability. To address this, we investigated the time-gradient effect in the globally endangered forest musk deer (Moschus berezovskii). Using non-invasive sampling under standardized captive conditions, fecal samples were collected at six storage times: (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 days). Gut microbiota composition, diversity, enterotypes, and functional differences were assessed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. In total, 147,013 valid ASVs (amplicon sequence variants) were obtained showing significant shifts in microbial composition with storage time. Dominant phyla included Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Increasing storage time led to declining α-diversity, reduced community stability, and more unique genera. PCoA (principal coordinates analysis) and NMDS (non-metric multidimensional scaling) indicated progressive separation of experimental groups from control groups, with Anosim and Adonis confirming progressive separation with storage time. Structurally, Firmicutes decreased while Proteobacteria, specifically the Acinetobacter genus, increased with storage time. Community assembly shifted from deterministic to stochastic processes, reflecting stronger environmental disturbance effects. These results demonstrate that the gut microbiota composition, diversity, and ecological functions in forest musk deer feces are highly sensitive to storage time. Thus, preservation duration must be strictly controlled as a critical variable in microbiome studies. This work establishes methodological standards for non-invasive fecal metagenomics in endangered species, providing theoretical insights and practical guidance for improving scientific rigor in conservation-related microbiome research. KEY POINTS: Fecal microbiota diversity and stability decline significantly with longer storage. Firmicutes decrease while Proteobacteria, especially Acinetobacter, increase over time. Storage duration strongly impacts microbiome data, requiring strict sampling control.",

    "Abstract": "Although marital status has been associated with survival in several cancers, evidence regarding its prognostic relevance in follicular lymphoma (FL), an indolent lymphoma characterized by prolonged survival, remains limited. In this population-based study using the SEER database, we identified 23,434 adult patients diagnosed with FL between 2013 and 2022. Propensity score matching was performed to balance baseline characteristics, and survival outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. In the overall cohort, unmarried patients were more likely to be female, older, and present with B symptoms (all P < 0.001), and demonstrated significantly lower 5-year overall survival (OS: 72.8% vs. 81.0%, P < 0.001) and cause-specific survival (CSS: 84.9% vs. 90.6%, P < 0.001) compared with married patients. After 1:1 propensity score matching on age, sex, race/ethnicity, Ann Arbor stage, B symptoms, treatment status, prior cancer history, and diagnosis year (matched cohort, n = 16,384), this survival disparity persisted (5-year OS: 72.5% vs. 81.3%; CSS: 84.7% vs. 90.7%; both P < 0.001). Multivariable Cox regression confirmed that unmarried status was independently associated with increased risks of OS (HR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.53-1.71, P < 0.001) and CSS (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.63-1.92, P < 0.001). These findings suggest that unmarried status is an independent adverse prognostic factor in patients with FL and highlight additional attention may be warranted for unmarried individuals during long-term disease management.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The development of sustainable, biocompatible scaffolds for bone tissue engineering is crucial to address the limitations of conventional grafting approaches. In this study, we report the fabrication and characterization of 3D-printed scaffolds composed of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), olive pith powder (OPP), and hydroxyapatite (HAp) using an extrusion-based technique. Four different formulations (1PVA/0OPP/HAp, 1PVA/1OPP/HAp, 2PVA/5OPP/HAp, and 5PVA/2OPP/HAp) were evaluated to investigate the effects of varying PVA-OPP ratios on the structural, mechanical, and biological properties of the scaffolds. FTIR analysis confirmed the successful incorporation of OPP and HAp into the PVA matrix through the retention of characteristic functional groups and enhanced hydrogen bonding. SEM analysis revealed that increasing OPP content improved inter-pore connectivity and surface roughness, with pore sizes ranging from ~ 382 to ~ 572 μm, which is ideal for osteogenesis. Mechanical testing demonstrated a balance between stiffness and ductility depending on OPP concentration. The 1PVA/0OPP/HAp scaffold exhibited the highest tensile strength and modulus, while the 1PVA/1OPP/HAp group showed superior strain capacity. Cytocompatibility assessed by MTT assay and fluorescent staining showed that moderate OPP content (1PVA/1OPP/HAp and 5PVA/2OPP/HAp) promoted cell viability and spreading, while excessive OPP (2PVA/5OPP/HAp) impaired proliferation, possibly due to phenolic compound-induced oxidative stress. These results suggest that OPP can serve as a promising, sustainable filler in bone tissue engineering scaffolds when used at optimized concentrations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRDs) compromise vascular integrity through systemic inflammation and (auto) immune reactions, which are associated with an increased risk of vascular complications. Venous stasis, endothelial dysfunction, and coagulation imbalance are the primary pathophysiological factors behind thrombotic events in these individuals. The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in IRDs is higher than in the general population, although the magnitude of this increase varies across diseases. Inflammatory damage to vessel walls, diminished elasticity, and compromised muscle pump function may contribute to the formation of varicose veins (VVs). A sedentary lifestyle, decreased muscular strength, and weight gain worsen the condition, particularly by adversely affecting venous return in the lower extremities. Consequently, the prevention of vascular issues in IRDs should be facilitated by both pharmaceutical interventions and rehabilitation with lifestyle modifications. A multidisciplinary rehabilitation strategy—encompassing regular physical activity, compression therapy, inflammation management, weight control, and patient education—enhances venous return, mitigates thrombosis risk, and improves quality of life.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Preoperative mechanical bowel preparation (MBP) and oral antibiotics (OA) are widely used to decrease the risk of postoperative septic complications after colorectal resections. Unfortunately, it is not clear whether bowel preparation can lead to symptoms of small bowel obstruction, which might even increase the risk of postoperative morbidity. Methods Consecutive Crohn’s disease patients undergoing bowel resections with formation of ileocolic or colocolic anastomosis were included in the present prospective observational study. Urgent surgery, surgery without preoperative MBP, colorectal cancer, and fecal diversion were exclusion criteria. A polyethylene glycol solution (2 L) was used for MBP. OA consisted of paramomycin and metronidazole taken at 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. at the evening before surgery. Occurrence of complications at the anastomotic site (leakage, peritonitis, abscess, or fistula in direct proximity to the anastomosis) was a primary outcome measure. Complications of MBP were recorded. Mechanical bowel preparation was defined as “incomplete” when patients took a lesser amount of MBP solution than scheduled. Results Between 2016 and 2024, ileocolic or colorectal resections with formation of an anastomosis were performed in 284 patients with Crohn’s disease. Nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain occurred during the MBP in 29% of patients ( n = 78), leading to termination of intake in 53 patients (19%) . Women ( p &lt; 0.001), patients hospitalized urgently because of acute abdominal pain ( p = 0.008), patients presenting with severe anemia before surgery ( p = 0.007), and patients scheduled for resections completed by ileocolic anastomosis as opposed to colocolic or colorectal anastomosis ( p = 0.01) demonstrated a significantly increased risk of incomplete MBP. Thirty-two percent of patients demonstrated apparent dilatation of small bowel at the time of surgery. The incidence of anastomotic complications was 4% in patients who were able to complete MBP and 7.5% after an incomplete MBP ( p = 0.27). There were no deaths. The conversion rate from laparoscopy to open surgery was increased in patients with small bowel dilatation (17% vs. 6%); however, the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.13). Conclusion There is a considerable incidence of obstructive symptoms after preoperative mechanical bowel preparation in Crohn’s disease patients. Nevertheless, an incomplete MBP is not associated with increased risk of intra- or postoperative complications and can be used safely in that particular population.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Cardiogenic shock complicates takotsubo syndrome (TTS) in approximately 10% of cases. The effectiveness of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) for managing cardiogenic shock in TTS remains unknown. Methods We assessed outcomes in TTS patients with cardiogenic shock who received MCS compared to medical therapy only by using data from the International Takotsubo Registry. Two independent propensity scores were computed to investigate outcomes of patients with an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) vs. medical therapy only (1:2 propensity score matched cohort) and patients with an Impella vs. medical therapy only (1:1 propensity score matched cohort). The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality and the secondary outcomes included MCS-related complications. Results Among 3740 eligible patients, 309 (8.3%) patients had cardiogenic shock, of whom 112 (36.2%) had MCS and 197 (63.8%) had medical therapy only. After propensity-score matching, the use of an IABP was found to be associated with a lower in-hospital mortality rate than medical therapy only (14.5% vs. 35.5%, P = 0.002), while mortality rates in the Impella group and medical therapy only group were comparable (25.0% vs. 29.2%, P = 0.75). MCS-related complications occurred in 6.0% of the IABP cohort and in 31.3% of Impella cohort. Conclusion Active MCS has been increasingly used for the management of cardiogenic shock in patients with TTS. This observational study could not demonstrate an association with improved mortality with an Impella device, but possibly with an IABP when compared to patients with medical management only. MCS-related complications occurred more frequently in the Impella cohort than in the IABP cohort. Further data are required to confirm results of the present study. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Heart failure (HF), including heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), remains a major public health issue with increasing disease burden. Recent advances, particularly data on sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), have shifted HFrEF treatment paradigms based on strong evidence from randomised-controlled trials (RCTs). There is a lack of data reflecting HFrEF patient outcomes in relation to SGLT2i treatment in a real-world environment. Methods The ongoing H 2 -registry, initiated in 2021, collects real-world data on hospitalised HF patients in Germany. We analysed HFrEF patients (left ventricular ejection fraction, LVEF ≤ 40%) enrolled until 30–11-2024, stratified by SGLT2i treatment status at index hospital discharge and during follow-up (FU). We assessed baseline characteristics, predictors of SGLT2i use, and 12-month outcomes. Results Of 810 HFrEF patients (513 SGLT2i, 297 no-SGLT2i), the median age was 70 years, and 23% were female. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. Median LVEF was 30%, and 39% had type 2 diabetes. Use of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system inhibitors, beta-blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) was more common in the SGLT2i group. Patients treated with SGLT2i at baseline had significantly lower all-cause mortality during FU in unadjusted time-to-event analyses (HR [95% CI] 0.53 [0.33–0.88]; p = 0.012). However, in multivariate analyses, only MRA treatment was independently associated with reduced mortality risk during FU (HR [95% CI] 0.41 [0.23–0.74]; p = 0.003). In a sub-cohort of patients being continuously treated with an SGLT2i during FU, the observed effect of SGLT2i was more pronounced (unadjusted HR [95% CI] 0.46 [0.28–0.77], p = 0.0023), and continuous SGLT2i treatment was significantly associated with lower all-cause mortality in multivariate analyses (adjusted HR [95% CI] 0.54 [0.30–0.99], p = 0.046). Conclusion In this prospective German HF registry, SGLT2i treatment was significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality in HFrEF patients only with continuous use during FU. Treatment with MRA was independently associated with lower all-cause mortality in all performed analyses. These findings add to the available body of evidence regarding the real-world effectiveness of SGLT2i in HFrEF. Trial registration NCT04844944. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Research background and purpose Unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) is well-established for mild varus deformity, but its application in moderate to severe varus cases remains technically challenging. This study aims to preliminarily evaluate whether adopting the traditional medial parapatellar approach in UKA procedures for these complex deformities can yield acceptable early outcomes. Methods A retrospective study was conducted. Between January 2023 and March 2024, 9 patients with moderate to severe varus deformity underwent medial UKA using a cemented fixed-bearing Link prosthesis by medial parapatellar approach. The cohort included 1 male and 8 females with a mean age of 65.3 years and mean weight of 60.6 kg. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon. Preoperative and final follow-up assessments included bilateral full-length standing radiographs for hip-knee-ankle angle (HKA), The Angle between the femoral mechanical axis and the tibial mechanical axis (hip-knee-ankle angle, HKA) was measured by software and recorded. The hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle was reported directly as the angle between the femoral and tibial mechanical axes. The normal alignment range was defined as 178°–182°, with values below 178° indicating varus deformity and those above 182° indicating valgus deformity. Knee range of motion (ROM), Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS) score, and Knee Society Score (KSS). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0, with P &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results The follow-up of 15.20 ± 1.95 months, all patients demonstrated primary wound healing without perioperative complications. Significant improvements were observed in all measured parameters: HSS score improved from 50.11 ± 3.41 to 92.11 ± 2.37 95% CI: (40.12, 43.88); KSS score from 59.89 ± 3.55 to 88.78 ± 2.49 95% CI: (27.65, 30.13); KSS function score from 44.44 ± 6.82 to 76.67 ± 7.07 95% CI: (28.33,36.12); ROM from 94.22 ± 1.92° to 122.67 ± 2.83° 95% CI: (26.60, 30.29); and HKA from 164.58 ± 4.16° to 176.64 ± 2.20°95% CI: (10.16, 13.98). All improvements were statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). No cases of aseptic loosening, unexplained pain, or polyethylene liner dislocation were observed during follow-up. Conclusion This preliminary experience suggests medial parapatellar approach for UKA in moderate to severe varus deformity may represent a technical option for carefully selected cases. However, these observations are limited by the small sample size and relatively short follow-up. Further validation through larger-scale studies with extended follow-up is warranted to establish long-term efficacy and safety.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction Periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) represent a major complication of total joint arthroplasty. While most infections are caused by staphylococci species, a notable proportion involves gram-negative bacteria. Due to the smaller numbers, outcome reports in literature are scarce and heterogenous success rates have been reported. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the overall treatment success of gram-negative PJI and (2) identify the most suitable surgical treatment strategy in eradicating gram-negative PJI. Materials and methods Seventy-two cases of gram-negative PJI treated between 2010 and 2022 were analyzed in this retrospective cohort study. The median follow-up (IQR) was 18.0 (46.0) and at least 12 months. Outcomes were assessed based on the 2013 Delphi consensus on PJI outcome. PJI was defined according to the EBJIS-criteria. Results The overall infection-free and revision-free survival rate was 43.1% (31/72) and 56.9% (41/72). 32 out of 41 treatment failures (78.0%) appeared within the first 3 months. Among the causative pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa-related PJI had the poorest outcome resulting in an infection-free survival of only 18.2% (2/11), whereas infections caused by Enterobacter cloacae had the highest success rate of 58.3% (7/12); ( p = 0.12). Success rates were 65.0% (13/20) for two-stage revision, 38.1% (8/21) for multi-stage revision, 36.0% (9/25) for DAIR and 16.7% (1/6) for single-stage revision. In total, 6 amputations, 2 knee arthrodesis, and 8 resection arthroplasties were required for definitive infection eradication. Conclusion Gram-negative PJI may follow a more aggressive course with earlier and higher failure rates than previously thought. DAIR may be an option in selected cases, while two-stage revision showed a trend towards a more favorable infection-free survival in comparison to single- and multi-stage revisions. The results suggest pathogen-specific differences may influence outcomes and support individualized treatment strategies, warranting confirmation in large, prospective, multicenter studies.",

This study examined whether omitting an initial AP pelvis film affected time to hip reduction and the need for additional CT imaging in patients with traumatic hip dislocations. Methods We conducted a retrospective review at a Level I trauma center (2005–2016). Eligible patients were adults (&gt; 17 years) with native hip dislocations evaluated under the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol. Patients with incomplete records or irreducible hips requiring operative reduction were excluded. Data collected included patient demographics, AP pelvis use, CT imaging, time to reduction, and presence of acetabular or proximal femur fractures. Results The study cohort consisted of 50 patients, 76% male ( n = 38), with a mean age of 33 years (range, 18–68). High-energy motor vehicle accident or motorcycle crash accounted for 90% ( n = 45) of injuries, and 94% ( n = 47) were posterior dislocations. Associated fractures were present in 76% ( n = 38). Patients were divided into those who had no AP pelvis radiograph prior to CT scan (N-APP group, n = 8; 16%) and those who obtained an initial AP pelvis radiograph on presentation (APP group, n = 42; 84%). All patients in the N-APP group received an additional CT pelvis scan, while none in the APP group did. Average time to reduction was significantly shorter in the APP group compared with the N-APP group (69 vs. 216 min, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Obtaining an initial AP pelvis radiograph provided a rapid and reliable means of diagnosing hip dislocations. Adherence to ATLS guidelines by performing a pelvic film before CT shortened time to reduction and prevented unnecessary repeat CT imaging in adult patients with traumatic native hip dislocations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Congenital heart disease (CHD) is frequently associated with extracardiac abnormalities that can significantly affect prognosis and management. Although abdominal ultrasound is a readily available and noninvasive tool, detailed observational studies on comprehensive screening for neonates with CHD remain lacking. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of significant abdominal abnormalities detected during early comprehensive ultrasound screening in neonates with CHD. This single-center, retrospective case series included neonates admitted to a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) between April 2021 and May 2024 who underwent screening within 14 days of birth. We compared the proportion of neonates with significant abnormalities and the number of abnormalities per patient between those with and without chromosomal abnormalities or malformation syndromes. Among 59 neonates, significant abnormalities were identified in 29 (49.2%). The most common were hydronephrosis (13.6%), hepatomegaly (10.2%), and intestinal malrotation (8.5%). The proportion of significant abnormalities did not differ significantly between the groups with and without chromosomal abnormalities or malformation syndromes (66.7% vs. 39.5%, P = 0.06). However, the number of abnormalities per patient was significantly higher in the former group (1.38 vs. 0.61, P = 0.03). Conclusion : Early comprehensive abdominal ultrasound screening in hospitalized neonates with CHD revealed significant abnormalities in 49.2% of cases. This screening may improve systemic management of patients with CHD, including perioperative care, and facilitate individualized treatment of CHD‒with or without chromosomal or malformation syndromes‒by enhancing phenotype characterization. What is Known: ・ Congenital heart disease (CHD) is frequently associated with extracardiac abnormalities that can affect prognosis and management. ・ Detailed observational studies on comprehensive abdominal ultrasound screening for neonates with CHD remain lacking. What is New: ・ Early comprehensive abdominal ultrasound screening in hospitalized neonates with CHD revealed significant abnormalities in 49.2%. ・ While abnormalities were more frequent in neonates with chromosomal or malformation syndromes, 39.5% of non-syndromic neonates had significant abnormalities; the screening improves systemic management and individualized treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Landmark manifolds consist of finite collections of distinct points in an underlying space, referred to as landmark configurations. The dynamics of these configurations can be used to represent flows, such as solutions to ODEs or shape deformations. In this work, we consider landmark configurations in Euclidean space and study how they can be connected via flows of vector fields. For dimensions greater than or equal to two, we explicitly construct two vector fields whose flows can connect any pair of landmark configurations with the same cardinality. This property is known as exact universal interpolation. In dimension one, we show that the same result holds for pairs of landmark configurations that share the same relative ordering. In all dimensions, controllability is achieved using one constant vector field and one polynomial vector field of degree three.",

    "Abstract": "Summary Sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a single parathyroid adenoma. Traditionally, bilateral neck exploration with assessment of all four glands was the gold standard, achieving cure rates up to 98%. This approach has largely been replaced by limited exploration (LE), in which a prelocalized hyperfunctioning gland is selectively removed using a small open, video-assisted, or endoscopic approach. Successful LE relies on accurate preoperative localization of single-gland disease. First-line imaging consists of high-resolution ultrasound combined with 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy with single-Photon Emission Computerized Tomograph (SPECT/CT). When results are negative or discordant, 18F-choline PET/CT is recommended, significantly improving localization and enabling targeted surgery. .Because multiglandular disease cannot be definitively excluded preoperatively, intraoperative parathyroid hormone (IOPTH) monitoring has become an important adjunct. IOPTH confirms complete excision of hyperfunctioning tissue and aids detection of additional abnormal glands. Several interpretive criteria exist, including Miami, Vienna, Halle, and Rome, with Miami and Vienna most commonly used. Although routine IOPTH use in concordantly localized single-gland disease remains debated, evidence suggests it reduces persistent disease and reoperation rates, particularly when imaging is inconclusive. Endoscopic, extracervical, and robotic approaches offer superior cosmetic outcomes but involve greater dissection, higher costs, and increased technical demands, limiting widespread use. Overall, advances in imaging and intraoperative adjuncts have enabled minimally invasive parathyroidectomy to replace bilateral exploration while maintaining excellent long-term outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Hip fracture (HF) is a common geriatric trauma resulting in a substantial rate of mortality and morbidity. Previous studies have shown that the application of leg compression significantly reduced the incidence of perioperative hypotension (PeH) and hypotension-related complication in obstetric surgery. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of medical compression stocking for prevention of PeH in elderly patients undergoing HF surgery. Methods Sixty patients were randomized in 2 groups: compression stocking (CS) group and no compression stocking (NCS) group ( n = 30 each). Compression stockings were worn on the uninjured leg after spinal anesthesia and then removed after 24 h postoperatively. Demographic and perioperative data were collected. Primary outcome was the incidence of PeH measuring as 3 methods: intraoperative hypotension (IoH), postoperative hypotension (PoH), and concomitant intraoperative and postoperative hypotension (CoIPH). The secondary outcomes were the incidence of using intraoperative vasopressor and in-hospital hypotension-related complications related to hip fracture. Results Baseline characteristics such as age, gender, diagnosis and operation were not significant difference between groups ( p &gt; 0.05 all). Regards the PeH, CS group demonstrated a significantly lower incidence in CoIPH than NCS group (0 patients vs. 6 patients, p = 0.02), and also showed a non-significantly lower incidence of the PoH and hypotension-related complication ( p = 0.13 and 0.10, respectively). However, the IoH, and the need of intraoperative vasopressor did not significantly differ between both groups ( p &gt; 0.05 all). Conclusion The application of medical compression stocking in elderly patients undergoing HF surgery demonstrated an ability to reduce the incidence of hypotension perioperatively and might prevent in-hospital hypotension-related complication.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the influence of voids on the acoustoelastic effect in solid materials, combining both theoretical and numerical approaches. An analytical model based on rules of mixture and the nonlinear elastic Murnaghan model is developed to describe the influence of the voids. Numerical simulations are conducted using ABAQUS/Explicit, where the voids are randomly distributed within the material, and both longitudinal and Rayleigh wave propagation are analysed. The results show that the second- and third-order elastic constants exhibit a nonlinear dependence on void density, with the third-order constants being more sensitive to changes in porosity than the second-order elastic constants. While the acoustoelastic constant remains nearly unchanged for low void densities, the propagation velocity of longitudinal and Rayleigh waves decreases with increasing void density, primarily due to the reduction in the second-order elastic constants. The analytical expressions show good agreement to the observed numerical simulations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract With the motivation to explore China’s nationally determined contributions (NDCs) toward a net zero emission future, we examine whether green technology innovation mitigates carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emission thereby improving environmental quality across five of the most populous provinces (consisting of 85 cities) for the period between 2007 and 2019 in a multidimensional panel approach with an endogeneity robustness from two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM). The results show green technology innovation, economic output (GDP), and financial development spur CO 2 emission in the across the provinces. Meanwhile, especially in the whole panel, green technology innovation is dependent on the level of industrial structure (a moderation effect), but this interaction effect fails to show desirable outcome in the province-specific cases. Additionally, in each of Guangdong, Henan, Hunan, Shandong, and Sichuan provinces, carbon emission is triggered by an increase in GDP and financial development. Additionally, green technology innovation (i) worsens carbon emission through the moderating effect of advanced industrial structure and industrial structure rationalization in Guangdong and Sichuan provinces (ii) worsens carbon emission through the moderating effect of rationalization of industrial structure in Henan, Sichuan, and Shandong provinces. These findings have vital policy insight toward improving the quality of green innovations in China. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study investigates treatment of municipal wastewater by using an integrated system involving aerobic granular sludge (AGS) process followed by two different membrane processes (microfiltration (MF) or ultrafiltration (UF)) and ultraviolet (UV) process for reuse in irrigation. Two different integrated systems (AGS-MF-UV and AGS-UF-UV systems) were compared in terms of treatment performance, filtration performance, and cost analysis. Similar removal efficiencies were achieved for the AGS–MF–UV and AGS–UF–UV systems in terms of chemical oxygen demand (&gt; 90%), total nitrogen (&gt; 75%), and total phosphorus (&gt; 74%). Since UF had superior pathogen removal performance compared to MF, UV process may not be necessary after the UF system. However, the operating cost of the AGS-UF system (0.223 €/m 3 ) was found more expensive than that of AGS-MF-UV system (0.203 €/m 3 ). The results of the cost analysis demonstrated that AGS-MF-UV system can be considered as a more economically feasible option in comparison with AGS-UF-UV system for treatment of municipal wastewater. The reclaimed water from AGS-MF-UV and AGS-UF-UV systems met the irrigation water requirements for Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and European Union (EU) standards. Graphical abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Ion exchange resins (IERs) are widely used in water treatment to remove hardness ions such as calcium (Ca 2+ ) and magnesium (Mg 2+ ), but their long-term performance is constrained by fouling, inefficient regeneration, and high chemical consumption. This study systematically optimised brine-based regeneration by evaluating four key operational parameters: pre-treatment mode (swollen vs dried), resin-to-brine ratio (1:1–1:4), brining temperature (25–60 °C), and NaCl concentration (1%, 5%, 10%). Dried resin exhibited approximately 14% shrinkage compared to the swollen state and achieved superior hardness removal due to reduced pore size and shortened diffusion pathways. SEM analysis confirmed structural damage and microbial fouling, underscoring the importance of pre-treatment. The optimal condition, dried resin regenerated with 5% NaCl at a 1:1 resin:brine ratio and 55 °C, yielded the highest Ca 2+ and Mg 2+ removal, as verified by atomic absorption spectrometry and oxidation–reduction potential analysis. This optimised strategy enhances regeneration efficiency, lowers chemical demand, minimises brine waste, and extends resin service life. The findings provide a cost-effective and sustainable approach for high-purity water production, with strong relevance to industries such as pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, and power generation.

    "Abstract": "Abstract The escalating global emphasis on sustainable construction and renewable materials has highlighted agricultural waste valorization as a critical research domain, particularly in response to the climate emergency. As the construction industry seeks alternative ecofriendly materials to mitigate environmental impact and expand affordable housing solutions, there is a pressing need to explore and evaluate suitable biomass resources in greater depth. Among these, corncob (CC) emerges as a significantly underutilized material with considerable potential for sustainable applications. Despite its abundance and promising properties, systematic understanding of the composition–structure–function relationships within CC anatomical fractions remains limited, impeding its optimal utilization in building and construction. This study employs a multi-analytical approach to investigate the intricate correlations between CC morphology, mechanical attributes, and chemical composition to establish its viability as a sustainable building material (SBM). The methodology integrated microscopic analysis (SEM–EDS), mechanical characterization, and chemical assays. Microscopy reveals differentiated ultrastructure that collectively confer balanced strength–ductility attributes. Elemental mapping demonstrated predominant carbon (64.73–67.74%) and oxygen (31.22–34.05%) composition, with strategic distributions of silicon (2.52%) and aluminum (0.69%) contributing to mechanical properties. Mechanical testing showed compressive strength (67.6 MPa) attributable to the lignocellulosic reinforcement grid resisting fractures. Comparatively, tensile testing indicates elasticity (Young’s modulus 191.19 MPa), exceeding most agricultural residues resulting from interfibrillar sliding mechanisms accommodating strains. Chemical analysis revealed optimal lignocellulosic composition complemented by functional additives (1% pectin, 4.21% resistant starch). Integrated morphological and mechanical characterization coupled with compositional mapping and the preliminary life cycle assessment substantiate cob waste as an economical bio-based substitute for mainstream building insulation, 3D printing, carbon sequestering, structural, and non-structural applications. The multi-level examination provides understanding of structure–function influences to direct processing interventions for customized material properties. Graphical abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Medicinal and recreational Cannabis sativa is a sector that has increasing acceptance both in academia and industry due to an easing in legislation. This presents a challenge due to the legislative constraints of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and an opportunity for sustainable management and valorisation of this waste. In this study, a mixture of organic medicinal cannabis sativa waste was processed using hydrothermal deconstruction at temperatures of 200, 250, and 300 °C for varying times of 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min, respectively. All samples were undertaken with an initial oxygen pressure of 34 bar. Volatile fatty acids are produced throughout the reaction, with the highest total amount of 2,294 mg/L being produced at 5% initial feedstock, 300 °C, after 60 min. The amounts of acetic acid, propanoic acid, ammonia, total COD, TSS, and VSS are all highly influenced by the effects of both time and temperature, where the concentrations of phosphorus and CO2 gas produced are primarily controlled by temperature. The product of the hydrothermal deconstruction reaction exhibits fertiliser properties, improving initial germination and plant growth by 90.0% over ten days. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens have increased life expectancy and improved quality of life in people with HIV (PWH). However, the necessity for lifelong ART use presents adherence and persistence challenges. Recent population-level data regarding such challenges with contemporary daily oral ART regimens are limited, particularly in the United States. This observational, retrospective, noncomparative cohort study used data from HealthVerity MarketPlace closed medical and pharmacy claims from PWH ≥ 18 years of age (treatment naive or treatment experienced) who were insured in the United States. Eligible PWH had ≥ 2 pharmacy refills for a Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) guideline-recommended complete daily oral ART regimen between January 1, 2016, and November 30, 2023, with ≥ 365 days of continuous baseline enrollment and ≥ 180 days of follow-up. The index date was the date of the first recorded pharmacy claim for a complete ART regimen, regardless of prior treatment experience. Rolling adherence was measured using the Continuous, Multiple Interval Measure of Medication Acquisition method that compared the timing of prescription fills versus the number of days the prescription was intended to last, within blocks of 90 days. Suboptimal adherence was defined as proportion of days covered &lt; 85%. Treatment interruption was defined as a gap in ART medication supply of &gt; 90 days, followed by resumption of ART at any point, with combined treatment interruption/discontinuation defined as a &gt; 90-day gap in ART medication supply, regardless of whether ART was restarted. Switching between DHHS guideline-recommended ART regimens and from DHHS guideline-recommended to nonguideline-recommended ART regimens was also evaluated. A total of 73,533 PWH were included in the study (60,062 [81.7%] treatment naive and 13,471 [18.3%] treatment experienced). The proportion of PWH on treatment for ≥ 1 year who remained adherent during all 90-day blocks decreased from 40.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 39.6%–40.8%) by the end of Year 1, to 24.2% (95% CI, 23.7%–24.6%) at the end of Year 2, and to 17.7% (95% CI, 17.3%–18.1%) at the end of Year 3 when standardized by age group-sex-region. The standardized annual prevalence of suboptimal adherence remained relatively constant between 2017 and 2022 (46.7%–53.2%). The standardized proportion of PWH who persisted on daily oral ART without treatment interruption was 81.2% (95% CI, 80.8%–81.6%) after 1 year, 74.1% (95% CI, 73.7%–74.6%) after 2 years, and 70.6% (95% CI, 70.1%–71.1%) after 3 years. Switching between DHHS guideline-recommended daily oral ART regimens remained below 10% between 1 and 3 years of follow-up and was similar for switches from guideline-recommended to nonguideline-recommended daily oral ART regimens. The findings of this study suggest that suboptimal adherence to daily oral ART remains a challenge, even with the availability of modern regimens.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a major global health challenge, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly recognized as a transformative tool for early detection, disease progression modeling, and therapeutic discovery. This systematic review, conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, analyzed 156 peer-reviewed studies published between 2010 and 2024, identified from four major databases (Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore). A particular emphasis was placed on multimodal approaches that integrate neuroimaging, genetics, biomarkers, and clinical data to improve accuracy and translational value. To organize this fragmented field, we introduce a novel Layered Framework that categorizes AI applications into four domains: Early Detection, Disease Progression Modeling, Therapeutic Discovery, and Real-World Integration. In addition, we applied ARIMA-based forecasting to project research trajectories through 2030, which revealed generative models and transformer architectures as the fastest-growing and most promising methodologies. The review highlights substantial advances in early detection and multimodal fusion, particularly through deep learning, while also identifying persistent challenges such as limited model generalizability, ethical concerns, and underexplored clinical implementation. Addressing these barriers will require multi-cohort validation, interpretable AI, and equity-driven model development. By consolidating evidence and forecasting future directions, this review provides a roadmap for accelerating precision-driven innovations in Alzheimer’s care.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study investigated monogenean infestations in Tilapia zillii collected from the Nile River in Kafr El-Sheikh Governorate, Egypt, using an integrated approach that combined morphological, molecular, immunological, and oxidative stress analyses to elucidate host-parasite interactions. Morphological examination identified Cichlidogyrus tilapiae as the predominant monogenean on gills, characterized by diagnostic haptoral armature and a sclerotized copulatory organ. Molecular confirmation via cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( cox1 ) sequencing matched reference isolates with high similarity and moderate to strong support. All three cytokines showed significant upregulation in infested Tilapia zillii compared to controls: interferon gamma (IFN- γ) increased 3.30-fold, interleukin-1 (IL-1) 2.63-fold, and interleukin-10 (IL-10) 2.53-fold, with all changes being statistically highly significant. Oxidative stress biomarkers were concurrently elevated, indicating redox imbalance: catalase (CAT) increased 2.02-fold, superoxide dismutase (SOD) 2.03-fold, and reduced glutathione (GSH) 2.44-fold. Histopathology revealed distinct structural alterations in infected gills, including epithelial erosion, hyperplasia, lamellar fusion, edema, and inflammatory infiltration. Collectively, these findings provide quantitative evidence that C. tilapiae induces strong pro- and anti-inflammatory responses alongside oxidative stress in T. zillii . These results underscore the substantial histopathological impacts and support the value of integrated diagnostics in informing parasite management in Egyptian aquaculture.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The increasing complexity of software development has prompted a shift in project management practices toward agile methodologies, often supported by specialized software tools for planning and reporting. However, many widely adopted tools offer only limited decision support capabilities. This work introduces ProjectION, an intelligent software tool designed to enhance decision-making in agile project management through techniques relative to the Search-Based Software Engineering field. Based on an in-depth analysis of the challenges faced in agile environments, ProjectION assists decision makers in monitoring project status, forecasting progress, and automating software release planning. A comprehensive usability study was conducted with a small sample of experienced IT professionals, following the ISO/IEC 25062:2006 Common Industry Format. Key usability metrics of effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction were assessed. Despite minor usability issues, results indicate that ProjectION effectively supports agile release planning. A second experiment further demonstrates the tool’s utility in generating optimal release plans, outperforming manual solutions proposed by decision makers. To foster collaboration and future development, the core algorithms and execution service have been made publicly available, enabling integration of novel approaches to the Next Release Problem.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Understanding how soil organic matter (SOM) fractions, such as mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) and particulate organic matter (POM), respond to nutrient management practices is essential for improving soil health and advancing sustainability in agroecosystems. In particular, there is a need for strategies that sustain and enhance soil fertility while simultaneously reducing nitrogen (N) losses and greenhouse gas emissions. Co-applying compost and fertilizer has the potential to improve soil health by building SOM and increasing fertilizer N retention in the soil, which can be especially beneficial for low nutrient-demanding crops like olives. In a two-year field study conducted in a super-high-density olive orchard, we investigated the effects of compost application and N fertilization rate on SOM fractions down to 90-cm depth and on nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. Using 15 N-labeled fertilizer, we traced fertilizer N in the soil over time. Compost application increased the concentration of carbon (C) and N in topsoil, including in MAOM and POM, with the largest effects occurring in the first year. We also observed greater concentrations of C and N within MAOM at deeper soil layers with compost, but compost did not increase the concentration of fertilizer N remaining in the soil over two years. Compost significantly reduced N₂O emissions, especially background emissions. These effects may have been mediated by increased soil C from compost application, particularly dissolved organic C, which may have driven SOM turnover, MAOM formation, and N 2 O reduction. Together, these results suggest that compost application can be an effective strategy for sustainable nutrient management and building soil health, particularly in low-input perennial tree crop systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Many companies create private governance—collectively designed arrangements such as ecological or social standards that guide corporate conduct. Yet explanations for why firms engage in such governance creation remain fragmented across a wide range of studies and disciplines. This article synthesizes existing research into a comprehensive framework that integrates macro-level institutional conditions with meso- and micro-level drivers and barriers, thereby clarifying the antecedents of corporate engagement in the creation of private governance. We also develop a research agenda addressing these gaps within debates on political corporate social responsibility (PCSR). While PCSR articulates normative ideals of legitimate corporate engagement, empirical findings show governance creation often serves instrumental reasons. Our framework clarifies why and under what conditions firms engage in the creation of private governance.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In recent years, machine learning techniques for time series prediction have gained significant traction due to their effectiveness and versatility. However, these algorithms often require a minimum amount of data to ac hieve optimal performance and avoid overfitting. In many real-world applications, such data is scarce or difficult to obtain, creating challenges for training accurate models. This limitation highlights the importance of developing methods that can work effectively with small datasets. To address this issue, we propose AIDAN, a novel approach that integrates artificial intelligence, data augmentation, and normalization techniques to enhance predictions for small, low-frequency time series. AIDAN employs transformations to diversify data samples while preserving their essential characteristics and explores the impact of normalization to stabilize data for training machine learning algorithms. We evaluated the performance of our approach by varying the prediction horizon across multiple domains, including environmental and socioeconomic data, for the ten largest global economies using heterogeneous datasets. Our findings revealed that AIDAN outperformed both a set of traditional time series prediction methods (ARIMA, ARIMA-GARCH, and Exponential Smoothing) and a simple machine learning ensemble (Jitter + diff + MLP), achieving between 6% and 9% higher accuracy for short-term predictions and approximately 15% for long-term predictions. This research provides an effective framework for advanced machine learning-driven time series prediction in low-frequency and data-scarce scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Summary Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for novel and effective therapeutic agents. Conventional treatments, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery, are often associated with significant adverse effects, prompting the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to evaluate the anticancer effects of Scorpio fuscus venom ( SFV ) on human colorectal cancer models using integrated in vitro and in vivo approaches. SFV constituents were characterized using gel electrophoresis, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography and UV–visible spectrometry. Identified peptides were subjected to structural modeling and in silico docking analyses against selected proteins associated with colorectal cancer and apoptosis-related pathways. The cytotoxic effects of SFV were assessed in human CRC cell lines (DLD-1, HT-29, and CaCo-2) and a healthy colon epithelial cell line (CCD-18Co) using Alamar Blue assays after 48-h treatment, and half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) values were determined. SFV treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in cancer cell viability, accompanied by decreased migratory capacity and colony formation ability. Apoptotic responses were further evaluated by flow cytometry and gene expression analyses, indicating modulation of apoptosis-associated genes. For in vivo validation, subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft colon cancer models were established in mice. SFV administration led to reduced tumor growth compared with control groups. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed altered expression patterns of selected tumor-related markers in SFV -treated tumors. Gene expression profiling demonstrated ≥ twofold changes in 51 genes, including downregulation of BAK1 and TRAF3, and upregulation of BIRC2, BIRC3, BIRC6, CASP8, TNFRSF8, TNFRSF11, and BOK. Collectively, these findings indicate that SFV exerts significant antitumor effects in colorectal cancer models and support its potential as a promising anticancer agent, warranting further mechanistic and translational investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Assimilation efficiency is a critical assumption of stable isotope mixing models and bioenergetics models, yet few studies examine how assimilation efficiency influences modeling inferences. We conducted laboratory experiments to determine rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss ) assimilation efficiencies. Assimilation efficiency averaged 55.8% (SE ± 0.90) and 64.5% (SE ± 1.98) at the 10% and 25% ration levels, respectively, and did not differ significantly. Caloric energy egested in feces was not significantly different between ration levels. Caloric energy excreted in ammonia and urea was significantly different between the ration levels, with a higher amount at the 25% ration level. Absorption efficiency was significantly greater at a higher ration level. Percent energy egested in feces was significantly greater at lower ration levels. Percent energy excreted as ammonia and urea was high compared to previous studies and did not differ significantly by ration level. Our estimates of assimilation efficiency of rainbow trout (56% and 65%) were lower than some previously reported estimates, and our estimates of energy losses (feces and ammonia) were higher than some previous estimates. As knowledge of species-specific assimilation efficiencies increases, our ability to draw strong inferences and improve the accuracy of model predictions will improve.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Tropical dry forests (TDFs) provide essential ecosystem services yet are notoriously difficult to map using remote sensing data due to their spectral similarity to open fields, variability in forest regrowth, and factors such as seasonal leaf phenology and landscape fragmentation that hinder their discrimination. These limitations are critical in data-scarce regions where traditional classification methods struggle. This study introduces a novel semi-supervised deep learning (DL) framework for land use and land cover (LULC) change detection, combining synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical satellite imagery for TDF change detection. The proposed framework combines unsupervised pseudo‑labeling and a custom Y‑Net architecture to fuse optical and radar imagery, enabling accurate change detection with limited labeled data. The framework achieves state-of-the-art results, with a mean overall accuracy of 95.3% and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 88.1%, outperforming established models like standard U-Net and PSPNet. Even in scenarios where only 60% of the dataset is labeled, the semi-supervised method maintains accuracy above 90%, demonstrating its robustness in limited-data conditions. The proposed semi-supervised framework is applied to reveal TDF changes in the Cauca River Valley in Antioquia (Colombia) using satellite images between 2017 and 2021. These findings provide a valuable foundation for advancing remote sensing applications in environmental monitoring, conservation planning, and sustainable resource management.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose This systematic review explores the relationship between tobacco smoking and the development of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Prior literature investigating the link between tobacco smoking and glaucoma has reported contradictory findings on the association between tobacco smoking and POAG. Methods Systematically EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Web of Science were searched, encompassing articles published up until April 2025. The inclusion criteria comprised observational and randomised controlled studies that provided a statistical analysis exploring the association between tobacco smoking and POAG in adult populations. The ROBINS-E tool was utilised to assess the risk of bias of studies and meta-analyses were completed using RevMan software. The main outcomes were effect estimates that measured the association between tobacco smoking and POAG. Results Across 26 eligible studies and 289,930 participants, there was a prevalence of 6,454 cases of POAG. The meta-analyses revealed that current smokers (OR = 1.00, 95%CI 0.76–1.33, p = 0.97, n = 11), past smokers (OR = 0.92, 95%CI 0.75–1.11, p = 0.38, n = 6) as well as both current and past tobacco smoking combined (OR = 1.00, 95%CI 0.84–1.19, p = 1.00, n = 17) exhibited no statistically significant association with POAG when compared to individuals who had never smoked. Heterogeneity ranged from low to substantial across comparisons, and risk of bias was frequently rated as high among included observational studies. The lack of an associative effect was sustained, on exclusion of studies with a high risk of bias. Conclusion Although the results suggest no significant statistical association between tobacco smoking and POAG, given the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with tobacco smoking and the detrimental impact on systemic and ocular health, tobacco smoking cessation should remain at the forefront of health promotion.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Microalgae cultivation in aquaculture effluents offers an opportunity for high-value biomass production coupled with bioremediation but can be suppressed by bacterial competition. We hypothesized that co-cultivation of Haematococcus pluvialis, known for the synthesis of the valuable carotenoid astaxanthin, with mixotrophic non-green algae could reduce bacterial pressure, leading to enhanced production of algal biomass and nutrient removal. The growth of algae in fourteen two-species co-cultures was screened on 24-well plates, and the best-performing combinations were tested in 650-mL culture bottles in a long-term experiment (28 days) for stability, biomass production, nutrient removal, and biomolecular composition. Contrary to our hypothesis, mixotrophs stimulated bacterial proliferation rather than suppressed it. Co-cultivation reached equal biomass production in comparison to the monoculture of H. pluvialis and frequently improved the nutritional quality of biomass in terms of higher contribution of proteins, total and essential fatty acids (EFAs). However, the highest content of proteins, fatty acids, and EFAs was detected in monocultures of mixotrophs. Particularly Gymnodinium impatiens was rich in EFAs and was successfully cultivated both in mono- and co-cultures for 28 days. Removal of phosphorus and nitrogen by co-cultures was equal to or lower than that by the monoculture of H. pluvialis . Overall, although non-green mixotrophic algae did not decrease bacterial abundance or increase biomass production or nutrient removal, they improved the quality of the produced algal biomass, producing lipid- and protein-rich biomass in aquaculture effluent.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Shock is a life-threatening condition marked by inadequate tissue perfusion and oxygen supply, leading to organ failure if not rapidly addressed. Clinical management of shock involves detecting and correcting altered macro hemodynamic parameters. However, these parameters may not accurately reflect microcirculatory alterations or abnormalities in oxygenation. A resuscitation strategy focused on peripheral perfusion, which can be non-invasively monitored, may allow for earlier shock detection and treatment, potentially reducing mortality. This literature review aims to study the available technologies found in literature and in patents to non-invasively monitor peripheral perfusion. PRISMA method was employed to systematically select or exclude articles and patents, resulting in 44 studies and 21 patents included in the review. The found technologies were classified based on the sensing principle in light (reflected, transmitted, or scattered), Doppler effect, temperature, and skin mottling. Combining the monitorization of microcirculatory with macrocirculatory parameters has the potential to have an accurate prognosis value for shock and other diseases. However, the various technologies that have been developed to monitor peripheral perfusion require further research and testing in diverse conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this work is to introduce a concept of traveling waves in the setting of periodic metric graphs. It is known that the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation on periodic metric graphs can be reduced asymptotically on long but finite time intervals to the homogeneous NLS equation, which admits traveling solitary wave solutions. In order to address persistence of such traveling waves beyond finite time intervals, we formulate the existence problem for traveling waves via spatial dynamics. There exist no spatially decaying (solitary) waves because of an infinite-dimensional center manifold in the spatial dynamics formulation. Existence of traveling modulating pulse solutions which are solitary waves with small oscillatory tails at very long distances from the pulse core is proven by using a local center-stable manifold. We show that the variational formulation fails to capture existence of such modulating pulse solutions even in the singular limit of zero wave speeds where true (standing) solitary waves exist. Propagation of a traveling solitary wave and formation of a small oscillatory tail outside the pulse core is shown in numerical simulations of the NLS equation on the periodic graph.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Limited research on social functioning hinders understanding of the developmental effects of prenatal intimate partner violence (IPV) exposure. We examined the association between prenatal IPV exposure and children’s socioemotional competence during the preschool years, exploring maternal sense of mastery, depressive symptoms, and postnatal IPV exposure as potential pathways. Methods Participants included 2,309 mother-child dyads from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Socioemotional competence was assessed using the caregiver-reported Adaptive Social Behavior Inventory at child age 5, while prenatal IPV exposure was mother-reported at childbirth. Maternal sense of mastery, depressive symptoms, and postnatal IPV exposure were assessed when the child was 3 years old. Structural path modeling was used to estimate direct and indirect paths from prenatal IPV exposure to children’s socioemotional competence via maternal sense of mastery, maternal depressive symptoms, and postnatal IPV exposure, adjusting for child sex, maternal race/ethnicity, age and education and household income. Results Prenatal IPV exposure was negatively associated with maternal sense of mastery at 3-year postpartum ( β =-0.084, p &lt; .001). In turn, lower levels of maternal mastery were associated with lower levels of children’s socioemotional competence at 5 years ( β = 0.116, p &lt; .001), yielding a significant indirect association ( β =-0.010, 95%CI=-0.123-0.034). Although prenatal IPV exposure was associated with maternal depressive symptoms ( β = 0.118, p &lt; .001) and postnatal IPV exposure ( β = 0.352, p &lt; .001), the pathways to socioemotional competence were not significant. Conclusions Findings highlight the importance of trauma-informed, empowerment-focused perinatal interventions that strengthen maternal adaptive coping and parenting strategies to support socioemotional development in the context of prenatal IPV exposure.",

For this purpose, tempering experiments were performed on multiple samples of 22MnB5 steel with an aluminum–silicon coating, using different cooling conditions to promote the formation of distinct microstructural states. MBN measurements were conducted to analyze the influence of these conditions on the magnetic response of the material. The results indicated that the MBN signal profiles exhibit distinct patterns for each cooling condition, particularly the position and amplitude of the envelope peaks, indicating changes in phase composition and hardness. Furthermore, the presence of the aluminum–silicon coating influenced the magnetic response due to the formation of an interfacial layer during the heat treatment. These findings demonstrate that the MBN technique is an effective nondestructive tool for monitoring thermally induced microstructural changes in advanced high-strength steels.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In eddy current testing, a time-varying magnetic field generated by a current-carrying coil is coupled with an electrically conductive specimen. The interaction of the induced electromagnetic field with the part, specifically with its material properties and geometrical discontinuities, causes a change in the impedance of the same (transmit or driver) coil or a separate (receive or sense) coil. When a transmit-receive type probe is used, either with two concentric or side-by-side coils, both coils are placed on the same side of the part. The receiving coil couples with the material under test, but even more with the driving coil; therefore, this arrangement reduces discontinuity sensing capabilities of the technique. To interrogate over the full thickness of the part, it is proposed herein to emulate the through-transmission ultrasonic testing for eddy current inspections, with the driver and the receiver coils on opposite sides of the investigated part. A stationary, planar, large-diameter printed-circuit copper coil is mounted on the far side of the part or embedded in a multi-layer structure, while a pencil-type probe is employed to scan in a plane parallel to the part’s top surface. Either of the coils could be used for driving or sensing. and the coupling between the two coils is realized through the entire thickness of the evaluated part. With the planar coil as a driver and the pencil coil as a receiver, the depth of investigation is enhanced by the area of the excitation coil, while the resolution is improved by the scanning step and small diameter of the sensing probe. The work is a demonstration of the viability of through-transmission eddy current testing with structure embedded printed circuit board coils for in-situ condition monitoring of metallic structures.",

Objectives This study presents a map of Swedish primary forests, explores their persistence in a managed landscape, and assesses their suitability as baselines for studying land-use impacts. Methods We mapped 384 primary forests across Sweden and assessed their naturalness using historical records. To evaluate factors influencing their persistence, we analyzed their accessibility by measuring proximity to historical roads and timber floating rivers, and their boulder coverage. Lastly, we assessed the suitability of primary forests as baselines by comparing their topographic characteristics with those of managed secondary forests. Results Most primary forest land (93.6%) remains at higher elevations, associated with low productivity and accessibility, while 6.4% occurs in lowland areas. About one-third of the lowland productive primary forest land is topographically similar to the typical Swedish forest landscape. These forests are located farther from 1939 roads and more frequently in boulder-rich terrain than non-primary forest land. Conclusions Different types of primary forests persist: low-productivity mountain forests and lowland forests with historically limited accessibility. A considerable share of the latter have topographic conditions similar to those of managed secondary forests, indicating that their persistence was likely not driven by unfavorable condition for forest management but by accessibility constrains. These lowland primary forests may be useful baselines for further studying ecosystem impacts of land-use change.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This article discusses experimental attempts and imaginaries of interdisciplinary healthcare in alternative group practices, focusing on health activist movements in contemporary Germany and their predecessors in the 1970s-to-1980s, West German ‘Health Movement’. As new forms of working in primary care, these practices stand for reimagining medical practice as a sociopolitical institution, and its possibilities for remaking patient and doctor subjectivities. Both times, this activism is part of broader developments of social-cultural and political change, and pervaded with a stubborn, critical optimism in its potential to foster societal transformations that extend beyond the group practice as a physical place. I explore these experimental projects through Davina Cooper’s (2013) concept of “everyday utopia”, arguing for closer attention to the affects, desires and attachments healthcare professionals, and in particular doctors project onto them. Drawing on utopian studies and health activism literature, I take up Cooper’s distinction between “imagination” and “actualization” to argue how, regardless of its success, experimenting with alternative ways of practising and working together makes current conditions in medicine bearable for those involved.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims Efficient phosphorus (P) and management is essential for sustainable arable systems. Cover crops (CCs) are promising, but their performance is uncertain in high-latitudes. This three-year study evaluated CCs’ effects on P dynamics in a P-rich soil undersown in barley in Mid-Norway (63.9°N)—one of the northernmost trials of its kind. Methods A randomized complete block design included three CC treatments: ryegrass (CC1), a ryegrass–clover mix (CC2), and a four species mix including grass, legumes and herbs (CC3), and controls without CC (with/without NPK fertilizer). Soil and plant analyses included total and available P, total N, potentially mineralizable N (PMN), pH, permanganate-oxidizable carbon, root biomass, plant P concentrations, and microbial abundance via qPCR. Statistical analysis was based on Linear Mixed Models (LMMs). Results Cover crops successfully established (average biomass: 1525 kg ha⁻ 1 ), accumulated ~ 7 kg P ha⁻ 1 , and did not reduce barley yields. LMMs showed significant effects of CC treatment on root biomass, total P, and bacteria. Pairwise comparisons also revealed that fungal abundances in CC1 and CC3 were significantly higher than in the unfertilized control. Pairwise regression revealed that soil total P was strongly predicted by root biomass (β = 1.37, P &lt; 0.001). Available P was negatively controlled by microbial pools (Bacteria: β = -9.22, P &lt; 0.001) and residue quality (C:P ratio: β = -0.36, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions CCs can be used at 63°N without yield penalty. The primary P mechanism is mass-driven sequestration (root biomass) into the stable total P pool. However, P availability is temporally constrained by residue quality and microbial competition. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Aims Plant–soil feedbacks (PSFs) are key drivers of forest composition and diversity, yet their direction and magnitude may depend on the mycorrhizal identity of interacting species, environmental conditions, and experimental context. Methods We conducted complementary greenhouse and field experiments using Acer rubrum L., Acer saccharum Marsh., Prunus serotina Ehrh. (all arbuscular mycorrhizal [AM] species), and Quercus alba L., and Quercus rubra L. (all ectomycorrhizal [EM] species) to test how biomass-based PSFs vary with mycorrhizal matching between seedlings and adult trees, light availability, and soil microbial communities. Seedlings were grown in soil conditioned by conspecifics, conmycorrhizal heterospecifics, or heteromycorrhizal heterospecifics under controlled and natural light regimes. Results Consistent with expectations, AM species consistently exhibited negative PSFs under low light, and EM species tended to show more positive PSFs, but this pattern was contingent on light and greenhouse versus field setting. For AM species, negative PSFs occurred primarily under low light and were neutralized or reversed under higher light. EM species showed generally more positive PSFs across light levels and settings, although species-specific differences emerged. PSFs were driven largely by conspecific soil conditioning, with limited influence from the mycorrhizal identity of heterospecific neighbors. Results from greenhouse versus field settings diverged, with field PSFs sometimes attenuated or reversed, particularly for Q. alba. Conclusions These findings highlight that biomass-based PSFs are not fixed species traits but context-dependent outcomes influenced by mycorrhizal type, light availability, and environmental setting. Incorporating these factors is essential for predicting how PSFs influence seedling recruitment, forest dynamics, and biodiversity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Countries have agreed on the necessity of teaching children about, through, and for their rights. Specifically, the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training (2011) requires that such education be integrated into school curricula. The question of how this integration should occur has sparked debate among scholars and practitioners. In Switzerland, which encompasses three different linguistic cultures, contexts, and curricula, children’s human rights education (CHRE) is linked to several subjects and is conceptualized as a cross-curricular and interdisciplinary topic. This article aims to elucidate the conceptual foundation of children’s rights education (CRE) provisions within Swiss schools, as a heterogeneous study leading to conclusions relevant for other contexts. The role of curricula and interdisciplinarity for CHRE is analyzed. Also, the drivers and barriers to CHRE identified by teachers and other educational actors are outlined. Based on this analysis, suggestions for supporting CHRE teaching are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have opened new opportunities for early literacy instruction, yet the role of AI on foundational decoding skills remains underexplored. Grounded in the simple view of reading and self-teaching theory, which emphasize the importance of establishing accurate grapheme–phoneme correspondences for autonomous reading, this study examined whether an AI-based conversational chatbot could support decoding practice in kindergarten. Seventy-one pupils (5–6 years old) completed two instructional conditions (AI vs. traditional) in a counterbalanced within-subject design. Letter identification, recognition, phonological awareness, working memory, and pupils’ perceptions were assessed. Children showed significant gains across conditions. Low-performing pupils showed descriptively larger gains after AI ( p &lt; .001 identification; p &lt; .001 recognition) versus traditional instruction ( p = .014; p = .007), though direct contrasts mostly non-significant except marginally for identification ( p = .042). Phonological awareness improved for low performers in both conditions ( p &lt; .001), with AI advantage ( p &lt; .001 interaction). High-performing pupils benefited similarly from both modalities. Processing-speed measures improved across conditions without AI superiority ( p = .898; p = .251). Pupils’ attitudes were generally positive, though preferences divided between AI-based and teacher-led activities. These findings suggest AI-based conversational agents may support differentiated early decoding instruction, particularly for struggling pupils, while reinforcing rather than replacing teachers’ essential pedagogical role.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The emergence of scientific discoveries is often seen as the most extraordinary and puzzling feature of science. Many think that discoveries arise due to serendipity or chance—that they are unexplainable or unpredictable. Existing studies have not yet explained the extent and role of serendipity in science, because they generally only study a sample of discoveries that does not allow for generalising about science. To do so, this is the first study to assess science’s major discoveries, defined as all nobel-prize and major non-nobel-prize discoveries across fields and history. By examining over 750 major discoveries, we find that discoveries commonly labelled as serendipitous are actually sparked by using—for the first time—a powerful new tool that makes the unexpected observation possible that we are not even looking for: an improved microscope revealed cells, a discharge tube uncovered X-rays, gel diffusion revealed the Hepatitis B virus and a cutting-edge spectrograph detected the first planet outside our solar system. What seems like chance is often just using an entirely new lens—just as in each of these discoveries. In other words, we show that breakthroughs that seem serendipitous follow shortly after we create the new tool, with other researchers able to arrive at the same findings using these same discovery tools. While a serendipitous moment was reported in about one in six major discoveries, there is a pattern behind the surprise: using new tools to make the breakthrough finding commonly through exploratory research. This is important because it changes how we think about discovery: we can generally better understand individual serendipitous discoveries as tool-triggered discoveries that multiple researchers can make. Crucially, new method innovations provide explanatory power to help predict discoveries—whether labelled serendipitous or not. So here we reframe discovery: because new tools are what commonly unlock surprise, we can actually strategically design and accelerate discovery, shifting it from a more passive outcome of serendipity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This article explores the concept of legal personality in William Shakespeare’s play The Merchant of Venice. Borrowing from John T. Noonan, Jr.’s concept of the masks of the law, this article suggests that the law plays a role in shaping the legal person. It further suggests that the law had this effect on Antonio and Shylock when it empowered Shylock, a Jewish merchant of lower social status in Christian Venice, to enforce a contract that permitted him to recover a pound of Antonio’s flesh. The law enforced a legal persona that exceeded Shylock’s social status. After examining these literary themes, this article examines the debate between Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association (2011), a United States Supreme Court case that determined that a California law prohibiting the sale of violent video games to children was a violation of the freedom of speech. In the case, minor children and video game manufacturers were both affixed with the legal mask of a full legal person, without consideration of the vulnerable reality of the minor children. This egalitarian model of interpersonal relationships ironically marginalizes a person by affixing a mask of supposedly expanded legal persona while simultaneously concealing the specific needs of the individual beneath the mask.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Adsorption is an effective method for removing various types of pollutants from aqueous effluents, and the production of adsorbent materials from biomass represents a sustainable alternative. In this study, biochars produced from the pyrolysis of acerola processing residues at temperatures ranging from 300 to 700 °C were evaluated as adsorbents for methylene blue dye. Batch adsorption tests revealed rapid adsorption kinetics, with equilibrium being reached within 30 min. The adsorption data were best described by the Langmuir isotherm and the pseudo-first-order kinetic model, indicating monolayer adsorption controlled by the availability of active sites. The biochar produced at 400 °C exhibited the highest adsorption performance, achieving a maximum adsorption capacity of 67.29 mg g −1 and a dye removal efficiency of approximately 94% at an initial concentration of 100 mg L −1 . This superior performance was attributed to the optimal balance between surface area development and the preservation of oxygenated functional groups, which promote methylene blue adsorption through electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. Overall, the results demonstrate the strong potential of acerola residue-derived biochars as low-cost and sustainable adsorbents for wastewater treatment, while also providing an environmentally sound destination for agro-industrial waste.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Fipronil is a widely used agricultural insecticide associated with the contamination of apiculture products and honeybee mortality. This study evaluated the presence of fipronil in honey samples from conventional and agroecological apiaries in Paraná, Brazil, and its toxic effects on Africanized Apis mellifera bees. Honey from four conventional apiaries showed fipronil levels above the maximum residue limit (0.05 µg mL −1 ), while agroecological samples showed no detectable contamination. Toxicological tests revealed that ingestion was the most toxic exposure route (LC 50 = 0.74 µg mL −1 ), followed by topical (LC 50 = 3.07 µg mL −1 ) and indirect contact (LC 50 = 7.34 µg mL −1 ). Fipronil exposure significantly reduced bee survival, with nearly 100% mortality after 120 h. However, no significant effects were observed on locomotion, flight, or acetylcholinesterase activity. The findings highlight the risks of fipronil to bee health and the quality of honey. The contamination of honey samples by the insecticide fipronil highlights the need for stricter regulations and sustainable agricultural practices. Agroecology emerges as a viable alternative to protect pollinators and ensure the sustainability of beekeeping.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Fungicides applied to grapevines can increase the levels of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn) in soils and cause phytotoxicity to plants. However, plants native to the Pampa biome might have the potential to phytostabilize these metals. The study aimed to (a) verify whether higher levels of Cu, Zn, and Mn in the soil increase the concentrations of these elements in different organs of the native species; (b) determine which variable is most directly associated with biomass variation in the evaluated species; and (c) identify the tolerance mechanisms used by these species to tolerate high levels of Cu, Zn, and Mn in the soil, as well as their phytostabilization potential. To this end, three native species, Axonopus compressus , Paspalum notatum , and Paspalum plicatulum , were grown in vineyard soil and native field soil. The cell wall and vacuole played an important role in detoxifying the metals. The concentrations of photosynthetic pigments were lower in the A. compressus and P. notatum species grown in the vineyard soil.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Most accounts of English stress assume that it is determined by a combination of morphological and phonological factors. Two main factors have been proposed to determine the patterns of observed stress in English verbs with no productive morphology: whether the verb is prefixed, and the weight of the final syllable. This paper tests whether stress assignment to English verbs can be accounted for without recourse to abstract morphological properties and whether, instead, alleged morphological effects emerge as a function of the statistical patterning of stress among recurrent forms in the lexicon. The paper implements a discriminative learning network (NDL), a well-established computational learning model that is trained using error-driven learning (Rescorla &amp; Wagner, 1972; Baayen et al., 2011, see Arndt-Lappe et al., 2023 for application to stress). The model, which uses 1,948 verb types from Jones’ pronunciation dictionary (Roach et al., 2006), works with phonotactic information only and does not have access to higher-level information about the morphological structure of words. The NDL model reaches the same level of accuracy as competing regression models that use the traditional predictors (syllable number, weight, morphological status of initial string). Closer inspection reveals that the NDL model brings about the alleged morphological and weight effects by a gradient association of phonotactics and stress. In the network, which has no explicit information about morphological structure, morphological effects emerge as a function of the recurrence of certain phonological strings. At a higher level, the results speak in favour of theories in which stress (and effects of weight and morphology) emerge from dynamically changing associations between representations in the lexicon.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Seiridium is a genus of Sordariomycetes ( Amphisphaeriales , Sporocadaceae ), primarily known for species that cause cypress canker on Cupressaceae trees. However, most species in this genus have been reported from angiosperms, including many species in the native range of their hosts. Several unidentified Seiridium strains, collected &gt; 20 years ago from Acacia mearnsii trees in eastern South Africa and southeastern Australia, were recently recovered from a collection of preserved cultures. We considered the phylogenetic position of these Seiridium strains and assessed their pathogenicity on A. mearnsii . Maximum likelihood analysis of three concatenated gene regions revealed four well-supported clades. Two closely related clades corresponded to Australian and South African origins, whereas two other clades representing South African isolates formed a monophyletic group with S. kartense , a species known from Eucalyptus cladocalyx on Kangaroo Island in Australia. Genome-wide average pairwise nucleotide identity and genetic differentiation analysis supported three species, including isolates considered conspecific with S. kartense and two that we consider to represent new species. These are described and named here as Seiridium mearnsii sp. nov. and Seiridium rouxiae sp. nov. Inoculations with South African isolates failed to produce evidence of pathogenicity. Seiridium species from A. mearnsii have likely been introduced into South Africa from Australia, along with the planting material used to establish A. mearnsii forestry.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper presents the design and simulation of a pressure-swing distillation (PSD) process for separating and purifying di-n-propyl ether (DnPE) from n-propyl alcohol (nPA) using Aspen HYSYS software. The minimum-boiling-point azeotrope formed at atmospheric pressure makes conventional separation methods ineffective. Three critical parameters, feed stage, feed temperature, and reflux ratio, are systematically optimized to minimize energy consumption. The optimized process achieves product purities of 99.5% DnPE and 98.7% nPA while reducing energy consumption by 15% compared to conventional distillation. Additionally, an XGBoost regression model is developed to predict reboiler heat duty with 95% accuracy, further enhancing process efficiency. Particle swarm optimization is employed to identify optimal operating conditions based on the machine learning predictions. This integrated computational approach demonstrates significant improvements in separation efficiency, highlighting the industrial potential of the optimized PSD process for azeotropic mixtures.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Migraine is a chronic, disabling brain disorder. Melatonin, a circadian regulator with anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive actions, has been proposed for migraine prevention. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of melatonin for prophylaxis. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science (September 29, 2024) for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing melatonin with placebo or other active drugs. Outcomes were analysed as change from baseline to last follow-up using mean differences (MD) or risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results Nine RCTs ( n = 788) were included. Versus placebo, melatonin reduced attack duration (MD -4.98 h; 95% CI -9.30 to -0.67; p = 0.02), headache days (MD -1.54 days; 95% CI -2.50 to -0.58; p &lt; 0.01), headache severity (MD -2.08; 95% CI -2.91 to -1.26; p &lt; 0.01), and analgesic use (MD -1.38; 95% CI -2.41 to -0.36; p &lt; 0.01). Melatonin also increased the response rate (≥ 50% reduction in monthly headache frequency) (RR 1.38; 95% CI 1.11–1.70; p &lt; 0.01) and improved sleep quality (PSQI: MD -1.64; 95% CI -2.85 to -0.42; p = 0.008) and disability (MIDAS: SMD − 4.07; 95% CI -5.45 to -2.69; p &lt; 0.001). Compared with amitriptyline, melatonin was generally less effective for attack duration and severity, with no consistent advantage on analgesic use or response; however, melatonin showed a more favourable tolerability profile, including lower risk of sleepiness (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.28–0.87; p = 0.01). Conclusions Melatonin demonstrates benefits over placebo for reducing migraine burden and improving patient-reported outcomes, with a favourable safety profile. While amitriptyline remains more potent for several efficacy endpoints, melatonin represents a reasonable preventive option, particularly as an adjunct during titration of first-line agents. Further head-to-head trials with standardised dosing and longer follow-up are warranted.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Bread is among the most discarded foods globally. The objective of this study was to investigate incorporating bread crumbles into baked goods as a strategy for bread waste reduction. Three bread types (white (W), whole-grain (WG), and whole-grain with seeds (S)) were converted into crumbles. These were used in bread and muffins by replacing 10–30% (bread) or 10–50% (muffins) of wheat flour. W-type crumbles had high starch, WG crumbles had high arabinoxylan, and S-type crumbles had high protein and lipid content. Dough properties were evaluated via the Farinograph and Extensograph. Crumble addition increased water absorption and development time of bread dough but decreased dough stability, extensibility, and maximum resistance to extension in a dose-dependent manner. Above 10%, crumbles reduced specific volumes (30–44% for bread, 8–9% and 14–17% at 30% and 50% in muffins, respectively), increased firmness, and made bread loaves and muffins darker. In contrast, bread with 10% and muffins with 10% and 30% crumbles possessed similar properties, including sensory attributes, to controls. Bread with S-type crumbles had a different flavor profile than other breads, particularly at higher substitution levels. Ten percent of any crumble type could be incorporated without significantly impairing quality, highlighting industrial feasibility. Above 10%, the crumble type, i.e., the ingredients for the bread used to make the crumbles, became a critical factor. This study was the first to compare crumbles from different bread types. Results showed that incorporating bread crumbles into bread and muffin recipes is a suitable strategy to recycle surplus bread and contribute to waste reduction.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The practical applications of essential oils are limited by their hydrophobicity, volatility, and instability; however, cryogels have emerged as promising carriers that can overcome these challenges by enabling the controlled release of bioactive compounds. This study aimed to synthesize and characterize cryogels based on pinhão starch and loaded with oregano essential oil (OEO). Cryogels were produced with pinhão starch (9%, w/v) and incorporated with OEO at concentrations of 15 and 25% (v/w, in relation to starch). The process involved gelatinization, freeze/thaw cycles, and freeze-drying. The OEO was evaluated for its chemical composition, thermogravimetric analysis, functional groups, and in vitro antifungal activity. The cryogels’ morphological, structural, thermal, and chemical properties were evaluated, along with their antifungal activity. The major constituents of OEO were carvacrol (69.22%), o-cymene (14.31%), caryophyllene (5.09%), and γ-terpinene (5.06%). All cryogels exhibited the typical morphology of these materials, with a well-defined internal macroporous structure. The incorporation of OEO increased cryogel density from 0.086 g/cm 3 (control) to &gt; 0.092 g/cm 3 , while slightly reducing porosity from 88.3% to &lt; 87.4%. The control cryogels exhibited a water absorption capacity of approximately 1300%, while OEO-loaded cryogels showed reduced values (~ 1190-1206%), with no significant difference between the two OEO concentrations. The thermal stability of OEO was enhanced by its incorporation into the cryogel structure. While free OEO began to degrade at a lower temperature of 186.1 °C, the OEO within the cryogels showed greater thermal resistance, with degradation observed only at temperatures up to ~ 320 °C. Cryogels containing 15% and 25% OEO exhibited high antifungal activity against Penicillium crustosum and Aspergillus flavus . Pinhão starch-based cryogels demonstrated strong potential as sustainable carriers for OEO for future application in active food packaging, due to their favorable physicochemical properties, enhanced thermal stability, and antifungal activity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Orthognathic surgery is an elective procedure. Yet unexpected challenges, such as difficult intubation, can arise perioperatively. This report presents two cases of failed nasal intubation requiring alternative approaches to avoid canceling surgery. The first case involved a 57-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea and dentoskeletal deformity undergoing bimaxillary advancement. Despite multiple attempts, nasal intubation failed, prompting submental diversion, which allowed successful surgery. The second case involved a 15-year-old female with a history of cleft-related surgeries and suspected Goldenhar syndrome. After failed intubation with a size 6.0 tube, submental diversion was again employed, enabling a seven-hour procedure without complications. These cases highlight the importance of preoperative airway assessment, particularly in patients with obstructive sleep apnea or prior maxillofacial surgery. While nasopharyngoscopy is not routine, it may be beneficial in high-risk cases. Submental intubation offers a viable alternative, ensuring surgical access while avoiding cancellation. Informed consent should address potential intubation difficulties to mitigate legal risks.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The paper introduces a new non-factive theory of knowledge, employing the recent theory of verisimilitude developed by Jakob Süskind to model the relative adequacy of representations as their approximation to truth. It makes the relation of representation one of the necessary conditions of knowledge without requiring the truth condition to be satisfied. However, the relation of knowledge to truth is built at the meta-level into the notion of the adequacy of representations, which enables the proposed theory to cover any thinkable case of research yielding real knowledge, although of a non-factive kind. Despite its universality, the theory relativizes knowledge to a set of research questions, while rejecting alethic relativism, which — it is argued — does not provide a satisfactory explanation of truth in reasoning about the growth and extinction of scientific knowledge.",

Mutations in Forkhead box G1 ( FOXG1 ) cause FOXG1 syndrome, a condition sharing core ASD features. Here, loss of Foxg1 in the indirect pathway spiny projection neurons (iSPNs) in mice recapitulates ASD symptoms, including social, language, and fine movement deficits. Foxg1 deficiency causes dendritic simplification, spine reduction, and impairs excitatory synaptic transmission. Transcriptome reveals that FOXG1 drives gene networks to multidimensionally control synaptic functions from spine morphogenesis, synaptic maturation, ion transmembrane transport, glutamate receptor clustering, to neurotransmitter release and synaptic transmission. Importantly, FOXG1 directly activates the transcription of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) subunits, and pharmacological potentiation of AMPAR activity normalizes synaptic function and rescues behavioral deficits. Our study provides a new perspective on the relationship between FOXG1 and ASD etiology in iSPNs and suggests the potential of AMPAR activation as a therapeutic intervention for ASD and FOXG1 Syndrome.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Ovules, the precursors of the seeds, develop through three coordinated processes: female gametophyte development, pre-fertilization nucellar degeneration, and integument growth. While much progress has been made in understanding gametophyte and integument development, pre-fertilization nucellar degeneration has remained largely overlooked until recently. Recent studies in Arabidopsis have now shown that pre-fertilization nucellar degeneration is a highly ordered program of vacuolar cell death regulated by PIN1/3/4/7-mediated auxin efflux and further requires female gametophyte-derived signals. These findings establish that pre-fertilization nucellar degeneration is not a passive by-product of ovule growth but an active, tightly controlled process. This review summarizes current knowledge on ovule classification and development, with a focus on pre-fertilization nucellar degeneration, and proposes its potential biological advantages and evolutionary implications: providing space and resources for female gametophyte expansion, facilitating pollen tube attraction and entry, and potentially driving the evolutionary shift from ancestral crassinucellate to derived tenuinucellate ovules in angiosperms. Main conclusion Pre-fertilization nucellar degeneration in ovule development is not a passive by-product of ovule growth but an active, tightly regulated process of vacuolar cell death, orchestrated by efflux-mediated auxin signaling and female gametophyte-derived cues, which together support gametophyte development and facilitate fertilization in angiosperm lineages with tenuinucellate ovules.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives Lipoedema is a chronic disorder primarily affecting women. Often mistaken for obesity due to its characteristic build-up of fat cells in the legs and sometimes arms, lipoedema leaves women vulnerable to social stigma. This study investigated the role of fears of compassion and depressive symptoms in the context of weight stigma and internal weight bias in women with lipoedema. Preregistration This study is not preregistered. Method Cross-sectional data from an international online survey with 843 women with lipoedema were analysed using structural equation modelling to assess the relationships between experienced weight stigma, internal weight bias, fears of compassion and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9). Results Greater experienced weight stigma and internal weight bias were linked to increased fears of compassion. Experienced weight stigma most strongly correlated with fears of compassion from others ( p &gt; 0.001), while internalised weight bias most strongly correlated with fears of self-compassion ( p &gt; 0.001). In turn, greater fears of compassion from the self ( p &gt; 0.001) and others ( p &gt; 0.001) but not fears of compassion for others ( p = 0.566) were related to greater depressive symptom severity. Further, both experienced weight stigma and internalised weight bias were associated indirectly with depressive symptoms via fears of compassion ( p = 0.001). Conclusions In lipoedema, fears of compassion from others and the self may be exacerbated in the presence of experienced weight stigma and internalised weight bias, leading to increased severity of depressive symptoms. Targeting fears of compassion and addressing negative self-perceptions surrounding body weight through psychological interventions may therefore support psychological wellbeing and outcomes for women with lipoedema.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction Hürthle cell carcinoma (HCC) -recently known as oncocytic carcinoma- is a rare type of differentiated thyroid cancer that presents a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge because of its morphological heterogeneity and uncertain biological behavior. Methods This retrospective single-center cohort study included all the patients with HCC who underwent surgical treatment in our center from January 2009 to May 2024. The epidemiological, clinical, and oncological data of the included patients were analyzed. Results This study included nineteen cases of HCC (9 males and 10 females). The average age at diagnosis was 54.8 ± 12.2 years. Preoperative fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) classified 2 tumors as Bethesda I, 7 as Bethesda III, 6 as Bethesda IV, and 4 as Bethesda V. A variety of surgical procedures were used, including hemithyroidectomy in 3 patients and total thyroidectomy in 12 patients. Two patients underwent neck dissection. The median tumor size was 6.7 cm. Pathological evaluation identified 9 patients with unifocal lesions and 10 with multifocal lesions. Only one patient showed positive lymph node involvement. The median times to death, distant metastasis, and locoregional recurrence were 4, 13, and 6 years, respectively. For locoregional recurrence, the restricted mean survival time (RMST) at five years was 4.4 years (95% CI 3.9–4.9), 4.6 years (95% CI 4.1–5.0) for distant metastasis, and 4.1 years (95% CI 3.6–4.5) for overall survival. There was a trend towards worse prognosis in females, younger age, and those with primary surgery outside the center. These differences did not achieve statistical significance, at least partly due to the small sample size. Conclusion Diagnosing HCC remains challenging due to its overlapping features with other thyroid conditions, making fine-needle aspiration cytology less definitive. Surgical treatment remains the preferred therapeutic option. Age, gender, and the volume of the surgical center for the initial procedure can influence patient outcomes, particularly recurrence and survival rates.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Calsequestrin 2 (CASQ2) has emerged as a central sensor and modulator of calcium (Ca 2+ ) dynamics in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), influencing both health and disease. This review explores the molecular architecture and multifunctional roles of CASQ2, beginning with its domain organization and Ca 2+ -binding properties and detecting how its folding and supramolecular assembly modulate Ca 2+ storage and release within cardiac muscle. Post-translational modifications, genetic regulatory mechanisms and CASQ2’s multipartner interactome; including Ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2), triadin and junctin are also discussed to highlight potential models in which complex stoichiometry and luminal Ca 2+ dictate channel refractoriness and excitation-contraction coupling. Disruption of CASQ2 function is increasingly recognized as a driver of certain types of arrhythmias, notably catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and heightened risk of sudden cardiac death. This review appraises contemporary therapies that focus on pharmacological and device-based interventions and surveys next-generation strategies that aim to directly stabilize CASQ2 or target its gene expression. Despite therapeutic advances, the challenges remain; and a translational agenda aligning mechanism with therapy is proposed. By integrating recent structural, functional, regulatory and pathological insights, this review provides a conceptual framework for the pivotal role of CASQ2 in arrhythmogenesis and positions CASQ2 biology at the center of precision cardiology.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Analysis of power is often omitted from research on stigma. This project examined structural stigma and power in health care for people affected by blood-borne viruses and sexually transmissible infections (BBV/STIs) with a focus on societal norms and hidden assumptions that shape health care practice and policy. Method In-depth interviews were conducted in 2023 with 24 key informants with expertise in designing and delivering services for people with BBV/STIs. Analysis examined stigma embedded in techniques of governing people affected by BBV/STIs. Results Participants noted the ways in which societal norms produce health systems, infrastructure, practices, and attitudes that work to keep people affected by BBV/STIs excluded from or receiving sub-optimal care. Stigma associated with BBV/STIs was tainted by moralism and perceived disgust in societal norms surrounding these conditions and associated practices. Participants noted that these norms supported “taken for granted” policies or procedures that worked to exclude people or protect the health system from complaint or change. Suggestions of means to address the impacts of these norms on health systems and dismantle stigma power included strengthened complaint systems and involvement of people with lived/living experience in decision-making and service delivery roles. Conclusion There are reciprocal and mutually productive relationships between societal norms and health care systems. Disrupting these relationships needs specific intervention given the foundational influence of societal norms and porosity between social worlds and health systems. Looking upward to governance systems already in place might be one tool to bring to light and reshape stigma power relations in health systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The growing need to reduce CO 2 emissions has encouraged the use of alkali-activated materials as sustainable alternatives to Portland cement. However, these binders are often susceptible to significant autogenous and drying shrinkage, which can compromise dimensional stability and durability. This study evaluates the influence of expanded vermiculite (EV) on the autogenous and drying shrinkage behavior of alkali-activated slag mortars. Mixtures containing 5%, 10%, and 15% EV were produced under dry, 100%, and 200% pre-saturation conditions, with a constant binder-to-aggregate ratio of 1:2 and a (w/b) ratio of 0.48. Physical and mechanical performance was analyzed through consistency, air content, density, compressive strength, capillary absorption, and microtomography tests. The results indicated that increasing the vermiculite content reduced the bulk density by up to 9.1% and increased the incorporated air content, which in turn decreased compressive strength by up to 31.4%. Capillary water absorption rose markedly in mixtures with 15% EV at 200% pre-saturation after 90 min. Autogenous shrinkage decreased by 66.4% in mixtures with dry EV, and 200% pre-saturation produced an additional 36.1% reduction. These results demonstrate that the moisture state of EV strongly governs shrinkage and pore connectivity in alkali-activated mortars. Controlled internal curing enhances dimensional stability while limiting strength losses when EV saturation and w/b are properly balanced. A forthcoming life-cycle assessment will quantify the environmental trade-offs of incorporating EV as an internal-curing agent.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Cronbach’s coefficient alpha is one of the most commonly used measures for assessing the internal consistency or reliability of a set of items, ensuring that they measure the same research objectives. It is used as a measure of reliability in fields like education, psychology, sociology, medicine, accounting and economics. Cronbach’s alpha will be estimated for a general covariance matrix using a Bayesian approach and comparing these results to the asymptotic frequentist interval valid under a general covariance matrix framework. Most of the results used in the literature require the compound symmetry assumption for analyses of Cronbach’s alpha. Fiducial and posterior distributions will be derived for Cronbach’s alpha in the case of the bivariate normal distribution. Various objective priors will be considered for the variance components and the correlation coefficient. The posterior distribution of one of the priors considered corresponds to the fiducial distribution. The performance of these priors will be compared to an asymptotic frequentist interval often used in the literature. A simulation study will be considered to compare the performance of the priors and the asymptotic interval, where the coverage rates and average interval lengths will be computed. The simulation study showed that even though the asymptotic interval improved in the case of larger sample sizes, the Bayesian approach still consistently outperformed the asymptotic frequentist interval.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Thrombosis triggers various severe diseases, while antithrombotic drugs carry bleeding risks, making the development of novel natural anticoagulants a subject of widespread attention. Poecilobdella manillensis , a prevalent medicinal leech, exhibits remarkable anticoagulant and antithrombotic activities. However, the material basis underlying its anticoagulant effects remains insufficiently investigated. This study aims to mine anticoagulant peptides from P. manillensis by peptidomics analysis, elucidate the material basis of its anticoagulant activity, and provide candidate molecules for developing novel natural anticoagulant drugs. Proteins extracted from P. manillensis were enzymatically digested and fractionated using DEAE-52 and CN columns. The resulting peptide components were analyzed by UPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS, and peptide sequences were matched against proteomic databases using Proteome Discoverer. Anticoagulant peptides were predicted using the BIOPEP-UWM database and PeptideRanker server, followed by in vitro and in vivo activity validation. Results showed that the hydrolysate consisted predominantly of low-molecular-weight peptides. 1533 peptides with Mw &lt; 3000 Da (length &lt; 20 amino acids) were identified from the PM-A2 and PM-A3 fractions, accounting for 40.76% of the total. Four peptides selected through predictive screening demonstrated anticoagulant and antithrombotic activities in vitro. Among them, LE-11 significantly prolonged both APTT and TT ( P &lt; 0.0001). Furthermore, LE-11 effectively alleviated carrageenan-induced thrombosis in mice, outperforming the heparin control at the mid-concentration (20 mg/kg). In this study, the highly active anticoagulant peptide LE-11 was identified from P. manillensis through peptidomic analysis. These findings establish a solid foundation for developing anticoagulant drugs from this source and provide critical scientific support for its clinical application in treating thrombotic diseases.

Using a mass spectrometry-based metabolomics approach coupled with molecular networking, we identified seven pyridomycin derivatives, six of which were novel. Three of these novel compounds were linear, featuring a unique 3-hydroxypicolinic acid– l -threonine–3-(3-pyridyl)- l -alanine (3HP–T–3PA) scaffold. Their structures were elucidated via detailed NMR studies. While two cyclic derivatives ( 4 and 5 ) showed modest antitubercular activity, the three linear derivatives, despite possessing the key 3HP–T–3PA moiety, exhibited no inhibitory activity. This intensive MS-based approach demonstrates the important role of such techniques in the discovery of novel biologically active core structures and their natural derivatives. Graphical Abstract",

UV–Vis–NIR spectroscopy revealed high transmittance (&gt; 90%) and suppressed reflectance (~ 12%), while Tauc plots indicated a tunable bandgap (~ 2.0 eV) through GO-induced electronic coupling. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated humidity-responsive proton conductivity up to 6.0 × 10 − 3 S/cm at 90 °C under 100% relative humidity, achieved without sulfonation or external doping. Mechanical testing showed enhanced tensile strength and stiffness at 1.0 wt% GO, identified as the optimal loading, with incipient aggregation effects at higher concentrations. These synergistic trends establish a clear structure–property–performance relationship, positioning OPVA–GO nanocomposites as sustainable platforms for transparent photonic films, flexible optoelectronic devices, and renewable energy interfaces.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose of Review Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common disorder of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) in pediatrics. In IBS, the bidirectional relationship between the central nervous system and the enteric nervous system is altered. Gut dysmotility, changes in the gut microbiome, diet, and psychosocial factors play an integral role in the pathophysiology of IBS. A biopsychosocial approach is, therefore, paramount to the management of IBS. This article provides a comprehensive review of the strategies available to clinicians. Recent Findings Effective patient-physician-family communication is the cornerstone of any successful therapeutic regimen for IBS. Timely and clear communication of the diagnosis and treatment options is essential. Regarding therapies, there is a degree of trial and error involved as therapy plans are tailored to each individual patient. Current treatment options include dietary modifications, pharmacologic agents, nerve field stimulating devices and, importantly, psychological therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy and gut-directed hypnotherapy. Summary There is no singular treatment algorithm for pediatric patients with IBS. A combination of dietary interventions, pharmacologic agents and emerging modalities such as nerve stimulating devices, combined with strong psychosocial support, offers a growing toolkit for the clinician.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Dynamic time warping (DTW), a typical elastic similarity measure that compares one-to-many points, has been proven effective for various time-series data mining tasks. However, it requires a quadratic time complexity $$O(n^2)$$ proportional to the length of time-series data, which undermines its applications involving long time series. In this paper, a representation-based similarity measure called Dynamic Sub-Sequence Warping (DSSW) is proposed. Instead of working on the raw data directly, we perform data representation to extract the distributional features of time series. Then, the similarity between two time series is measured by aligning the corresponding sub-sequences composed of the extracted features. We evaluate the proposed method through a supervised learning task on extensive real-world datasets. The results show that DSSW outperforms the prevalent DTW-based methods in terms of precision, and achieves one order of magnitude faster execution time on average compared with DTW.",

This study systematically reviews recent advances in synthetic data generation for biomedical applications and clinical research, focusing on how LLMs address data scarcity, utility, and quality issues with different modalities. We conducted a scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines and searched literature published between 2020 and 2025 through PubMed, ACM, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. A total of 59 studies were included based on relevance to synthetic data generation in biomedical contexts. Among the reviewed studies, the predominant data modalities were unstructured texts (78.0%), tabular data (13.6%), and multimodal sources (8.4%). Common generation methods included LLM prompting (74.6%), fine-tuning (20.3%), and specialized models (5.1%). Evaluations were heterogeneous: intrinsic metrics (27.1%), human-in-the-loop assessments (44.1%), and LLM-based evaluations (13.6%). However, limitations and key barriers persist in data modalities, domain utility, resource and model accessibility, and standardized evaluation protocols. Future efforts may focus on developing standardized, transparent evaluation frameworks and expanding accessibility to support effective applications in biomedical research.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Biochar is suggested to enhance the phytoremediation of cadmium (Cd) via regulating the rhizosphere environment and plant traits in contaminated soil. However, the effect of phosphorus (P)-modified biochar, the rhizosphere effect, and their interaction in improving phytoremediation efficiency of Salix for Cd remains unclear. Here, the effects of bamboo biochar, phytic acid-modified biochar, and sodium phytate-modified biochar on soil properties, the microbial community, plant traits, and Cd accumulation of Salix J1010 in Cd contaminated soil were comparatively and systematically studied. P-modified biochar significantly increased plant growth, Cd accumulation, and its translocation from roots to the aboveground parts of Salix . Cd concentration, root biomass, net photosynthetic rate, and rhizosphere microbial community variations were identified as critical predictors for phytoremediation efficiency using random forest models. Rhizosphere bacteria were more influenced by biochar amendment, while the fungi were more influenced by the rhizosphere effects. A key bacterial cluster, with a preference for high soil carbon and P, was further found to stimulate root growth and improve the bioavailability of soil Cd. Collectively, the study revealed differentiated responses of bacteria and fungi to biochar and rhizosphere effects of Salix , highlighting the importance of biochar modifications to optimize microbial interactions and enhance the phytoremediation efficiency of Salix in Cd-contaminated soils.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Deep generative models are widely used to generate high-dimensional data such as images. Because these models often do not provide explicit likelihoods, their performance is typically evaluated by comparing samples from real and generated data. The most common metric is the Fréchet Inception distance (FID), which compares the first two moments of embedded features extracted by a pre-trained Inception network. Although FID is popular for its simplicity, many studies have pointed out its limitations when used as the sole evaluation metric. In this work, we propose using the sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) with CLIP embeddings as a more reliable alternative. We design a controlled synthetic experimental framework to compare image-generation models and show that SWD outperforms FID in detecting small differences between image distributions. We also evaluate the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and highlight its practical limitations. Our findings provide practical guidance on selecting appropriate evaluation metrics for image-generation tasks.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper analyses the warnings that were expressed before the introduction of the Euro and investigates whether the alerters’ conviction that the Euro crisis proved them right is justified. It seems to be the case that the real problems were quite different from the ones discussed before 1999. The paper investigates the question on several levels: It analyses the development of the textbook by De Grauwe from the 1st to the current (14th) edition and shows that the problems that were discussed before and during the first years of the monetary union were quite different from the ones that were important in the crisis. It looks at some contributions from international economists: Paul Krugman, Barry Eichengreen, and the debate between Charles Wyplosz and Martin Feldstein. A special emphasis lies on the contributions of the German Council of Economic Experts (“Sachverständigenrat”): The Council’s analyses are a prime example of concentrating on matters that turned out to be of minor importance in the Euro crisis whereas other topics were not touched upon at all. Furthermore, it will be shown that before the outbreak of the Euro crisis, some characteristics that turned out to be detrimental for the monetary union were not regarded as a bug, but as a feature. One example is the current account imbalances; another example is the fact of the Euro being like a foreign currency from the perspective of the member states.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Young’s modulus is one of the geomechanical properties used in the design phase of different rock engineering applications. Difficulties in sample preparation and the high cost of experimental equipment lead researchers to perform studies on the estimation of Young’s modulus. However, previous studies on this topic are often limited in terms of rock type and/or number of data. Therefore, a comprehensive database covering a wide variety of rock types is needed for reliable estimation of Young’s modulus. To address this deficiency, a large database including Schmidt rebound value, uniaxial compressive strength, and porosity was compiled from the literature to derive equations and models for Young’s modulus estimation. Multivariate regression analysis and adaptive-neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) were used to predict Young’s modulus of rock materials. The reliability of the derived multivariate regression equations was verified using F - and t -tests, and the equations were found to be statistically reliable. The prediction pperformance of multivariate regression analysis and neuro-fuzzy models was compared using root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The ANFIS models yielded considerably lower absolute prediction errors than the regression models. Thus, the neuro‑fuzzy method provided significantly higher prediction accuracy than the multivariate regression approach. The results indicated that the neuro-fuzzy model constructed in this study using the uniaxial compressive strength ( σ c ), Schmidt rebound value ( R ), and porosity ( n ) as input parameters yielded the best predictions of E when compared to those predicted in some previous studies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The phenomenon of child begging has emerged as a visible and deeply troubling aspect of urban poverty worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Rooted in chronic child poverty and economic insecurity, this practice disproportionately affects vulnerable children. Although several studies have examined child begging in Ghana, few have examined children’s perspectives, and even fewer have focused exclusively on children’s perceptions of street begging. This study examines the experiences of child street beggars in inner-city Accra, Ghana, focusing on their living and sleeping arrangements, daily activities, and future aspirations. Methods This study used secondary qualitative data of 46 child street beggars in Accra. Data were analysed using thematic analysis to capture children’s narratives and experiences. Results Findings reveal that some child street beggars lived with their parents, while others lived with peers, siblings, or alone. Child street beggars living conditions were characterised by housing insecurity, poor sanitation, and heightened exposure to abuse. Despite these challenges, many child street beggars expressed aspirations to return to school, acquire vocational skills, or achieve economic self-reliance. Conclusions The study underscores the need for comprehensive, child-centred interventions that address structural poverty, strengthen child protection systems, and expand access to education and vocational training. Incorporating children’s voices is essential for developing effective and humane policy responses to child begging in urban Ghana.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The rapid evolution of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has transformed both civilian and defense sectors. However, unauthorized UAV use poses significant challenges to public safety and airspace regulation, highlighting the need for robust anti-drone defense systems. Such systems aim to detect, track, and mitigate/neutralize aerial threats. Detecting drones in complex environments remains challenging due to diverse operational conditions and ambient noise. Numerous acoustic signature-based deep learning methods have been proposed for reliable micro-drone detection. While these methods outperform traditional statistical signal processing techniques in detection accuracy, they are computationally intensive and require large amounts of training data. Hence, developing lightweight techniques that require less training data while maintaining comparable detection performance on real-time edge devices is essential. To achieve this, Autocorrelation Coefficients (temporal features) and Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (spectral features) are extracted from captured acoustic data. The integrated features are applied to multiple ensemble learning models, and their detection performance is evaluated, including the Random Forest algorithm, AdaBoost model, Extreme Gradient Boosting model, and Stacking Ensemble model. Experimental analysis shows that the Stacking Ensemble model achieves detection performance comparable to deep learning models while requiring lower computational complexity and reduced training data, attaining an overall detection accuracy of 98%. These findings demonstrate that integrating acoustic features with ensemble algorithms provides a reliable and scalable framework for real-time acoustic drone detection, making it a promising solution for next-generation aerial surveillance systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Food loss significantly impacts productivity, sustainability, and food security in common bean production systems. Dedicated research to investigate the contribution of specific smallholder farming practices to these losses in the Latin American context is still limited. This study addresses this gap by examining the practices of 56 common bean farmers from a characteristic production area in Costa Rica. The methodology includes four steps. The first, Screening , provides a preliminary overview of the context using secondary data, expert consultations, and local reports. The second, Survey , applies questionnaires and field observations to deepen understanding of food value chain actors, local conditions, and perceptions. The third, Sampling , derives from load tracking at different stages of the supply chain. Finally, the Synthesis step triangulates previous findings to identify causes and potential solutions to food loss. Results indicate that average productivity in the sample was 0,76 t/ha, which is only half of the global average (1,5 t/ha) due to intercropping, low seed rates and poor post-harvest storage facilities. Losses at harvest and post-harvest stages reached 12–18% of production and were more prevalent on farms relying on manual harvesting and minimal post-harvest infrastructure. These insights underscore the need for interventions to enhance mechanisation, adoption of technologies, and provision of productivity incentives for reducing food loss and food insecurity in common bean production systems. The successful application of the 4 S methodology sets an example for similar cases in the region, where diagnosis should be a first step for pertinent interventions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Observational studies have suggested strong correlations between obesity (as measured by body mass index [BMI]), lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, coffee intake, and insomnia, and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). However, the causal relationship between these factors and DCM remains unclear. Methods A two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to evaluate these associations. Genetic instruments significantly associated exposures (including BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, coffee intake, and insomnia) at the genome-wide significance threshold ( p &lt; 5 × 10⁻⁸) were selected from relevant genome-wide association studies. Summary-level data for DCM were obtained from the IEU Open GWAS project, comprising 1,444 cases and 353,937 controls. Results Genetically predicted BMI was positively associated with DCM (odds ratio [OR] per one standard deviation (SD) increase, 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4–2.1; p = 6.44 × 10 − 7 ). The OR for DCM was 31.86 (95% CI, 3.95–257.27; p = 0.001) for one SD increase in smoking. However, genetically predicted alcohol consumption, coffee intake, and insomnia were not significantly associated with the risk of DCM in our primary analysis. Conclusion Our findings suggest the potential causal links among BMI, smoking, and DCM, underscoring the importance of lifestyle interventions in managing DCM. This study also provides a foundation for future research aimed at identifying individuals highly at risk for DCM.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Urban beaches are fragile transitional environments increasingly exposed to anthropogenic pressures and natural degradation processes. This study presents for the first time an integrated environmental and morphosedimentary approach of the San Giovanni a Teduccio shoreline, an urban beach located in eastern Naples, Italy, integrating drone imagery, bathymetry, and sediment analysis. UAV-based photogrammetry and bathymetric surveys provided high-resolution spatial data, which were processed using GIS and interpolation tools to construct morphometric and bathymetric models. Surface sediment samples collected along beach transects were analyzed for granulometric composition, grain shape, and microplastic content. Shoreline change analysis revealed a consistent erosional trend, moderately sorted medium to coarse sands, and a high prevalence of anthropogenic debris. Despite urbanization, native psammophilous vegetation persists, playing a crucial role in ecosystem stability. The findings underscore the urgent need for ecologically sound coastal management strategies and offer a replicable framework for analyzing similar urban coastal systems under the pressures of the Anthropocene.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an established local therapy for inoperable colorectal cancer pulmonary metastases, with proven efficacy for lesions ≤ 3 cm. However, the optimal selection criteria, particularly for tumors sized 2–3 cm, remain unclear due to conflicting survival data. This single-center retrospective study (2016–2024) aimed to compare the long-term outcomes of RFA in 237 patients stratified by tumor diameter: Group 1 (≤ 2 cm, n = 126) and Group 2 (2–3 cm, n = 111). After a median follow-up of 40.6 months, Group 1 demonstrated a superior 5-year overall survival (OS) of 90.6% versus 69.4% in Group 2 ( P = 0.019). Yet, this association was not independent in multivariable analysis, where tumor size was confounded by factors including pleural distance and procedural complications. Notably, the 5-year local tumor progression (LTP) rate was significantly higher in Group 2 (26.4% vs. 12.2%, P = 0.00037). Multivariable analysis identified a lesion distance &gt; 1 cm from the pleura as an independent favorable prognostic factor for OS (HR = 0.42, P = 0.042), while post-RFA alveolar hemorrhage was a strong predictor of mortality (HR = 7.22, P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, RFA provides excellent local control and survival for metastases ≤ 2 cm, especially when located &gt; 1 cm from the pleura. For tumors sized 2–3 cm, the significantly higher LTP risk suggests that these patients may benefit from more aggressive strategies, such as combining RFA with adjuvant systemic therapy or considering alternative ablation modalities like microwave ablation.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are critical for transportation safety and efficiency but face serious security challenges due to limitations of traditional cryptography and emerging cyber threats. This paper proposes a novel reconciliation-free Physical Layer Key Generation (PKG) framework based on dynamic Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements and Triplet Networks (TN). Unlike conventional PKG schemes, the proposed approach eliminates reconciliation overhead while maintaining high entropy and strong resistance to eavesdropping. Realistic RSS is generated by integrating SUMO-based vehicular mobility with NS-3 network simulations, capturing spatiotemporal channel dynamics. The TN architecture extracts reciprocal channel features through hierarchical convolutional layers and optimized embedding spaces for secure key extraction. Experimental results show near-zero bit error rates between legitimate vehicles, high key entropy (0.69 bits/bit), and complete failure of eavesdroppers to reconstruct keys. Among 3,200 generated keys, 74.1% achieved perfect agreement without reconciliation, while eavesdroppers achieved 0% success. The proposed framework demonstrates a scalable, and robust security solution for VANET communications.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Sea surface height (SSH) is a critical parameter for characterizing ocean dynamics and understanding mesoscale eddies, surface currents, and subsurface thermohaline structures. Using along-track data from Haiyang-2B (HY-2B) as a reference, this study evaluated three SSH products for the year 2022 globally and in specific regions: the Copernicus Marine and Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) delayed-time (DT) merged gridded product, the CMEMS near-real-time (NRT) merged gridded product, and the Global Ocean Reanalysis and Simulation System (GLORYS) reanalysis product. The CMEMS DT product outperformed the others, achieving the lowest global root mean square error ( RMSE, 0.0267 m) and highest correlation, and demonstrated superior signal reconstruction, particularly in dynamically active regions such as the Kuroshio region. The NRT product offers reliable large-scale monitoring capability but shows higher errors in energetic regions, whereas GLORYS, despite its multivariate consistency, exhibits limited skill in resolving smaller-scale signals. For studies focusing on fine-scale and mesoscale features, the DT product is strongly recommended. For real-time large-scale applications, the NRT product is suitable with due regard to limitations in high-dynamic regions. Conversely, when employing GLORYS reanalysis in dynamically active areas, users should carefully evaluate its capacity to reproduce small- and mesoscale processes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The parathyroid glands are small but essential components of the endocrine system, regulating calcium and phosphate homeostasis through the secretion of parathyroid hormone. Their anatomical location is highly variable, ranging from the carotid bifurcation superiorly to the mediastinum inferiorly. This report presents a rare case of an ectopic parathyroid adenoma located entirely posterior to the left submandibular gland in a patient with primary hyperparathyroidism. Methods The patient underwent physical and laboratory evaluation followed by cervical ultrasound, planar scintigraphy, SPECT/CT, 4D CT, and 18 F-fluorocholine PET/CT. A left parathyroidectomy was subsequently performed under general anesthesia. In addition, a literature review covering the past 40 years was conducted to identify reports of parathyroid adenomas located behind the submandibular gland. Results Cervical ultrasound, planar scintigraphy, and SPECT/CT were reported as negative for the presence of pathological parathyroid tissue. A solid lesion was identified directly posterior to the left submandibular gland on 4D CT. On 18 F-fluorocholine PET/CT, the lesion demonstrated focal radiotracer uptake. The definitive diagnosis of an ectopic parathyroid adenoma was established by histopathological examination after surgical excision. A literature search identified three manuscripts relevant to the study objective; however, one was only partially applicable, while the remaining two provided limited imaging data. Conclusion Ectopic parathyroid adenomas in the submandibular region are uncommon, and as demonstrated by the literature review, complete posterior positioning behind the submandibular gland is exceptionally rare. This anatomical configuration reflects incomplete embryological descent of the parathyroid glands and, despite its rare occurrence, should be consistently considered in the diagnostic assessment of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism.

    "Abstract": "Abstract During the early twentieth century the rise of professional archaeology pushed the study of deep-time oral tradition into the fringes of historiography. The development of evidence-based archaeological chronologies displaced oral tradition, relying on the assumption that transmission processes include short-term limits on durability. By the end of the century, sporadic innovative partnership experiments brought together archaeological chronology and oral tradition, suggesting the need for further research. This article advances the narrative merging of oral tradition, archaeology, and genomic analysis. After surveying research on archery technology, it explores how the integrative aligning of oral tradition and archaeology can expand meaningful insights into antiquity worldwide. Although twenty-first century inquiry into deep-time oral literature unfolds in the shadowy academic fringes, perhaps such research is on the verge of professionalizing into new scholarship and a mutual enrichment of knowledge systems. Academic scholarship may someday see “prehistory” replaced by ancient human history.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Following a trend across the sciences, recent studies in lithic analysis have embraced the ideal of replicability. Recent large-scale studies have demonstrated that high replicability is achievable under controlled conditions and have proposed strategies to improve it in lithic data recording. Although this focus has yielded important methodological advances, we argue that an overemphasis on replicability risks narrowing the scope of archaeological inquiry. More specifically, we show (1) that replicability alone does not guarantee reliability, interpretive value, or cost effectiveness, and (2) that archaeological data often involve unavoidable ambiguity due to preservation, analyst background, and the nature of lithic variability itself. Instead of allowing replicability to dictate research priorities, we advocate for a problem-driven, pluralistic approach that tailors methods to research questions and balances replicable measures with interpretive depth. This has practical implications for training, publishing, and funding policy. We conclude that Paleolithic archaeology must engage with the replicability movement on its own terms—preserving methodological diversity while maintaining scientific credibility.",

    "Abstract": "Organizational ethical culture, though widely studied, lacks conceptual clarity and precision with levels of analysis. To diagnose the specific conceptual and levels limitations, we assess the state of the science of ethical culture by analyzing 155 articles. Analysis revealed conceptual disorganization, confusion between the conceptual domain and nomological network, and imprecise treatment of levels of analysis. These limitations have resulted in downstream problems with building and testing theory; existing research is affected by unfalsifiable hypotheses, conceptual invalidity, contamination among measures, and incorrect levels-based inferences. To help overcome these limitations, we present a revised definition that integrates the dynamic model of organizational culture with the concept of ethical affordances. We present a multilevel model and describe potential interactions that determine how and under what conditions ethical culture manifests at relevant levels. We conclude with recommendations that will help future research move past these limitations.",

    "Abstract": "According to the conventional wisdom among business ethicists, the “Business Judgment Rule” gives corporate leaders the discretion needed to abide by the firm’s moral obligations. In the first part of the paper, I challenge this view: managers have compelling reasons to believe that the Business Judgment Rule (and corporate law more generally) allows corporate leaders to pursue ethically motivated decisions only when these decisions are expected to be profit-enhancing. This is problematic because it instrumentalizes ethics, pushes ethically motivated corporate leaders to dissemble, and corrupts the quality of our public discourse. In response, I propose that corporate law should incorporate ethics into the Business Judgment Rule, explicitly giving managers discretion to make ethically motivated decisions that are profit-sacrificing. After responding to concerns about implementing such a rule, I contend that such a rule would be an important step to put corporate ethics in its proper place.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Many non-native invasive grass species increase wildfire activity and regenerate more quickly than native species. This invasive grass-fire cycle has severe negative consequences for ecosystems, creating a need to understand how different invasive grass species alter fuel characteristics and fire behavior, as well as effective treatments to control their abundance. To address these needs and increase fire and natural resource management preparedness, we performed a review and meta-analysis of recent (1985 – 2023) scientific literature. We focused on the Intermountain West, USA, where six dominant invasive grass species have already transformed ecosystems, including winter annuals – cheatgrass [ Bromus tectorum (L.)], medusahead [ Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski], red brome [ Bromus rubens (L.)], and Mediterranean grass [ Schismus arabicus Nees &amp; Schismus barbatus (Loefl. ex L.) Thell]; and summer perennials – buffelgrass [ Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link] and Lehmann’s lovegrass ( Eragrostis lehmanniana Nees). Of the 204 selected articles, B. tectorum was the most well-studied species, treatment effectiveness was the most common study type, and more studies addressed fuel accumulation than fire characteristics. While initial reductions in B. tectorum following wildfire were followed by large increases, P. ciliare initially increased and then steadily declined, and other invasive grass species had no significant post-fire changes over time. Chemical treatments were more effective than other treatments for B. tectorum , P. ciliare , and Schismus spp. , though T. caput-medusae had a larger reduction with chemical treatments compared to the other species. In many cases, treatment effectiveness was enhanced when treatment types were combined or repeat treatments were conducted. Both B. tectorum and T. caput-medusae increased to pre-treatment conditions within 3 and 5 years, respectively, though there were no detectable trends for other species. Our results provide comprehensive comparisons of the effect of invasive grass species on fuel and fire characteristics, and much needed insight on effective strategies for reducing their impact to ecosystems.",

Existing evidence-based treatments are linked to good prognosis and full recovery in many. For a small minority of critically ill patients, treatment decisions extend beyond voluntary engagement. Severe cases may involve involuntary hospitalisation, nasogastric feeding, physical restraint, and other coercive measures. While these interventions are sometimes necessary to prevent death, they raise profound ethical concerns. This article explores the ethical tensions in treatment of individuals with AN through the lens of the four principles of biomedical ethics, respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice, examining the implications for clinical practice. It also outlines the legal mechanisms in Ireland governing involuntary treatment for AN. It considers treatment principles in children and adolescents as well as adults.",

This article explores how and why an uncontested and unambiguous understanding of Chinese maritime history was suddenly rewritten in the modern world, becoming the accepted interpretation and shaping twenty-first century geopolitics. While scholars have weighed the veracity of Liuqiu as either Taiwan or Ryūkyū, this article focuses on how the Liuqiu–Taiwan thesis was produced and transmitted, showing how scientific methodology, imperialism, and nationalism worked to reshape geographical history. The article further contributes to an understanding of the shaping of the borders and claims of the modern Chinese nation: whereas scholars have investigated late Qing and early Republican debates over the western frontier and ethnicities, this article shows that questions over Taiwan were just as important.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract There has been a decade-long debate in the studies of Malaysian politics on whether there is indeed an urban–rural difference when it comes to elections. Studies using aggregated election data suggest stark differences in parties’ performance in urban and rural electoral districts, while studies relying on survey data tend to downplay urban–rural differences in voting patterns. Notwithstanding the ecological fallacy problem inherent in studies using aggregated election data, the consistent differences between studies using individual and aggregated data are puzzling, and cast a shadow over our understanding of electoral politics in Malaysia. This article argues that in Peninsular Malaysia the urban–rural differences supported by aggregated election data may have been overestimated due to results being driven by a few large urban centers. Combining survey data from the fifth wave of Asian Barometer and aggregated election data from the fourteenth general election in Malaysia, this article demonstrates that both kinds of data in fact point to the same conclusion. Once we specifically control for inter-state and local heterogeneity in population density, the association between population density and party performance attenuates.",

    "Abstract": "The cell body of flagellated microalgae is commonly considered to act merely as a passive load during swimming, and a larger body size would simply reduce the speed. In this work, we use numerical simulations based on a boundary element method to investigate the effect of body–flagella hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) on the swimming performance of the biflagellate Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . We find that body–flagella HIs significantly enhance swimming speed and efficiency. As body size increases, the competition between the enhanced HIs and the increased viscous drag leads to an optimal body size for swimming. Based on the simplified three-sphere model, we further demonstrate that the enhancement by body–flagella HIs arises from an effective non-reciprocity: the body affects the flagella more strongly during the power stroke, while the flagella affect the body more strongly during the recovery stroke. Our results have implications for both microalgal swimming and laboratory designs of biohybrid microrobots.",

    "Abstract": "In the present study, we introduce a new temperature transformation for compressible turbulent boundary layers with adiabatic and isothermal walls. Unlike existing transformations that rely on a single invariant function for the non-dimensional temperature gradient across the entire inner layer, a composite transformation strategy is proposed by leveraging two newly proposed Mach-number and wall-temperature invariant functions for the mean temperature field. This approach not only deploys appropriate Mach-number invariant functions in the viscous sublayer and the logarithmic region, but also introduces an improved solution to the long-standing singularity challenge inherent in single invariant function models. The performance of this composite transformation is verified by extensive direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets (26 cases) of compressible turbulent boundary-layer flows. The results demonstrate that the proposed transformation maps the mean temperature profiles to the incompressible reference without case-specific parameter tuning, exhibiting significantly reduced scatter when compared with the existing temperature transformations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The focus of existing research on perceived organizational support (POS) has largely been concentrated at the individual-level, leaving an understudied gap at a higher unit-level of analysis. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the multilevel relationship between employee POS and job satisfaction, emphasizing the moderating role of unit-level POS. We hypothesize, based on POS theory and social comparison theory, that unit-level POS serves as a contextual moderator for the relationship between individual-level POS and job satisfaction. Additionally, at the unit-level, we identify clan culture values and unit-satisfaction as correlates of unit-POS. We test our hypotheses using a Bayesian Multilevel Structural Modeling approach on 45 work units and 317 employees. The results show that at low levels of unit-level POS, individual-level POS is more important for employees’ job satisfaction. We furthermore found support for a positive association between unit-level POS, unit-clan culture, and unit satisfaction. Our results, and their notable theoretical and practical implications, are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are managed by owners, founders, or small leadership teams. The UK government’s Help to Grow Management Programme (HtGM) aims to improve SME growth through leadership and management skills training to increase firm level productivity. The government’s independent evaluation reports for the HtGM programme show that its aims were broadly met, but there is no empirical research that has reviewed the programme. To address this gap, 46 HtGM programme completers were interviewed on their perception of the HtGM outcomes. Data were analysed using thematic analysis and compared to the government’s evaluation reports. This study’s findings show that a variety of programme activities developed skills, knowledge, and management practices, resulting in improved confidence to lead and drive growth. The analysis adds depth to our understanding how this was achieved from the programme, highlighting the benefits of mentoring, networking and cross-collaboration. Follow-up support is recommended for the growth action plan (GAP).",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Blastoids have three primary systems providing entrances to blastoid hydrospires, the primary organ for respiration: (1) exposed hydrospire slits formed across the width of the radiodeltoid suture; (2) hydrospire pores formed at the aboral ends of the ambulacra; and (3) hydrospire tubules formed as invaginations along the radiodeltoid suture, becoming openings that pierce the radials and deltoids ontogenetically. Blastoid classification historically divided the blastoids into two groups—the Fissiculata and Spiraculata. The Fissiculata comprised those blastoids that have exposed hydrospire slits or spiracular slits. The Spiraculata had hydrospire pores and spiracles that connect internally to hydrospires. Spiraculate classification focused on the configuration of the spiracles and anispiracle in combination with thecal form. Spiracles are the adoral consequence of the ambulacra infilling the radial sinus and covering the hydrospires by the lancet and the side plates and are found in all spiraculate blastoids. In this revision of blastoid classification, we place primacy on the three mechanisms by which water is drawn into the hydrospires—hydrospire slits open to seawater, hydrospire pores, and hydrospire tubules. Hydrospire tubules are formed along the radiodeltoid suture, a very different ontogenetic position from hydrospire pores, which are formed at the aboral end of the ambulacrum, and a fundamental phylogenetic difference. We herein abandon the term Spiraculata and refer to the spiraculate grade as being the Stomatoblastida, new superorder for spiraculates with hydrospire pores and the Tubuloblastida, new superorder for spiraculates with hydrospire tubules. The Fissiculata is elevated to superordinal status.",

This qualitative study, informed by the neurodiversity paradigm, examines how Flexible Learning Options (FLOs) in South Australia address drivers of disengagement, such as sensory overload, punitive discipline, and identity erasure, while fostering reengagement through autonomy, relational safety, and identity empowerment. Drawing on interviews conducted with a subsample of 18 students aged 13–19, reflexive thematic analysis resulted in the development of three themes: (1) autonomy and its limits, (2) relational safety as harm reduction, and (3) identity empowerment through neuroaffirmation. The findings reported in this paper advocate for educational models that transform flexibility from a temporary solution into a blueprint for equity, ensuring schools become spaces of support rather than harm for neurodivergent learners.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract During World War I, national pride in France fostered solidarity and increased patriotism. However, after the war, the principles of self-determination and nationality reignited debates among young regionalists about federal reorganization in France and Europe. Federalism was seen as a way to promote peace in Europe and to protect national minorities within the state. This movement crystallized in 1927 when representatives from Alsace, Corsica, and Brittany established the Central Committee of National Minorities in France (CCMNF). The CCMNF advocated for self-determination and international federalism, suggesting that a federation of peoples could replace the modern state system. This structure would let each nationality decide its political status and cultural development. While the CCMNF marked a milestone in uniting minorities around federalist ideas, its efforts were slowed by the 1929 economic crisis and a resurgence of political tensions. This article examines the rise of regionalist federalism in 1920s France and its connection to the broader post-war discussions on self-determination. By placing this movement within the larger national debates on reorganizing the French state, it highlights federalism’s potential as a transformative framework for addressing political and cultural diversity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This article focuses on unilateral sovereignty referendums pursued by territorial autonomies. Due to their unilateral character, such referendums are unlikely to gain external recognition and, as a result, fail to effect or prevent any de jure change in sovereignty. However, they are still pursued despite these constraints, suggesting that they serve purposes other than formal changes in sovereignty. To explain this phenomenon, the article proposes a framework of seven potential motivations. The framework is examined through the case of Gagauzia’s 2014 referendums, which addressed two key issues: Moldova’s foreign alignment and Gagauzia’s deferred independence. The analysis follows three referendum stages — proposal, initiation, and implementation — focusing on the dual leadership of the executive and legislative branches. Drawing primarily on newspapers affiliated with these branches, the study finds empirical support for three key motivations: advancing the individual and collective political interests of autonomy leadership, strengthening Gagauzia’s ties with its patron (Russia), and empowering the territorial autonomy vis-à-vis the parent state (Moldova). This article contributes a framework of motivations for unilateral sovereignty referendums tailored specifically to territorial autonomies, going beyond existing explanations developed for all polities. It also provides a detailed account of one of the most significant political events in Gagauzia’s history.",

Drawing on fieldwork conducted between 2022 and 2023, the study explores how these groups navigate their distinct cultural markers, such as religion, language, and traditions, while engaging with the broader national identity. Using the theoretical framework of nationalization, the analysis explores four key themes: the salience of ethno-cultural differences, the transformation of sub-ethnic identities, the politicization of ethno-cultural markers, and the groups’ historical narratives emphasizing their contributions to Georgian-ness. The findings highlight the link between local identities and national integration. The findings contribute to broader theoretical debates on nationalization by demonstrating that the integration of sub-ethnic groups is not a unidirectional process of homogenization, but a dynamic negotiation of diversity and unity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Golden Dawn (GD), Greece’s most prominent far-right political organization, strategically utilized antisemitism as its core ideological principle rather than a marginal prejudice or rhetorical device. This article argues that antisemitism served primarily as an epistemological conspiratorial framework central to GD’s ideological worldview, providing a coherent interpretive lens through which all political, economic, and social phenomena were explained as elements of a singular Jewish-orchestrated plot. Drawing on qualitative discourse analysis of over 10,300 GD publications spanning 1993 to 2020, the study illustrates how this epistemological master frame enabled the party to unify diverse domestic and international issues, from foreign policy tensions and immigration debates to economic crises, under a consistent antisemitic narrative. Additionally, by explicitly employing Holocaust denial, endorsing Nazi symbolism, and openly propagating antisemitic conspiracies, GD deliberately violated post-Holocaust European norms. This normative transgression was integral to the party’s identity, positioning it in overt defiance of mainstream moral and political boundaries. The article thus demonstrates how GD’s antisemitism functioned not merely as a rhetorical provocation but as the foundation of a comprehensive ideological system that consciously challenged established European taboos. These findings also suggest broader implications for understanding the role and adaptability of conspiratorial antisemitism and normative transgression in other extremist ideologies beyond the Greek context.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract An important question in evolutionary biology and macroecology is whether taxa show systematic trajectories in occupancy, the proportion of geographic area occupied, over macroevolutionary timescales. Past studies have used fossils to document these trajectories, showing a symmetric rise and fall. In this study, I focus on several biases in the analyses of fossil occupancy trajectories that have been unaccounted for. First, better sampling of boundary bins in a taxon’s stratigraphic range, paradoxically, results in lower mean occupancy of taxa in those bins. This is because better sampling allowed more taxa with low occupancies to be included in the mean occupancies of those bins compared with intermediate bins. Second, the possibility that taxa may have incomplete durations within boundary bins could also lower occupancies in those bins. Finally, a bias can also exist when the number of sampled sites is not constant throughout a taxon’s stratigraphic range. I use simulations to show that the first bias can be corrected by conditioning these boundary bins to be sampled in the same way as intermediate bins. To mitigate the second bias, I use higher-resolution time bins to constrain the intervals over which taxa’s occupancies are measured so that they are comparable between boundary and intermediate time bins. I also present an approach that can correct for the last bias by subsampling geographic sites, testing its impact in a simulation. Considering these factors, the occupancy trajectories of marine animal genera look to be a relatively gradual rise post-origination with a sudden decline before extinction.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Vitamin B6 is implicated in multiple mental disorders, and accumulating evidence suggests an inverse relationship with depression; however, important aspects of the underlying dose–response patterns and the roles of individual circulating vitamin B6 metabolites remain incompletely understood. We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005–2010. Depression was defined as a Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score ≥10. Vitamin B6 status was assessed using serum pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), the biologically active coenzyme form, and 4-pyridoxic acid (PA), the principal catabolic and urinary excretion product of vitamin B6. Among 12,620 participants, 1,070 (8.5%) met criteria for depression. After adjusting for relevant covariates, multiple logistic regression revealed that individuals in higher quartiles of serum PLP and PA (Q2-Q4) had significantly lower odds of depression compared to those in the lowest quartile (Q1). Restricted cubic spline analyses identified nonlinear relationships: L-shaped for PLP (P-nonlinearity=0.001) and U-shaped for PA (P-nonlinearity=0.017). Below the inflection points (90.7 nmol/L for PLP; 73.9 nmol/L for PA), both metabolites showed significant inverse associations with depression (PLP: OR=0.992, 95%CI: 0.988–0.996, P&lt;0.001; PA: OR=0.994, 95%CI: 0.993–0.996, P&lt;0.001). Above these thresholds, the association became non-significant for PLP (P=0.353), while PA demonstrated a positive association with depression (OR=1.008, 95%CI: 1.002–1.013, P&lt;0.01). Subgroup analyses confirmed the robustness of these inverse associations across demographic categories. Serum vitamin B6 metabolites, PLP and its excretion product PA, exhibit non-linear associations with depression, with distinct threshold effects and metabolite-specific patterns that likely reflect both vitamin B6 availability and turnover.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Maternal obesity delays mammary gland maturation, influencing milk composition and neonatal growth. This study investigated whether supplementation of obese rats with resveratrol (Res) improves mammary gland differentiation, milk composition, and offspring development. Female Wistar rats were fed either a high-fat diet, to induce maternal obesity (MO) or standard chow as control (C). One month before mating, and throughout gestation, half the rats received 20 mg/kg/day Res orally creating 2 additional experimental groups (CRes and MORes). Milk nutrients and fatty acids were analyzed at postnatal day 21 (PND21); maternal body composition, mammary gland weight, and fat pad weight were also obtained. Mammary gland morphology and indices of apoptosis were determined. Offspring metabolic parameters were studied at PND36. MO dams had increased adiposity, mammary gland weight and showed elevated glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels compared to controls. MORes reduced all these parameters except mammary gland weight. Mammary gland development was delayed, and apoptosis increased in MO vs C. Resveratrol improved mammary gland development in obese dams. Milk protein/fat ratio, milk, protein and DHA intake decreased in the MO group compared to C; whereas, fat, saturated fat, monosaturated fat and ω-6 fatty acid was increased in MO. Reveratrol treatment restored these parametes in obese dams and significantly reduced adiposity in their offspring. Triglycerides, insulin and HOMA-IR increased in MO offspring but was prevented by Res, which also increased milk intake in controls. Conclusion, preconceptional Resvertrol supplementation protects against the negative effects of maternal obesity on mammary gland differentiation, milk composition and offspring metabolism.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Childhood undernutrition is a global public health challenge, affecting children unevenly within the same household. This study assessed the behavioural and genetic correlates of malnutrition among children aged 1–3 years in a district of the Greater Accra Region, Ghana. A cross-sectional study involving 262 child-caregiver pairs was conducted. Children were classified as wasted, stunted or healthy based on anthropometric indices. Feeding behaviours - including appetite, food refusal, force-feeding, and maternal feeding anxiety were assessed using the International Complementary Feeding Evaluation Tool. Saliva samples were used to genotype nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with appetite and energy regulation, and a polygenic risk score (PGRS) was generated. Wasted children had significantly lower appetite z-scores (Mean difference MD (Confidence interval CI)): -0.37 (-0.65, -0.09) and higher z-scores for food refusal (0.30 (0.03, 0.58)) and caregiver feeding anxiety (0.67 (0.39, 0.94)) compared to healthy children. Maternal feeding anxiety attenuated the association between appetite and WHZ while remaining a strong independent predictor. No associations were found between feeding behaviour and stunting. Although force-feeding was common (33% of children), it did not differ by nutritional status. The SNP rs2274333, showed a higher frequency of homozygosity for the AA genotype in wasted children. The PGRS was significantly associated with low appetite (p=0.046) but not with food refusal or nutritional status. Children with wasting had a lower appetite and a higher food refusal. This is associated with high levels of maternal feeding anxiety, but does not seem to have a strong genetic basis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The legume pod borer, Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), is one of the pervasive and destructive pests of legume crops, causing significant yield losses. In this study, we evaluated the nutritional performance and digestive enzyme activities of H. armigera when fed on ten mung bean varieties, including Baghmalek, India, Veys, Omrani, Parto, Simite1, Simite2, VC6371, VC3960, and VC6368. Additionally, biochemical profiling of these mung bean varieties, assessing starch, protein, anthocyanin, total phenolic and flavonoid content, was conducted to explore potential correlations with the nutritional physiology of H. armigera . The findings indicated that the larvae fed on Parto had lowest approximate digestibility, efficiency of conversion of ingested food, and relative growth rate, while those fed on VC6371 had the highest values. The values of efficiency of conversion of digested food were lower on Baghmalek and Parto and higher on VC6368 and VC6371. The lowest value of larval gain weight was on Parto. The highest proteolytic and amylolytic activities of larvae were observed on Veys and India, respectively; while the lowest enzyme activities were recorded on Parto. Our findings indicate that the low protein content combined with high levels of anthocyanin, total phenolics, and flavonoids may contribute to the potential tolerance of mung bean varieties against H. armigera . Cluster analysis revealed that VC6368 and VC6371 were the most suitable varieties for H. armigera development, whereas Baghmalek and Parto were nutritionally less suitable and may severe as promising candidates for breeding or cultivation to minimise damage caused by this pest.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This article is about the recent transformation of two powerful, paradoxical, and inseparable narratives of progress that developed in the postwar period: aesthetic autonomy and Holocaust remembrance. As far-right and illiberal parties have gained power across Europe, they adapted these foundational narratives of the liberal-democratic West to assert their own legitimacy and to reimagine the cultural inclinations of the European Union. This article examines how this process has taken place in the reception of Jonathan Glazer's Zone of Interest (2023) and Agnieszka Holland's Green Border (2023)—both international co-productions produced during the repressive eight-year reign of the Law and Justice Party (PiS) in Poland. A close reading of these films and their reception in different contexts, exposes a world more complicated than one-dimensional dichotomies between the liberal and the illiberal. Likewise, the reception of the two films makes apparent the entanglement of the national and transnational, as well as a process of translation and mistranslation that takes place as cultural materials move across geographical and ideological boundaries. Understanding such dynamics helps us to comprehend the options for criticism available to artists working within repressive contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study tested the effects of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ( MTHFR ) rs110692574 polymorphism and rumen-protected choline and methionine supplementation on biochemical parameters, milk yield, reproductive performance and health status during the transition period in Holstein cows raised in Türkiye. Genotypes of 356 cows were determined using the tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system–polymerase chain reaction (ARMS-PCR) method. Following genotyping, 80 cows were selected and assigned to four groups based on nucleotide genotype at two loci (homozygous CC and heterozygous CT) and dietary supplement (choline or choline + methionine). Blood samples were collected on day 21 prepartum, on the day of parturition (day 0), and on day 21 postpartum to measure homocysteine, folic acid, vitamin B12, and non-esterified fatty acid concentrations. beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) values and production data were obtained from the farms’ routine monitoring records. Statistical analyses were performed using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to assess time-dependent effects, and a general linear model was used for between-group comparisons at the same time points. The frequency of the CT genotype was 12.64%. The polymorphism significantly affected folic acid and vitamin B12 concentrations across different stages of the transition period. Feed supplementation had a significant effect on folic acid concentrations on calving day and on day 21 postpartum, as well as on milk yield on days 100, 200 and 305. Moreover, the polymorphism was significantly associated with folic acid and vitamin B12 concentrations on day 21 prepartum and with BHBA values on day 7 postpartum. This variation was linked to specific health issues that could lead to decreased productivity. In conclusion, genotype-based nutritional strategies were found to play a key role in maintaining metabolic balance and enhancing productivity during the transition period.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Biological invasions can impact the dynamics of ecological processes. For primates of the genus Callithrix , congeneric introductions and hybridization are one of the greatest threats to native species. Three species of Callithrix have been recorded in Rio Doce State Park in south-east Brazil: the Endangered native buffy-tufted-ear marmoset Callithrix aurita and two introduced marmosets, the Geoffroy’s tufted-ear marmoset Callithrix geoffroyi and the black-pencilled marmoset Callithrix penicillata , but their relative abundance was unknown. We used the call playback method and adapted N-mixture models to estimate the abundance and of these marmosets in relation to canopy cover, tree circumference, tree density, number of lianas and epiphytes per tree, distances to nearest forest edge, road, tourist area and urban area, and detection probability in relation to survey effort, mean daily precipitation and temperature. We recorded 139 individuals (0.12 individuals/ha), all hybrids except for one C. aurita . Marmoset abundance was higher close to the forest edge, possibly as a result of the greater availability of food and shelter there. Detection probability was positively correlated with daily precipitation, most probably because marmosets foraged more actively when humidity was high. The situation in Rio Doce State Park is critical, with high hybridization levels and potential local extinction of C. aurita . We recommend that a management plan to conserve the remaining C. aurita is implemented urgently.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The concepts of ‘dangerous’, ‘celebratory’, and ‘hegemonic’ multilingualism provide a valuable heuristic to explore language ideologies within supranational organizations like the United Nations. Adopting a critical stance in relation to the functions and values assigned to multilingualism and applying corpus-assisted discourse analysis, this study examines three ideological manifestations: verbalizations, metapragmatic acts, and linguistic practices in United Nations debates on the 1995 multilingualism resolution. The study analyses how member state representatives index their ideological stance: metadiscursively via verbalizations within the context of language policy debates, via acts of voting, and via their use of multilingualism as positioning devices within these debates. Unlike previous investigations of language ideology which have predominantly and exclusively focussed on discursive analyses of texts, this article forwards a tripartite analytic framework. We argue that this model serves to afford a holistic examination of practised and stated attitudes towards multilingualism, which in turn have consequences for language policy outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Refugee and forced migration studies scholars largely ignore the early modern period when they discuss modern refugee crises, thus overlooking the transhistorical, cultural origins of refugee identity formation. Following Louis XIV’s Revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, around 200,000 Huguenots fled France for the wider diaspora. Often depicted as republicans, if not anarchists, bent on the destruction of Christianity and the French sacral monarchy, Huguenots sought refuge for their own safety and in the process reimagined themselves first as religious refugees and then as political ones. As religious refugees, Huguenots like the theologian Pierre Jurieu donned the mantle of the Ancient Israelites, as a means to maintain their community against French purgation of the Calvinist sect. As political refugees, Huguenots like Rabaut Saint-Étienne developed several strategies at courting the favor of the Bourbon monarchy, many of which challenged the French sacral state to imagine itself in secular terms. In developing a political refugee identity, these Huguenots created the empathetic, cultural refugee, which could transcend religious affiliation in favor of promoting a national identity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Treaties are the most visible, some would even say the ‘main source of international law’. This is true not only at the global level, but even more so in Europe. However, these treaties hardly explain the idiosyncratic, sometimes exceptionalist ways in which international law is identified, interpreted, and applied in this region. Still less do they explain the disproportionate normative influence of European legal rules outside Europe. Attributing these particularities and imbalances to ‘eurocentrism’ in international law is considered almost a truism these days. Yet, when examining how the European legal tradition translates into positive international law one category of rules has received little attention so far: the unwritten European rules that are resorted to within and beyond Europe. The idea of ‘unwritten’ European rules is not only historically charged but also conceptually vague. However, this article argues that a close analysis of their role is central to both understanding and overcoming the persistence of ‘eurocentrism’ in international law. To demonstrate this claim, the article introduces the term ‘unwritten’ European rules in international law. A historical section illustrates their ambivalent role since the beginning of the nineteenth century. It then analyses the continuing relevance of unwritten European rules in contemporary legal practice. The final section discusses how a common framework of secondary rules can help to distinguish between hegemonic and integrative uses of unwritten European rules, before concluding.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the regions in Antarctica that has experienced notable and extensively studied warming since the mid-twentieth century. Meteorological data, although limited and mostly dating back to the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), reveal dramatic climate changes in both the Antarctic Peninsula and West Antarctica, with the Antarctic Peninsula showing the highest warming trends on the continent. One major manifestation of this warming is the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme warm events. This study utilizes temperature data from the Artigas Antarctic Scientific Base provided by National Weather Service, Uruguayan Institute of Meteorology (INUMET), which have not previously been used or quality-controlled. Data were processed and analysed, and a quality hourly database was built for the period 1 January 1998 to 11 December 2016 for the surface temperature, constructing a complete time series interpolating the data with two other nearby Antarctic stations (C.M.A. Eduardo Frei Montalva and King Sejong). Temperature presented an annual cycle with marked interannual and seasonal variability, with the cold season being the one with the highest variability and the largest anomalies, both positive and negative. No significant trend was found for the monthly mean temperature. A study of warm temperature events was conducted at three points on King George Island, defining warm events and extreme warm events as those in which the mean daily temperature was above the 90th and 99th percentile, respectively, for at least 3 consecutive days. A high frequency of occurrence was found (all years except 2015) mostly in the cold season of the year, and with large interannual variability. In turn, it was found that certain atmospheric dynamics favour the generation of these extreme warm events, and that their occurrence is higher during La Niña years. Although the majority of the extreme warm events occurred during positive phases of the Southern Annular Mode, the statistical correlations were not significant.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This work compares the use of palace diplomacy and propaganda by the rulers of Constantinople and Mexico-Tenochtitlan. It builds on studies of the cultural exchange between the Roman and Sasanian empires from the third to sixth centuries a.d. , which led to a diplomatic protocol shared by these two realms. This protocol and Liudprand of Cremona’s account of diplomatic receptions are the basis for comparative analysis. Drawing on Hernando Alvarado Tezozómoc’s Crónica Mexicana and other sixteenth-century sources, this study identifies key characteristics of diplomacy in Mesoamerica. It explores how Mexico-Tenochtitlan employed palace diplomacy and propaganda from the reign of Motecuhzoma Ilhuicamina to Motecuhzoma Xocoyotzin. Through this analysis, we find that the diplomatic and propaganda objectives of Constantinople and Mexico-Tenochtitlan had distinct focuses. The Byzantine rulers aimed to maintain their existing empire, while the Tenochca rulers sought not only to preserve but also to expand their domain. As a result, Constantinople’s strategy emphasized palace diplomacy, whereas Mexico-Tenochtitlan’s focused more on propaganda. Despite these differences, both approaches share several similarities. Both began with invitations, and their protocols included the same components: visual (architecture, wealth, and terror), ceremonial (including aural, olfactory, gustatory, ludic, haptic, somatic, and terror elements), and diplomatic (interviews and gift exchanges).",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This article revisits the concept of the instrument’s inherent score , exploring how musical instruments can embody a form of notation that both shapes and inspires performance. Building on earlier research (Tomás 2016; Tomás and Kaltenbrunner 2014), the study examines the historical and theoretical foundations of this idea, tracing its roots to experimental music practices of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly within the Sonic Arts Union collective. Composers such as Alvin Lucier, Gordon Mumma and Nicolas Collins have described how electronic instruments embody compositional elements, effectively functioning as scores. The paper argues that the instrument’s score emerges from the material and symbolic affordances of the instrument, mediating the performer’s engagement with its sonic and physical properties. This concept has influenced contemporary digital instrument design, where the boundary between composition and instrument becomes blurred. The study also engages with theoretical frameworks from Vilém Flusser and Friedrich Kittler, situating the instrument’s score within broader discourses on technology and embodiment. Finally, the paper explores the challenges of notating such scores, drawing parallels with choreographic practices, and concludes by emphasising the body’s central role in interpreting and enacting these inscriptions during performance.",

Design A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on five categories of prepackaged food products. Label components were classified using the INFORMAS labelling taxonomy. Products’ nutritional profile was evaluated using Health Canada’s FOP symbol nutrient thresholds for saturated fats, sugars and sodium. Setting Data were obtained from the Food Quality Observatory database, collected between 2018 and 2022 from food retailers in Québec City and the Greater Montreal Area or online. Participants A total of 2,937 food products were evaluated from five food categories: Breakfast cereals (n=392), Cookies and granola bars (n=983), Flavoured milks and plant-based alternative beverages (n=202), Salty snacks and crackers (n=1063) and Yogurts and plant-based yogurt alternatives (n=297). Results Overall, 74.2% of food products had a NHC and 28.9% had a NHC and would require to display the FOP symbol. Food products that would require the FOP symbol were less likely to carry a NHC. Conclusions The results demonstrate substantial use of marketing techniques highlighting positive product attributes. Given the potential for inconsistent messaging on food products carrying NHC and the FOP symbol, these results highlight an opportunity to improve Canadian labelling regulations by restricting the use of NHC on products high in saturated fats, sugars and/or sodium.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective: Existing evidence suggests a potential association between coffee consumption and Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD，now known as MASLD), yet the nature of this relationship remains ambiguous. The primary objective of this study was to comprehensively investigate and clarify the association between coffee intake and the occurrence of NAFLD. Design: A cross-sectional study design was employed, analyzing data from NHANES(National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,NHANES) spanning from 2013 to 2018. Weighted univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were utilized to assess the relationship between coffee consumption and NAFLD. RCS analysis was conducted to explore any potential nonlinear associations. Forest plots were generated to visualize the impact of coffee consumption on NAFLD across different subgroups, and threshold effect analysis was performed to evaluate the nonlinear relationship between coffee consumption and NAFLD prevalence specifically in women. Setting: Data were from the US - representative NHANES. Participants: 8062 subjects aged ≥20 years were included. Results: The weighted prevalence of NAFLD among the participants was 44.18%. After controlling for confounding variables, coffee consumption was found to be negatively associated with the risk of NAFLD (OR = 0.96, 95%CI: 0.94, 0.99). The association between coffee consumption and NAFLD was observed to vary by gender and education level. For the prevention of NAFLD in women, the optimal coffee intake was determined to be 2 cups. Conclusions: Increasing coffee intake emerges as a potentially effective non-pharmacological strategy for the prevention and management of NAFLD. Notably, for women, consuming 2 cups of coffee appears to represent the optimal threshold for maximizing this beneficial effect.",

As a consequence, the unique measure of maximal entropy is the Monge-Ampère of a Hölder continuous plurisubharmonic function and has strictly positive Hausdorff dimension. Under the same assumptions, we also prove that the Green currents are woven. When they are of bidegree $(1,1)$ , they are laminar. In particular, our results generalize results known until now only in algebraic settings, or in dimension 2.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Recent scholarship locates the origins of modern free trade policies in the early modern free port movement. This historiography has focused on the intellectual and political history of free ports and emphasized the importance of local and regional factors in shaping trade liberalizations in different European countries and colonies. Based on evidence from eighteenth-century Hamburg, this article proposes a different reading: it argues that free trade policies emerged in response to Atlantic trade expansion. The sources suggest that merchants and magistrates were aware of the monumental change which the growth of the Atlantic trade presented and the economic opportunities it provided. The liberalization of individual ports aimed to capture a greater share of that commerce. Free ports therefore constitute an early example of global economic change driving local European policymaking.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The continued applicability of international human rights law in situations of armed conflict entails that the right to mental health also applies. It is therefore crucial to examine how human rights supervisory mechanisms engage with this right in such contexts. Building on this premise, the present paper investigates how United Nations treaty bodies address mental health in conflict and post-conflict settings in their Concluding Observations. The study is based on a textual analysis of these documents conducted through the Universal Human Rights Index database. The findings reveal that most recommendations contained in the Concluding Observations call for particular attention to the mental health of children, especially child combatants, and of women, particularly those who are victims of sexual and gender-based violence. In terms of action required, they emphasize the need to ensure the availability and accessibility of mental health and psychosocial support services to persons affected by conflict.",

    "Abstract": "Aggregation-induced emission electrochemiluminescence (AIE-ECL) has emerged as a promising strategy for aqueous-phase detection and sensing by overcoming aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) and poor water solubility. However, the relatively low ECL efficiency of existing systems limits broader applications due to the intrinsic molecular rotatability of ECL emitters. In this work, we designed and synthesized a heptagonal diimide-based luminophore, DMAC-BPI, which exhibits outstanding ECL efficiency due to its well-balanced rigidity and rotatability. This AIE-ECL system demonstrated an ultrahighly sensitive and selective response toward lithium ions (Li<sup>+</sup>) in salt-lake environments, with a detection limit as low as 5.7 μM. This study not only addresses the challenge of insufficient AIE-ECL efficiency at the molecular design level but also provides a highly efficient strategy for detecting the strategic resource Li<sup>+</sup> in salt lakes.",

    "Abstract": "Dynamic molecular crystals with inherent conformational flexibility could offer a promising platform for fluorescence sensing by exhibiting analyte-specific conformational and fluorescence responses. Herein, we materialize this notion through a donor-acceptor (D-A) molecule featuring a D-D-A-D-D backbone, with a thiadiazolopyridine acceptor flanked by carbazole donors. The molecule self-assembles into crystalline nanofibers endowed with a dynamic conformational twisting capability, which arises from the synergistic effect of the unique A group's electrostatic repulsion and the spatial freedom provided by the alkyl chains. This dynamic nature is validated by a rapid and reversible emission toggle between yellow and red upon cycling exposure to and evaporation of solvents like <i>n</i>-hexane. Crucially, the dynamic nanofibers also allow analyte binding to drive specific conformational changes, thereby perturbing intermolecular interactions and yielding distinct fluorescence responses. These responses, including variations in kinetics and intensity, enable the multiplexed discrimination of amines with high selectivity and sensitivity against humidity and background volatile organic compounds. The dynamic nanofibers function robustly in complex environments such as hair spray and car exhaust, and exhibit high sensitivity toward amine-type drugs, with detection limits as low as 1 ng for methamphetamine and fentanyl. This work underscores the potential of dynamic molecular crystals to deliver substantially expanded signal diversity for advanced sensing applications.",

    "Abstract": "The planetary-scale risks posed by \"chemicals of global concern\" have deep historical roots that predate the literature on the Planetary Boundaries concept. Two largely separate scientific and regulatory tracks emerged from mid-20th-century research: an atmospheric track (exemplified by chlorofluorocarbons and stratospheric ozone depletion) and an aquatic-terrestrial/ecotoxicological track (exemplified by DDT, PCBs and other bioaccumulative organohalogens). Both tracks produced early warnings, scientific consensus, and eventual multilateral environmental agreements (the Montreal Protocol and Stockholm Convention). In this Perspective, we synthesize the historical evidence, link it to the planetary-boundaries and limits-to-growth narratives, highlight why chemical regulation repeatedly failed to prevent widespread contamination, and propose a set of pragmatic policy instruments, including targeted premarket controls such as the application of the Safe and Sustainable by Design framework, class-based phase-outs to speed up the removal of hazardous substances from the market, and global burden sharing to better manage planetary-scale chemical problems.",

Structure-activity relationships were determined by integrating measurements (water solubility, surface tension, molecular volume) with in-silico descriptors (<i>n</i>-octanol-water partition coefficient, log <i>K</i><sub>OW</sub>; bioconcentration factor, log BCF; asymmetry). Lipophilicity and bioaccumulation correlated with fresh-mass inhibition (EC<sub>50</sub>). More-fluorinated, larger, and charge-delocalized anions were more hydrophobic, elevating bioaccumulation and toxicity. Within menthol-based series, sulfonylimide-based FILs were more phytotoxic (EC<sub>50</sub> 74.7, 107.3 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> soil dry weight) than sulfonate analogues (e.g., 299.1 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>). FILs with linear cations were more phytotoxic and showed higher log <i>K</i><sub>OW</sub>/BCF than cyclic analogues, consistent with greater molecular volume, higher asymmetry, and reduced hydration.

This paper summarized the applications of photoactive nanomaterials for reducing food risk factors (e.g., mycotoxin detoxification, pesticide decomposition, and food pigments).

Furthermore, the preparation of antibacterial agents and membrane materials based on photoactive nanomaterials, and their applications in the fields of antibacterial field and food preservation, were also reviewed. Additionally, the development of the selective photocatalytic systems that possess both high catalytic efficiency and good food matrix compatibility was discussed in this paper.

    "Abstract": "Predicting protein-membrane interactions is a formidable challenge due to the subtle physicochemical features that distinguish membrane-binding regions of a protein surface as well as the scarcity of experimentally resolved membrane-bound protein conformations. Here, we present MaSIF-PMP, a geometric deep learning model that leverages molecular surface fingerprints to predict interfacial binding sites (IBSs) of peripheral membrane proteins (PMPs). MaSIF-PMP integrates geometric and chemical surface features to produce spatially resolved IBS predictions. Compared to existing models, MaSIF-PMP achieves superior performance for IBS classification, while feature ablation studies and transfer learning analyses reveal distinct determinants governing protein-membrane versus protein-protein interactions. We further show that molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can validate model predictions, refine IBS labels, and capture composition-dependent membrane binding patterns. These results establish MaSIF-PMP as an effective framework for IBS prediction and highlight the potential of incorporating conformational dynamics from MD to improve both the model accuracy and biological interpretability.",

    "Abstract": "Identifying transition states (TSs), the high-energy configurations that molecules pass through during chemical reactions, is essential for understanding and designing chemical processes. However, accurately and efficiently identifying these states remains one of the most challenging problems in computational chemistry. In this work, we introduce a new generative AI approach that improves the quality of initial guesses for TS structures. Our method can be combined with a variety of existing techniques, including both machine-learning models and fast, approximate quantum methods, to refine their predictions and bring them closer to chemically accurate results. Applied to TS guesses from a state-of-the-art machine-learning model, our approach reduces the median structural error to 0.077 Å and lowers the median absolute error in reaction barrier heights to 0.40 kcal mol<sup>-1</sup>. When starting from a widely used tight-binding approximation, it increases the success rate of locating valid TSs by 41% and speeds up high-level quantum optimization by a factor of 3. By making TS searches more accurate, robust, and efficient, this method could accelerate reaction mechanism discovery and support the development of new materials, catalysts, and pharmaceuticals.",

The generated force fields showed enhanced structural stability within the metalated base pairs, with the coordinated metal rotating into the major groove. Our findings show a higher propeller angle associated with the metalated base pair, which agrees with previously reported experimental data.

    "Abstract": "Assessing the time scale of biological processes using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with sufficient statistical accuracy is a challenging task, as processes are often rare and/or slow events, which may extend largely beyond the time scale of what is accessible with modern day high performance computational infrastructure. Recently, the replica exchange partial path transition interface sampling (REPPTIS) algorithm was developed to study rare and slow events involving metastable states along their reactive pathways. REPPTIS is a path sampling method where paths are cut short to reduce the computational cost, while combining this with the efficiency offered by replica exchange between the partial path ensembles. However, REPPTIS still lacks a formalism to extract time-dependent properties, such as mean first passage times, fluxes, and rates, from the short partial paths. In this work, we introduce a Markov state model (MSM) framework to estimate full path lengths and kinetic properties from the overlapping partial paths generated by REPPTIS. The framework results in newly derived closed formulas for the REPPTIS crossing probability, mean first passage times (MFPTs), flux, and rate constant. Our approach is then validated using simulations of Brownian and Langevin particles on a series of one-dimensional potential energy profiles as well as the dissociation of KCl in solution, demonstrating that REPPTIS accurately reproduces the exact kinetics benchmark. The MSM framework is further applied to the trypsin-benzamidine complex to compute the dissociation rate as a test case of a biological system, albeit the computed rate underestimates the experimental value. In conclusion, our MSM framework equips REPPTIS simulations with a robust theoretical and practical foundation for extracting kinetic information from computationally efficient partial paths.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, we present enhanced representation-based sampling (ERBS), a novel enhanced sampling method designed to generate structurally diverse training data sets for machine-learned interatomic potentials. ERBS automatically identifies collective variables by dimensionality reduction of atomic descriptors and applies a bias potential inspired by the On-the-Fly probability enhanced sampling framework. We highlight the ability of Gaussian moment descriptors to capture collective molecular motions and explore the impact of biasing parameters using alanine dipeptide as a benchmark system. We show that free energy surfaces can be reconstructed with high fidelity using only short biased trajectories as training data. Further, we apply the method to the iterative construction of a liquid water data set and compare the quality of simulated self-diffusion coefficients for models trained with molecular dynamics and ERBS data. Further, we active-learn models for liquid water with and without enhanced sampling and compare the quality of simulated self-diffusion coefficients. The self-diffusion coefficients closely match those simulated with a reference model at a significantly reduced data set size. Finally, we compare the sampling behavior of enhanced sampling methods by benchmarking the mean squared displacements of BMIM<sup>+</sup>BF<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> trajectories simulated with uncertainty-driven dynamics and ERBS and find that the latter significantly increases the exploration of configurational space.",

    "Abstract": "The main protease (Mpro/3CLpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus activates the viral nonstructural proteins (nsp) into functional units inside the host cells and kickstarts the viral replication-translation machinery, acting as a central molecular switch. Each Mpro monomer possesses 12 cysteine residues, none of them participating in disulfide bridge formation in the active state. However, as a form of protection in response to oxidation, Cys145, a component of the Mpro catalytic dyad, may form a disulfide linkage with Cys117 alongside the formation of the NOS/SONOS bridge involving Cys22, Cys44, and Lys61. These redox-induced thiol group modifications, especially the disulfide cross-linking, impart a transient dormancy on the enzyme's catalytic function, which is restored under reducing conditions. In our study, Raman spectroscopy was used to explore the conformational heterogeneity of Mpro cysteines by analyzing the molecular fingerprint of various thiol cross-link rotamers and free cysteine SH bond vibrations. At ambient pH 7.8, distinct disulfide bond vibration signals were observed at ∼510 cm<sup>-1</sup> (GGG) and ∼553 cm<sup>-1</sup> (TGT), alongside an S-H stretch at ∼2564 cm<sup>-1</sup> in the Raman spectra (ex. 532 nm) of the air-oxidized protein sample. Evidence for NOS(nitroso-sulfenamide)/SONOS bridges emerged in the 650-900 cm<sup>-1</sup> region, with the N-O bond stretching vibration mode centered at ∼885 cm<sup>-1</sup>. The results validated the presence of both oxidized and reduced conformers of the purified wild-type Mpro in vitro at any given time. Furthermore, the Raman molecular fingerprint of the main protease gives a detailed account of the physical states of various side chain residues and the protein secondary structure and stability by depicting a relatively broad amide 1 band at 1660 cm<sup>-1</sup>, having a full width at half maxima (FWHM) of ∼52 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Further analysis indicates that about 40% residues are in α-helical (marker band at 1655 cm<sup>-1</sup>) conformation space, and β-sheet (component band at ∼1670 cm<sup>-1</sup>) preferring residue was about 25% of the total protein content. Raman spectra and intrinsic fluorescence further systematically mapped the specific microenvironment of tryptophan and tyrosine residues and their critical involvement in hydrogen bond formation that significantly contributes to the overall stability and function of the main protease.",

    "Abstract": "Shale gas, as a clean unconventional hydrocarbon resource, faces significant challenges in safe and efficient development due to wellbore instability. Traditional drilling fluid strategies primarily rely on density control, inhibition, and plugging but are insufficient to prevent shale structural degradation caused by fluid invasion. Calcite, an important brittle mineral in shale, is highly susceptible to dissolution and structural damage. Its role in wellbore stability thus warrants an in-depth investigation. In this study, calcite in shale was selected as the research focus, and a combination of molecular simulation and experimental approaches was employed to systematically screen the interfacial interactions of representative organic functional groups with calcite to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The results show significant differences in interfacial interaction strength among functional groups, with adsorption strength following the order: COO<sup>-</sup> > HCONHOH > HCOCH<sub>2</sub>OH > CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> > C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O ≈ HCHO > C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O, indicating that carboxyl groups have the strongest binding ability on the calcite surface. Oleate sodium (OAS), containing carboxyl groups, was then selected as a model compound for the experimental validation. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses confirmed the successful incorporation of the OAS into shale and its chemical bonding with the calcite surface. Mechanical tests demonstrated that the OAS treatment significantly enhanced shale strength, increased the surface contact angle from 21.7 to 94.0°, and markedly increased surface hydrophobicity, effectively mitigating fluid-induced weakening. This study systematically reveals the interfacial chemical interaction mechanism between carboxyl functional groups and calcareous minerals in shale and proposes a chemical consolidation design strategy based on functional group-mineral interactions, providing new theoretical guidance for wellbore stabilization in shale formations.",

This highly selective barrier represents a significant challenge for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the inner ear. To overcome this issue, various drug delivery methods have been developed. Among these modalities, microbubble-assisted ultrasound is an innovative and promising method for the noninvasive, targeted and efficient delivery of therapeutic agents through the round window membrane. The safety and the efficacy of this physical modality is strongly dependent on physiological properties of the targeted tissue, the pharmacological properties of the therapeutic molecules, the ultrasound parameters but also microbubble-related properties.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-vis), powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), TEM, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies are used to characterize the developed NPs. Following initial characterization, biophysical techniques are used to confirm the DNA and protein binding ability of the developed nanoparticles. The results of UV-metric titration and fluorescence spectroscopic titration confirm the binding efficacy of the developed nanoparticles to DNA and protein, respectively. The anticancer activity of AA-AuNPs against HeLa cancer cells is evaluated using the MTT assay, alongside HEK-293 normal cells, demonstrating promising therapeutic potential with minimal toxicity toward normal cells. Concurrently, the developed nanoparticles exhibited effective phenoxazinone mimicking activity. Furthermore, these nanoparticles exhibit a remarkable ability to degrade toxic dyes, achieving over 90% degradation within an 80 min time frame.

    "Abstract": "Enhancing interfacial reliability of fiber-reinforced rubber composites is essential for ensuring overall safety, which was traditionally achieved through resorcinol-formaldehyde-latex (RFL) dipping on fiber frameworks. Nevertheless, the widely used RFL system has come under strict regulation due to its toxicity. Most existing alternatives focus on petroleum-based resins, which lack long-term sustainability. To address this issue, a novel bio-based dipping system was developed as a sustainable and effective substitute for the RFL system. A dopamine-like structure was incorporated to facilitate the formation of the bio-based phenolic resin, and the resin formulation was optimized to yield a robust network and a stable dipping layer. Covulcanization at the fiber-rubber interface ensured robust interfacial bonding. The bio-based dipping system combines the rigidity of phenolic resins with the flexibility of the dopamine-like segments, constructing an interfacial layer with strength comparable to RFL, enhanced toughness, and lower interfacial heat buildup. These contribute to achieving static adhesion comparable to RFL while demonstrating interfacial fatigue resistance up to 49% higher, far exceeding the interfacial fatigue life reported for other fiber-rubber composite systems. Compared to other eco-friendly dipping systems, this work not only upgrades bio-based raw materials but also offers the advantages of a simple one-step process and superior interfacial fatigue resistance, making it a promising solution for both environmental sustainability and high-performance industrial applications.",

    "Abstract": "Phase change material (PCM) leveraging solar energy for photothermal conversion and thermal storage represents a common research strategy. However, its practical application is constrained by low thermal conductivity, suboptimal photothermal performance, and the cumbersome vacuum impregnation process. Herein, we propose a novel functional composite PCM with high shape stability and superior photothermal conversion efficiency, comprising hierarchically porous hollow carbon spheres (HPHCS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG). HPHCS exhibits an exceptionally high specific surface area of 2399 m<sup>2</sup>/g. Its unique hierarchically porous structure enables stable 77 wt % PEG loading under atmospheric-pressure conditions, eliminating the strong dependence on time-consuming vacuum impregnation methods that typically exists for PCM loading in porous carbon matrices. Crucially, the composite PCM with 25 wt % HPHCS demonstrated a 116% enhancement in thermal conductivity compared to pure PEG10000. The unique hollow hierarchical architecture of HPHCS ensured exceptional encapsulation integrity for PEG, with thermal properties and microscopic morphology remaining essentially unchanged after 100 thermal cycles. The composite PCM exhibits excellent broadband light absorption and high photothermal conversion efficiency, demonstrating significant potential for solar water heating applications.",

    "Abstract": "The similar molecular sizes and physicochemical properties of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and hydrocarbons like methane (CH<sub>4</sub>), acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), and ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) make their separation a major industrial challenge. Here, we develop a low-cost, easily regenerable, pure-silica zeolite adsorbent \"Instituto de Tecnología Química-55\" (ITQ-55) capable of exclusively recognizing CO<sub>2</sub> over these hydrocarbons. Guided by three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) and density functional theory calculations, we identified commercially available and cost-effective diquaternary ammonium compounds as alternative organic structure-directing agents (OSDAs), partially replacing the previously expensive and complex ones for the synthesis of pure-silica ITQ-55. The calcined ITQ-55 features narrow 8-ring pores that enable selective CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption while minimizing the uptake of CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. Notably, the uptake ratio of CO<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> is much higher than that of currently reported CO<sub>2</sub>-selective adsorption materials. Dynamic breakthrough tests reveal that ITQ-55 exhibits excellent separation performance for CO<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, and CO<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. In addition, the spent ITQ-55 adsorbent can be easily regenerated at 80 °C. Furthermore, theoretical calculations confirm that the separation mechanism of ITQ-55 for CO<sub>2</sub>/hydrocarbons is a size-exclusion mechanism.",

    "Abstract": "van der Waals heterostructures composed of a few atomic layers have attracted significant attention in the condensed matter physics community. Although interlayer bonding is weak, effects such as moiré modulation, charge redistribution, and electronic hybridization can substantially modify the band structure and interlayer coupling. In this work, we investigate heterostructures composed of few-layer PtSe<sub>2</sub> and PtTe<sub>2</sub> by using first-principles calculations implemented within density functional theory (DFT) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). While both materials are Dirac semimetals in the bulk form, they undergo a transition to semiconducting states in the few-layer limit. These heterostructures allow systematic examination of how dimensional confinement and interfacial interactions influence band structure and interlayer coupling. Our combined ARPES measurements and DFT calculations indicate the presence of electronic hybridization at the interface. The interlayer coupling in PtSe<sub>2</sub>/PtTe<sub>2</sub> is associated with flat-band features and valence-band splitting induced by both inversion symmetry breaking and spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, the local density of states indicates metallic behavior at the MM site while it remains semiconducting at MX and XX sites with the band gap of 0.40 and 0.25 eV, respectively. Further analysis shows that the electronic hybridization and charge transfer between PtSe<sub>2</sub> and PtTe<sub>2</sub> are sensitive to the interlayer distance, which is consistent with moiré characteristics. These results highlight how interfacial interactions govern the electronic properties of vdW heterostructures.",

Through multidimensional input control, including polarization and gate voltage, the phototransistor successfully simulates synaptic behaviors analogous to human neural responses to visual stimuli, with paired-pulse facilitation values reaching 201%. Critically, the device demonstrates gate-tunable short-term plasticity, with optical persistence triggering stable long-term plasticity states that underpin memory consolidation. The neuromorphic properties enable the development of a hybrid optical-electronic neural network which achieves a classification accuracy of over 90% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset and a reconstruction accuracy of 71.38% using data from the Yale Face Database under 0º linear polarization. We demonstrate a polarization-resolved imaging approach utilizing the black arsenic-phosphorus phototransistor to reconstruct hidden targets with high fidelity through Stokes parameter extraction and degree of linear polarization mapping, revealing intricate polarization features invisible to conventional imaging systems.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Micro-nano lasers hold significant promise for on-chip integrated photonics, where perovskite materials emerge as compelling gain media despite stability challenges. While moisture typically degrades perovskite structures, its controlled integration can paradoxically enhance crystallization. Here, we demonstrate a synergistic strategy utilizing water molecules and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) additive to achieve high-quality methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI₃) films with low defect density. Through optimized BHT (4 wt%) combined with 95% relative humidity treatment, we attain an unprecedented amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold of 8.987 μJ cm⁻² under nanosecond pulse excitation – the lowest value reported to date. This dual-triggered film completes ASE intensity retention after 30-day ambient storage. In situ structural and optoelectronic characterization reveals that BHT extends water-perovskite interaction, facilitating organic cation vertical diffusion and preferential (110)-oriented crystallization with 53.02% perpendicular alignment. Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy confirms suppressed non-radiative recombination, evidenced by 11% prolonged carrier lifetime (6145 ps), while temperature-dependent photoluminescence reveals enhanced exciton binding energy (73.50 meV vs. 60.68 meV) conducive to low-threshold lasing.

    "Abstract": "The reliability of through-glass via (TGV) interconnects is critical for advanced semiconductor packaging. This work investigates microstructural and mechanical evolution in electroplated TGV-Cu subjected to long-term aging at 250 °C. TGV samples were fabricated via laser-induced etching and double-sided copper electroplating, then aged for up to 1008 h. Nanoindentation revealed region-dependent reductions in hardness (from 2.0-2.5 GPa to below 0.5 GPa) and modulus (from 110-130 GPa to 40-90 GPa), with surface-near regions most affected. The glass substrate maintained stable mechanical properties until microcracks formed after 1008 h. EBSD quantification showed grain-size enlargement from 0.46 µm to 1.86 µm and a concurrent decrease in dislocation density. Molecular dynamics simulations of 3, 4, 5 nm grains corroborated the inverse relationship between grain size and micro-mechanical properties. A hybrid Potts-phase field model further linked grain coarsening to stress relaxation and elastic-energy minimization, revealing that as grains grow, the overall von Mises stress in the structure decreases; high-modulus grains retain relatively higher local stresses, while low-modulus, low-stress grains exhibit faster growth rates. Electrical I-V measurements confirmed stable ohmic behavior, despite a drop in insulation resistance. These integrated experimental and computational insights provide theoretical guidance for optimizing TGV interposer design and ensuring long-term operational reliability in heterogeneous integration technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The intricate relationship between the microbiota and cancer has recently emerged as a pivotal area of research, highlighting their critical roles in carcinogenesis, progression, and prognosis. With the increasing recognition of the therapeutic potential of the microbiota in cancer, there is an urgent need to understand the diverse impacts of different microbiota on tumors and explore innovative strategies to harness their benefits. For the first time, this review traces the historical evolution of microbiota–cancer studies, from early observations of microbial presence in cancers to landmark discoveries linking specific microorganisms to carcinogenesis. Furthermore, this study delves into the molecular mechanisms underlying microbiota-mediated cancer progression to elucidate the modulatory roles of oncogenic pathways, immune responses, and tumor metabolism. We also discuss the dual roles of the microbiota in promoting and inhibiting cancer, highlighting its potential as both a facilitator of tumor growth and a target for therapeutic intervention. In addition, this review highlights the mechanism by which the microbiota mediates the response to anticancer immunotherapy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Simultaneously, emerging anticancer strategies targeting microbiota (e.g., probiotics, antibiotics, and fecal microbiota transplantation) have been explored alongside U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs and ongoing clinical trials. Finally, this review outlines future directions in this field, emphasizing the need for personalized approaches to harness the anticancer potential of the microbiota. The interpretations in this review are expected to establish a stereoscopic, comprehensive framework for advancing research and clinical applications in microbiota-targeted oncology.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Radiotherapy remains a mainstay of cancer treatment. However, radiotherapy can also elicit acute and chronic adverse effects, including dermal inflammation and skin fibrosis. A comprehensive understanding of the underlying fibrotic processes remains elusive, and currently, no established treatment options exist. Canonical Wnt signaling has emerged as a significant player in fibrotic conditions. The Dickkopf (DKK) protein family comprises key modulators of Wnt signaling. To define the function of DKK3 in radiation-induced skin damage, we combined complementary in vivo and in vitro approaches, including a 3D human skin model, mice with cell-type-specific Dkk3 deletions, and irradiated human skin specimens. Our study revealed the pivotal role of DKK3 in regulating the response of the skin to radiation, with diminished DKK3 significantly mitigating radiation-induced skin damage. We found that radiation increases DKK3 expression in basal keratinocytes, leading to elevated ROS levels, TGF-β-mediated Wnt activation, epidermal hyperplasia, and subsequent skin fibrosis. Increased keratinocyte expression of DKK3 also drives macrophage polarization toward a CD163 high CD206 high profibrotic M2 phenotype, activating myofibroblasts and leading to fibrosis. Notably, DKK3 deficiency in keratinocytes markedly reduces radiation-induced dermal hyperplasia and fibrosis, identifying DKK3 as a key regulator of cutaneous radiation responses. These findings position DKK3 as a promising upstream modulator of TGF-β signaling for mitigating radiation-induced dermatitis and fibrosis, with potential relevance to other fibrotic diseases.",

The ATTENTION study (phase II, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial (Registration number: ChiCTR2100047453), evaluated the efficacy and safety of aumolertinib plus apatinib vs. aumolertinib alone in untreated, EGFR -mutant, advanced NSCLC. The primary endpoint was the 18-month PFS rate. Across 18 centers in China, 104 patients were enrolled to receive aumolertinib alone (n = 51) or with apatinib (n = 53). At a median follow-up duration of 19.4 months, aumolertinib plus apatinib outperformed aumolertinib alone in terms of the 18-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate (74% vs. 50%, P = 0.036), median PFS (not reached [NR] vs. 20.1 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.41, P = 0.017), and objective response rate (79% vs. 59%, P = 0.024). No grade 4/5 treatment-related adverse effects (TRAEs) were observed, whereas grade 3 TRAEs occurred in 38% vs. 27% of patients, with hypertension (11%) and platelet count decrease (9%) being most common in the combination arm. Exploratory analysis revealed that PFS benefits from aumolertinib plus apatinib predominantly in those with TP53 mutations. As an infusion-free option, aumolertinib plus apatinib demonstrated PFS benefits with manageable safety in patients with untreated, EGFR -mutant, advanced NSCLC.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Study design Prospective mixed methods implementation study. Objectives To: (1) implement a SCI-specific care pathway for body composition assessment (ATSCI-Nut); (2) pilot test the feasibility (reach, adoption, adherence, appropriateness, and acceptability) of the care pathway in patients with new traumatic SCI; (3) explore patient experiences with the care pathway and the effect of providing body composition information on dietary choices and (4) explore clinician experiences with the new care pathway. Setting Victorian Spinal Cord Service, Australia Methods Participants included individuals with acute SCI who received the ATSCI-Nut pathway and consented to data collection. Feasibility outcomes (reach, adoption and intervention fidelity) were collected from medical records. Acceptability and appropriateness were explored via patient semi-structured interviews and clinician focus groups. Results Twenty-three patients were eligible, 21 (91%) consented. Adherence to the ATSCI-Nut pathway initial assessment and review components during weeks 2–8 and &gt;8 weeks was 86, 71 and 69%, respectively. Adherence to completing bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) measurements at specified time-points was 69%. However, only 43% of participants had all BIS measurements completed at specified time-points. Two themes were common to patients and clinicians: physiological and body composition changes directing focus of rehabilitation, and barriers and enablers to optimal care. One additional theme arose from patient interviews: impact of SCI on self-image and lifestyle. Conclusions The ATSCI-Nut pathway is a feasible and acceptable model to deliver body composition assessment despite mixed adherence to the pathway overall. However, barriers to optimal patient care and pathway adaptations need to be explored to improve adherence.",

In this study, we investigated the impact of PPT1 deficiency on hippocampal GABAergic interneurons (INs) and associated neural network oscillations in a PPT1-KI ( CLN1 c.451 C &gt; T (p.R151X)) mouse model. Using a combination of in vivo electrophysiology, immunostaining, and fiber photometry, we observed that PPT1 deficiency led to the activation of caspase 3 in parvalbumin-positive (PV + ) INs, an increased activity of pyramidal neurons and theta/gamma oscillation power, and the disruption of theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in the early stage of the CLN1 disease model. In the late stage of the CLN1 disease model, we observed the reduced neuronal activity, extensive neuronal loss including PV + INs, and the emergence of spontaneous epileptiform discharges and the pathological ripples. Treatment with diazepam partially restored oscillatory coupling and reduced seizure-like activities. Our research indicated that PPT1 deficiency leads to early selective impairment of PV + INs, triggering overactivation of pyramidal neurons and network dysfunction, which consequently results in seizures and neurodegeneration. This research provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of CLN1 disease and potential therapeutic strategies for the intervention of CLN1 disease by improving the function of inhibitory INs via caspase inhibition.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Drug-induced tongue discoloration can impact quality of life but remain under-recognized. While several antimicrobials are implicated, comprehensive signals across many drug classes remain poorly characterized. Methods Reports of tongue discoloration, strawberry tongue, and black hairy tongue were extracted from the USFDA Adverse Event Reporting System from 2004 to 2024. Disproportionality analysis was conducted using reporting odds ratio, proportional reporting ratio, Bayesian confidence propagation neural network, and multi-item gamma Poisson shrinker to detect associations between implicated drugs and tongue conditions. Results A total of 2352 reports were analyzed. Drugs consistently associated with tongue discoloration by both frequentist and Bayesian analyses included clarithromycin, metronidazole, linezolid, amoxicillin, and fluticasone. Flucloxacillin and immunoglobulin G emerged as risks for strawberry tongue. Meclizine showed a signal for black hairy tongue across methods, whereas other drugs appeared risk factors using only frequentist tests. Demographic patterns varied by condition. Conclusion This comprehensive signal detection revealed several high-priority drug-tongue condition associations using large-scale pharmacovigilance data. Findings carry implications for guiding clinical practice through enhancing adverse effect monitoring for high-risk medications. Priority signals merit validation through further research to optimize benefit-risk assessment and reduce preventable tongue disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Enolase 1 (ENO1) is a glycolytic enzyme involved in tumor progression that performs a variety of classical and nonclassical functions. However, the mechanism by which it promotes tumor progression is still not fully understood. Here, we revealed that TGFβ1/Smad3 signaling triggered the symmetric dimethylation of arginine (SDMA) on ENO1 by protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5), leading to membranous ENO1 translocation. Surface ENO1 interacts with monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) for lactate secretion, which recruits M2 macrophages and promotes an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Targeting surface ENO1 with HuL001, a first-in-class humanized antibody, significantly reduced glycolysis, decreased extracellular lactate accumulation, reprogrammed macrophage polarization and inhibited tumor growth and distant metastasis. Moreover, targeting surface ENO1 significantly increased the therapeutic response to radiotherapy and delayed tumor regrowth by increasing antitumoral M1 macrophages and cytotoxic CD8 + T cells infiltration within TME. These results indicated that targeting surface ENO1 remodeled the tumor microenvironment and provided better therapeutic effects to radiotherapy in poorly immunogenic colorectal cancer (CRC) and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).",

    "Abstract": "Accurately predicting disease progression remains a major challenge in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here we show that a biomarker-integrated prognostic staging system can stratify progression risk across the disease course by jointly incorporating cognitive status, established risk factors, plasma biomarkers, and neuroimaging measures. In the K-ROAD cohort (N = 1,263), the dominant prognostic contributors varied by clinical context-GFAP in cognitively unimpaired individuals, hippocampal volume in mild cognitive impairment, and age in dementia-while plasma phosphorylated tau-217 provided consistent secondary prognostic information across stages. Outcome-specific staging captured clinically meaningful gradients of progression risk and informed construction of a unified six-stage framework (Stage 0-IVB) with distinct inflection points of accelerated decline. External validation in the ADNI cohort (N = 290) demonstrated consistent patterns of worsening prognosis, particularly in early and intermediate stages. This system provides a clinically interpretable approach to risk stratification and may serve as an exploratory framework for biomarker-integrated prognostic stratification in AD.",

    "Abstract": "The reverse water-gas shift reaction (RWGSR) is essential for converting CO<sub>2</sub> into fuels using renewable hydrogen, but it remains challenged by the difficulty of simultaneously maximizing catalyst activity, selectivity, and stability. These limitations stem from thermodynamic constraints - specifically, the Gibbs-Curie-Wulff theorem - which restricts the synthetic accessibility of high-energy micro-faceted nanocrystals via conventional methods. To address this, we introduce a near-surface \"quasi-hyperbaric\" ammonia strategy that integrates atmospheric-pressure processing with in-situ ammonia decomposition. This approach enables the controlled synthesis of molybdenum nitride nanocrystals with preferentially exposed high-energy (112) microfacets. These facets promote CO<sub>2</sub> activation through a hydrogen-assisted redox mechanism, driven by geometrically confined and stabilized Mo-N/M-O hybrid active sites. The resulting catalyst outperforms the benchmark Pt/CeO₂, which typically suffers from CO selectivity below 92%. Our catalyst achieves near-equilibrium conversion (56%) at a space velocity (24000 ml/g<sub>cat</sub>/h), with 100% CO selectivity and outstanding stability (≤ 1% deactivation over 250 hours).",

    "Abstract": "The APOE-ε4/ε4 genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease, though the relative risk is diminished in individuals with African ancestry. Through analysis of phased APOE alleles, we identify a 19 bp deletion approximately 1.1 kb distal to the APOE 3'UTR in a SPI1 microglial transcription factor binding site. The deletion is present in 60% of African American APOE-ε4 homozygotes and reduces Alzheimer's disease odds ratio relative to individuals without the deletion. The deletion also delays Alzheimer's disease onset in APOE-ε4/ε4 cases with local African ancestry at APOE. The All of Us dataset confirms reduced Alzheimer´s disease risk associated with the deletion and identifies additional variants between APOE and APOC1 that disentangle APOE-ε4 neurological and lipid-related phenotypes. Functional assays reveal that the 19 bp deletion abolishes SPI1 repression at this region. Collectively, these findings describe a protective allele at APOE in African Americans that mediates APOC1 expression, reducing relative Alzheimer´s disease risk.",

    "Abstract": "Electrical control of magnetism is critical for advancing both fundamental understanding and technological applications of magnetic systems. Although gate-voltage-induced carrier modulation enables tuning of magnetic properties, current-induced mechanisms offer more dynamic and versatile control. To date, such control has been investigated exclusively through spin exchange interactions between itinerant and localized electrons, leaving the role of orbital exchange interactions entirely unexplored. Here, we establish a theoretical framework for current-induced control of magnetism mediated by orbital exchange interactions, incorporating the full orbital degrees of freedom, including orbital angular momentum and orbital angular position. We show that nonequilibrium orbital densities generated by the orbital Hall and orbital Edelstein effects induce not only damping-like and field-like torques, but also current-driven modifications of the magnetic anisotropy, damping, and gyromagnetic ratio. Our estimates suggest that orbital-exchange-mediated effects can exceed their spin-exchange counterparts, positioning orbital exchange as a dominant mechanism for magnetism control. We further propose experimental schemes based on harmonic Hall and spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements to quantify these effects. These findings uncover a previously unrecognized route for electrical control of magnetism and extend current-induced effects to a broader class of materials beyond conventional dipolar magnets.",

We construct peptide-based coacervate droplets using microfluidics and find that charged polymers within the coacervates help create uneven H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>-</sup> distributions, resulting in pH-regionalized microenvironments similar to the nucleolus. More interestingly, such a pH difference weakens or even disappears following the destruction of LLPS, a phenomenon observed in both nucleolus and coacervate droplets. Based on these findings, we demonstrate the ability to finely tune the local pH of the coacervate droplets over a wide range by incorporating enzymes, which can drive and control cascade reactions, and perform basic molecular biology operations such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in vitro transcription and translation reaction (IVTT). This study highlights the role of LLPS in pH modulation within MLOs and provides insights into the potential of coacervates as protocells for broader applications.",

    "Abstract": "Directional thermal management is critical for energy harvesting and utilization. The common passive radiative cooling and heating strategies free of electricity input mainly focus on regulating the solar and thermal radiation properties of materials while neglecting the thermal conduction process. The directional thermal management for harvesting thermal energy based on the rare thermal rectifying materials is usually in the absence of radiation regulation. Here, the dual Janus foams with dual asymmetries in photothermal and thermal rectification are designed and exhibit high photothermal property contrast and excellent thermal rectification ratios (122 %). The temperature difference ratio of the managed end could be improved nearly 21 times from 3 % based on a single Janus structure to 65 % based on a dual Janus structure. This method provides a comprehensive and inspiring view for better directional thermal management in the future.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Rate performance of several applications, such as batteries, fuel cells, and electrochemical sensors, is exponentially dependent on the ionic migration barrier ( E m ) within solids, a difficult-to-estimate quantity. Previous approaches to identify materials with low E m have often relied on imprecise descriptors or rules-of-thumb. Here, we present a graph-neural-network-based architecture that leverages principles of transfer learning to efficiently and accurately predict E m across a variety of materials. We use a model (labeled MPT) that has been simultaneously pre-trained on seven bulk properties, introduce architectural modifications to build inductive bias on different migration pathways in a structure, and subsequently fine-tune (FT) on a manually-curated, literature-derived, first-principles computational dataset of 619 E m values. Importantly, our best-performing FT model (labeled MODEL-3, based on test set scores) demonstrates substantially better accuracy compared to classical machine learning methods, graph models trained from scratch, and a universal machine learned interatomic potential, with a R 2 score and a mean absolute error of 0.703 ± 0.109 and 0.261 ± 0.034 eV, respectively, on the test set and is able to classify ‘good’ ionic conductors with an 80% accuracy. Thus, our work demonstrates the effective use of FT strategies and MPT architectural modifications to predict E m , and can be extended to make predictions on other data-scarce material properties.",

    "Abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in the aged population with the late stage geographic atrophy (GA). Risk factors for AMD include age, genetic variants in the complement system, nutritional factors, and alterations in the gut microbiome (GM). To identify taxonomic and functional differences in the microbiome associated to disease pathophysiology and genetic risk factors, this study investigated the GM and the ocular surface microbiome (OSM) of GA patients compared to healthy controls by whole-metagenome shotgun sequencing. 16 AMD-associated SNPs were genotyped from blood samples using TaqMan assays and Sanger sequencing. While GA patients showed differences in the GM, and altered metabolic pathways including inosine 5'-phosphate degradation, NAD salvage, and ketogenesis, no alterations in the OSM were found. Genetic analysis associated SNP rs1061170 in the complement factor H gene with GA. These findings suggest that microbial alterations may contribute to GA through inflammation and oxidative stress.Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02438111, Registration date: 28 April 2015, and NCT04658238, Registration date: 01 December 2020.",

    "Abstract": "Mengding Bud Yellow Tea (MDBYT) is distinguished by its characteristic sweet and umami aroma. This study integrated quantitative descriptive analysis, HS-SPME-GC-MS, and UPLC-QQQ-MS to systematically elucidate, for the first time, the dynamic evolution of MDBYT aroma and its formation mechanisms. Sensory evaluation revealed that, among the 13 aroma descriptors, sweetness, umami, and mellowness were the primary attributes positively correlated with overall aroma quality. The yellowing process was the pivotal stage driving the aroma transition from grassy to sweet and umami notes. A total of 38 differential metabolites were identified, of which β-ionone, linalool, n-pentanal, n-heptanal, n-octanal, and 1-octen-3-ol, emerged as key contributors. These metabolites were primarily involved in modulating the sweetness, umami, and mellowness attributes of MDBYT. Quantitative profiling of 10 classes of GBVs demonstrated significant accumulation of linalyl and geranyl glycosides during the fixing and yellowing stages, providing strong evidence that glycoside hydrolysis constitutes a major release pathway for aroma-active compounds. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the unique aroma of MDBYT is established through a coordinated, processing-driven biochemical network involving carotenoid degradation, glycoside hydrolysis, and lipid oxidation. This study provides a robust scientific foundation for the targeted regulation of flavor quality and the optimization of yellow tea processing strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) comprises an array of subdomains, each defined by a characteristic structure and function. Although altered ER processes are linked to age-onset pathogenesis, it is unclear whether shifts in ER structure or dynamics underlie these functional changes. Here we establish ER structural and functional remodelling as a conserved feature of ageing across yeast, C aenorhabditis elegans and mammals. Focusing on C. elegans as the exemplar of metazoan ageing, we reveal striking age-related reductions in ER volume across diverse tissues and a morphological shift from rough sheets to tubular ER. This morphological transition corresponds with large-scale shifts in ER proteome composition from protein synthesis to lipid metabolism, a phenomenon conserved in mammalian tissues. We show that Atg8 and ULK1-dependent ER-phagy drives age-associated ER remodelling through tissue-specific factors, including the previously uncharacterized ER-phagy regulator TMEM-131 and the IRE-1–XBP-1 branch of the unfolded protein response. Providing support for a model where ER remodelling is adaptive, diverse lifespan-extending paradigms downscale and remodel ER morphology throughout life. Furthermore, mTOR-dependent lifespan extension in yeast and worms requires ER-phagy, indicating that ER remodelling is a proactive and protective response during ageing. These results reveal ER-phagy and ER dynamics as pronounced, underappreciated mechanisms of both normal ageing and age-delaying interventions.",

Microscopic examination remains the standard method for detecting and quantifying intracellular parasite burden in leishmaniases research and Drug Discovery. This process is time-consuming and requires specific expertise. While Artificial Intelligence shows promise in automating this task, progress is limited by the lack of annotated datasets. To address this gap, we present AIR-LEISH, a dataset of 180 Giemsa-stained microscopic images with expert annotations containing 8,140 Leishmania amastigotes and 1511 macrophages. Images corresponded to samples from two infection models. The dataset was annotated to facilitate AI-based object detection and image segmentation tasks. We further demonstrated the potential of this dataset through training and testing two state-of-the-art architectures, namely YOLOv8 and U-Net. Both models demonstrated promising performance for automatic classification, detection and counting of amastigotes. The dataset is freely available on the Zenodo platform to accelerate the development of AI-based tools, facilitate advances in leishmaniases research and support collaborative initiatives for public health.",

Although the metabolic responses of adipose tissue to cold are well documented, the dynamic transcriptional and proteomic changes that occur in both inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) and classic brown adipose tissue (BAT) in response to cold exposure remain poorly understood. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying cold-induced thermogenesis and adipose tissue remodeling, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to examine the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, respectively, of adipose tissue from mice exposed to cold or room temperature. The male C57BL/6 J mice were divided into three groups (5 mice/group), two groups were kept at 6 °C for 6 h and 24 h, respectively, and the control group was kept at 22 °C. Subsequently, the BAT and iWAT of each mouse were dissected and subjected to RNA-seq and data-independent acquisition (DIA)-based LC-MS/MS.

Mangosteen peel is rich in bioactive compounds such as xanthones and flavonoids, which exhibit potent antifungal properties. The microemulsion is prepared using a phase inversion composition (PIC) method, incorporating virgin coconut oil (VCO) as the oil phase and Tween 80 as the surfactant, resulting in a stable and homogenous oil-in-water system. The optimized formulation consisted of 0.20% (w/w) mangosteen peel crude extract, 4.80% VCO, 5.00% Tween 80, 1% α-tocopherol, and distilled water to complete 100% (w/w) of the composition. The formulation exhibited significant antifungal activity both in vitro and in vivo against Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium proliferatum, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, pathogens responsible for fruit rot in crops such as banana, tomato, and mango. The microemulsion, ME80% effectively inhibited fungal growth, spore germination, and significantly reduced disease severity in treated fruits. The enhanced antifungal efficacy is attributed to the synergistic action of phytochemicals present in the extract, highlighting the potential of this formulation as a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative for fruit rot disease management.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Quantum phase classification is a fundamental problem in quantum many-body physics, traditionally approached using order parameters or quantum machine learning techniques such as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs). However, these methods often require extensive prior knowledge of the system or large numbers of quantum state copies for reliable classification. In this work, we propose a classification algorithm based on the quantum Neyman–Pearson test, which is theoretically optimal for distinguishing between two quantum states. While directly constructing the quantum Neyman–Pearson test for many-body systems via full state tomography is intractable due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, we introduce a partitioning strategy that applies hypothesis tests to subsystems rather than the entire state, effectively reducing the required number of quantum state copies while maintaining classification accuracy. We validate our approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating its advantages over conventional methods, including the order parameter-based classifier, the QCNN, and the recently developed classical machine learning algorithm enhanced with quantum data. Our results show that the proposed method achieves lower classification error probabilities with fewer required quantum state copies compared to all of these baselines, while also reducing the training cost relative to the QCNN and the classical machine learning algorithm enhanced with quantum data, and further decreasing the classical computational time in comparison with the latter. We additionally demonstrate scalability of our method in numerical experiments up to systems with 81 qubits. These findings highlight the potential of quantum hypothesis testing as a powerful tool for quantum phase classification, particularly in experimental settings where quantum measurements are combined with classical post-processing.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates heat transfer coefficients during two-phase flow boiling of distilled water within a horizontal, rectangular mini-channel with asymmetric heating. The microchannel dimensions are 180 mm × 4 mm × 1.5 mm. Experimental observations of flow structures were made through a transparent channel wall. Experiments were conducted under low Reynolds number conditions (281 ≤ Re ≤ 499), with measurements of inlet pressure, pressure drop, volumetric flow rate, heater power supply parameters, and temperatures at various points. The employed model assumed negligible influence of material properties on temperature and time-independent heat transfer. The flow resistance based on the two-phase separated flow Lockhart-Martinelli model was used to determine the water velocity profile in the mini-channel. The velocity profile satisfied the Poisson equation. The copper block and working fluid temperature distributions were assumed to adhere to appropriate energy equations with suitable boundary conditions. The Trefftz method was applied to solve these equations, providing the water velocity profile and 2D temperature distributions. Based on the calculated temperature distributions, the Nusselt number at the heating surface-water interface was determined. The experimental results were subsequently compared with theoretical correlations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The biological activity of silver-based antimicrobial agents is strongly influenced by the source and generation method of silver ions (Ag⁺); however, a direct comparison of their efficacy from different sources has not been previously reported. In this study, we systematically compared the antibacterial and anti-virulence effects of Ag⁺ derived from three sources: direct current (DC) electrolysis, silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs), and silver nitrate (AgNO₃), standardized to 400 ppm. Electrolyzed Ag⁺ exhibited the strongest antibacterial effect, reducing viable counts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus by 91.06% and 71.10%, respectively. It also caused substantial membrane disruption, reduced motility, and increased cellular leakage, as confirmed by SEM imaging, DNA and K⁺ ion leakage, and extracellular protein release. Furthermore, electrolyzed Ag⁺ most effectively suppressed key virulence factors, including biofilm formation, pigment production (pyocyanin, staphyloxanthin), and the activities of protease, esterase, and hemolysin. Despite identical Ag⁺ concentrations, the biological activity varied significantly with ion source, underscoring the importance of the delivery mechanism. These findings highlight the superior efficacy of electrolyzed Ag⁺ and support its potential application in clinical, environmental, and industrial antimicrobial strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Recently, nicorandil exerted antinociception via TRPV1/opioid signaling. Herein, the entanglement of downstream signals and NO-cGMP-K ATP pathway of nicorandil mediated antinociception was investigated against neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction injury of sciatic nerve (CCI) and formalin evoked inflammatory pain. Nicorandil (150 mg/kg, twice, 2 h apart, PO) reversed mechanical and cold allodynia induced by CCI, reduced the licking time and number of flinches in formalin test. L-arginine (500 mg/kg, I.P), N(ω)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 mg/kg, I.P), methylene blue (10 mg/kg, I.P), sildenafil (2.5 mg/kg, I.P) and glibenclamide (5 mg/kg, I.P) were tested 30 min before nicorandil. The inhibitory effect of nicorandil on mechanical and cold allodynia was partially attenuated by L-arginine, methylene blue and sildenafil. L-NAME but not glibenclamide, potentiated the antinociceptive action of nicorandil on cold allodynia. In formalin test, nicorandil reduced flinches; an effect that was partially reversed by L-arginine and sildenafil but not by L-NAME, methylene blue or glibenclamide. Nicorandil reduced serum levels of the oxidative marker (MDA) and the inflammatory mediators (TNF-α, IL-6 and COX-2). Immunohistochemical studies revealed that nicorandil blunted the elevation of MAPK ERK1/2 protein expressions in DRG whereas naloxone reversed that suppression. L-arginine and sildenafil reversed nicorandil mediated improvements of histopathological milieu of sciatic nerves and DRG. Taken together, these data demonstrate that nicorandil has an antiallodynic effect on neuropathic and inflammatory pain via inhibition of NO/cGMP pathways and reduction of oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines targeting ROS/TNF-α, IL6 /MAPK ERK1/2 signaling pathways. These findings highlight nicorandil’s potential as a promising multitarget therapeutic option for pain management through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study evaluated and compared the effectiveness of Bacillus species probiotics and formalin-killed bacterin to control vibriosis caused by Vibrio anguillarium in European eel ( Anguilla anguilla ) elvers. Fish were allocated into four triplicate groups defined as follows: a control non-vaccinated (CON) group that fed on a basal diet without additives, two groups fed on diets supplied with Bacillus species probiotics (PRO; Sanolife PRO-F) in a dose of 0.5 g /kg diet (PRO-F1) and 1.0 g /kg diet (PRO-F2), and the fourth group was vaccinated with immersion formalin-killed bacterin and got a booster vaccination at 14th day (VACC). The experiment lasted for 28 days. In the end, the immune responses, including antibody titers, lysozyme activities (in serum and skin mucous), and bactericidal activity, were evaluated. The relative percent survival (RPS) after intraperitoneal challenge with V. anguillarium was calculated after an additional 10-day observation period. A one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison test was used to compare the experimental groups (VACC, PRO-F1, and PRO-F2) with the CON group. The results revealed significantly higher antibody titers, lysozyme activities (in serum and skin mucous), and serum bactericidal activity in the VACC and PRO-treated groups over the CON group. Of interest, the lysozyme activities (in serum and skin mucous) and antibody titers were significantly higher in the VACC group over both PRO groups. After the experimental infection, it was noticed that both VACC and PRO significantly protected eel elvers against V. anguillarium compared to the CON group. In addition, the RPS were 41.67%, 29.17%, and 37.50% in the VACC, PRO-F1, and PRO-F2 groups, respectively. This study unveils the vital roles of PRO and VACC and their effective roles in enhancing innate and mucosal immunities and protecting European eel elvers against vibriosis caused by V. anguillarium . Based on our findings, immersion vaccination emerges as the superior strategy for managing vibriosis in eels. This approach offers greater protection than feed-based probiotics, underscoring its potential as a viable vaccination method in eel aquaculture.",

    "Abstract": "Automatic Modulation Classification (AMC) plays a critical role in the design of intelligent receivers for next-generation wireless systems, particularly in the context of 5G and beyond networks characterized by diverse multicarrier waveform technologies. This paper proposes a novel AMC framework based on a Deep Residual Network (DRN) architecture enhanced with multilevel Residual-of-Residual (RoR) connections, specifically designed to classify advanced modulation formats across a wide spectrum of 5G candidate waveforms, namely Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), Filtered-OFDM (FOFDM), Filter Bank Multi-Carrier (FBMC), Universal Filtered Multi-Carrier (UFMC), and Weighted Overlap-and-Add OFDM (WOLA), modulated using both 16-QAM and 64-QAM schemes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work applying DRN enhanced with multilevel RoR (DRN+RoR) specifically to OFDM, FOFDM, FBMC, UFMC, and WOLA with 16/64-QAM. The proposed architecture exploits the deep hierarchical learning capabilities of DRN+RoR to extract highly discriminative features, while employing Sequential Floating Forward Selection (SFFS) for feature optimization and dimensionality reduction. Extensive simulations are conducted under realistic wireless channel conditions, including time- and frequency-selective fading. Evaluation metrics such as classification accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art machine learning baselines. In particular, our approach achieves higher robustness and classification accuracy across all tested SNRs and waveform types, outperforming recent deep learning-based baselines. We also assess the performance of the proposed algorithm under diverse 5G channel conditions, specifically TDL-A, TDL-B, and TDL-C models. The evaluation results indicate that our proposal maintains robust classification accuracy and strong generalization across all tested channel scenarios. These findings underscore the effectiveness of DRN+RoR as a robust and scalable solution for modulation recognition, offering substantial improvements in adaptive signal processing and enabling more reliable AMC in dynamically evolving 5G and beyond communication environments.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a novel framework for designing a super-twisting algorithm-based fuzzy sliding mode controller to address critical challenges in descriptor T-S fuzzy systems. First, an innovative integral-type sliding surface is proposed, eliminating the longstanding requirement for prior knowledge concerning the derivatives of membership functions (MFs)-a key limitation in existing methods. This approach constitutes a significant advance, ensuring asymptotic stability of the sliding motion without restrictive assumptions on MF dynamics. Subsequently, a multivariable super-twisting algorithm is developed specifically for descriptor T-S systems. This development fundamentally ensures continuity of the closed-loop states and suppresses chattering by design. Finally, two examples are numerically simulated to test the validity of the method proposed.",

    "Abstract": "Primary pullthrough for Hirschsprung disease is the current standard in most uncomplicated standard segment disease. In this review and meta-analysis, we aimed to compare perioperative outcomes and functional outcomes for pullthrough done in the neonatal period compared to that in older age. PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science were searched for relevant publications in English from inception to June 29, 2024. Twenty studies were included in the qualitative analysis with a total 3197 patients matching the review criteria. All included studies were observational in nature, with 1 prospective cohort study, 13 retrospective cohort studies, and 6 case series. Findings suggested primary pullthrough beyond 1 month of age was superior in most outcomes, including: shorter post-operative length of stay (LOS) (MD3.11 days [95% CI 1.34, 4.87]), perioperative sepsis (OR1.76, [95% CI1.26, 2.47]), anastomotic leak (OR2.68 [95% CI0.81, 8.90]), perianal excoriation up to 3 months (OR5.52 [95% CI 3.07, 9.9]), post-operative HAEC at 3 months (OR5.49 [95% CI 3.35, 9]), and anal stenosis (OR3.04 [95% CI 1.07, 8.67]). Pullthrough performed during the neonatal period was associated with a shorter operative time (MD-26.41 min [95% CI - 41.57, 11.26]). There was no significant difference in overall SSI, 30-day readmissions, and pre-operative HAEC. Functional outcomes were assessed in 8 studies showing some tendency towards constipation and incontinence in the older children, and more observed stool frequency and for longer duration post-operatively in the neonates. Older children with Hirschsprung tend to have a better post-operative course and less morbidity compared to neonates. Performing the pullthrough after 1 month is safe and likely to offer the best post-operative outcomes. This review was limited by the low level of evidence and inconsistent definitions of outcomes. Results will need to be verified with a large prospective study.",

    "Abstract": "We measured the complete set of thermoelectric parameters using the time-domain impedance spectroscopy (TDIS) method with controlled heat leakage on a bismuth-telluride-based Π-shaped thermoelectric module over the temperature range of 100-300 K. The resistivity and dimensionless figure of merit (zT) were determined to be 2.341 µΩ m and 0.111 ± 0.001 at 100 K, and 10.194 µΩ m and 0.8645 ± 0.0003 at 300 K, respectively. The corresponding thermal conductivities were 2.443 ± 0.396 W/m K at 100 K and 1.259 ± 0.003 W/m K at 300 K. Based on the definition of zT, the absolute values of the Seebeck coefficient were calculated as 79.74 ± 8.72 µV/K at 100 K and 192.32 ± 0.93 µV/K at 300 K as effective values. These results confirm that the TDIS method enables complete thermoelectric characterization using electrometric measurements. We further analyzed the conditions required to achieve high measurement accuracy within specified error margins. Our findings indicate that the critical factors are the relative error in zT during measurements and the thermal conductance ratio between the thermoelectric element and the lead wires responsible for heat leakage.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The presence of noisy, redundant, and irrelevant features in high-dimensional datasets significantly degrades the performance of classification models. Feature selection is a critical pre-processing step to mitigate this issue by identifying an optimal feature subset. While the Generalized Normal Distribution Optimization (GNDO) algorithm has shown promise in various domains, its efficacy for feature selection is hampered by premature convergence and an imbalance between exploration and exploitation. This paper proposes a Binary Adaptive GNDO (BAGNDO) framework to overcome these limitations. BAGNDO integrates three key strategies: an Adaptive Cauchy Reverse Learning (ACRL) mechanism to enhance population diversity, an Elite Pool Strategy to balance the search process, and a Gaussian Distribution-based Worst-solution Repair (GDWR) method to improve exploitation. The performance of BAGNDO was rigorously evaluated against nine state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms on 18 UCI benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the superior efficacy of BAGNDO, which achieved the highest classification accuracy with the most compact feature subsets in 14 out of 18 datasets. Statistical analysis, including the Wilcoxon signed-rank and Friedman tests, confirmed that BAGNDO’s performance is significantly better, establishing it as a robust and efficient solution for wrapper-based feature selection.",

The structural, microstructural, and ac electrical transport characteristics of this material were examined at high temperatures from 308 to 773 K and in a wide frequency window of 100 Hz to 1 MHz. The Rietveld refinements of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate a single-phase body-centered cubic crystal structure with space group Im-3, and A<sub>g</sub> and F<sub>g</sub> vibrational modes due to rotations of TiO<sub>6</sub> octahedra and Ti-O-Ti anti-stretching vibrations in CaCu<sub>3</sub>Ti<sub>4</sub>O<sub>12</sub>. The fitted Nyquist plots ([Formula: see text] at different temperatures exhibit the grain and grain boundary contributions, and the semicircles shrink at higher temperatures, which disclosed the negative temperature coefficient of resistance (NTCR) behavior. Both grain (R<sub>g</sub>) and grain boundary resistance (R<sub>gb</sub>) and capacitances (C<sub>g</sub>, C<sub>gb</sub>) diminished with temperature, and their activation energy was estimated to be ~ 0.56 eV and ~ 0.84 eV, respectively. The ac electrical conductivity increases with frequency and temperature due to thermally activated charge carriers, and the frequency exponent (n) remains nearly constant at low temperature region (quantum mechanical tunneling model) and decreases after 573 K (correlated barrier hopping model). Their dc activation energy was determined to be 0.51 eV and 0.62 eV, respectively. High dielectric permittivity ([Formula: see text]) ~ 9458 and low dielectric loss (δ) ~ 0.308 were observed at 308 K and frequency 100 Hz, and both values increase with the evolution of temperatures and quantify a higher ability to store the electrical charges in an electric field. The dielectric relaxations at various temperatures are associated with the Maxwell-Wagner (MW) type polarization, and the distribution of relaxation behavior or Cole-Cole parameter (α) divulged a non-ideal Debye type broader and symmetric distribution with temperatures. The modulus spectra help us to comprehend the origin of the giant dielectric constant and strong interfacial polarization by highlighting the grain and grain boundary contributions. The high dielectric constant, low loss, and high temperature stability recommend its promising applications in several electronic, energy, and sensing applications.",

    "Abstract": "Traffic flow forecasting remains an active and enduring research focus in the field of intelligent transportation systems. Most state-of-the-art forecasting models concentrate on learning general spatiotemporal patterns shared across all nodes, often neglecting spatiotemporal heterogeneity. This oversight limits their capacity to fully capture complex and dynamic dependencies in traffic data. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Spatiotemporal Heterogeneity-Aware Meta-Parameter Interaction Learning (SHAMPIL). Specifically, SHAMPIL first implicitly captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity by learning spatial and temporal embeddings, which effectively act as a clustering mechanism. Then, we introduce a new meta-parameter learning paradigm that derives modality-specific parameters from a meta-parameter pool, guided by the learned heterogeneity. Finally, a spatiotemporal interaction learning module is developed, which adaptively queries a heterogeneity-aware traffic pattern library to reconstruct data-driven dynamic graph structures, enabling interactive modeling from global to local scales. Extensive experiments on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that SHAMPIL consistently achieves superior forecasting performance compared to baseline models.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In recent years, explainable methods for artificial intelligence (XAI) have tried to reveal and describe models’ decision mechanisms in the case of classification and even for segmentation. However, XAI methods for semantic segmentation and in particular for single specific instances (e.g. one given lesion among others of the same class in medical imaging) have yet to be developed to understand what drove the detection and contouring of the latter, which is crucial for all multi-lesional diseases. We proposed instance-level explanation maps for semantic segmentation extending both SmoothGrad and Grad-CAM++ methods and yielding quantitative instance saliency for the former. The instance-level methods were applied to the segmentation of white matter lesions (WML), a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarker in multiple sclerosis (MS). 687 patients diagnosed with MS for a total of 4023 FLAIR and MPRAGE MRI scans were collected at the University Hospital of Basel, Switzerland. WM lesion masks were annotated by four expert clinicians on baseline and follow-up imaging. Three deep learning networks—a 3D U-Net, nnU-Net, and Swin UNETR—were trained and tested on these data (test normalized Dice score, respectively of 0.71, 0.78, 0.80; true positive rate of 79%, 78%, and 85%; false discovery rate of 37%, 38%, and 36%; false negative rate of 20%, 22%, and 14%), then saliency maps were computed. Consistent with clinical practice, the proposed instance saliency maps revealed that the model relied more on FLAIR than MPRAGE to segment WMLs, with positive saliency values inside a lesion and negative in its neighborhood. FLAIR hyperintensity combined with healthy WM around the lesion border was required for their detection. Beyond the aforementioned sanity checks, we observed that peak values of the generated saliency maps presented distributions that differ significantly between TP, FN, FP and TN predictions, suggesting that the quantitative nature of the proposed saliency could be used to identify errors. In conclusion, we introduced two XAI methods to generate quantitative instance-level explanations in semantic segmentation. The proposed XAI maps can be applied to any architecture and could serve as a basis to (i) improve model performance (e.g. reducing FPs), (ii) optimize their internal architecture (e.g. patch size), and (iii) justify the model’s decisions to the end users, which are contextualized to a specific lesion instance of interest.",

    "Abstract": "Although body mass index (BMI) is associated with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), its relationship with MASLD remission remains underexplored. This retrospective cohort study enrolled 2890 MASLD participants who underwent health examinations at Kuichong People's Hospital in Shenzhen from January 2018 to December 2023. MASLD remission was defined as ultrasound-confirmed complete remission of hepatic steatosis at follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression models with cubic spline functions assessed the BMI-remission relationship and explored potential nonlinearity. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of findings. After multivariable adjustment, higher BMI was negatively associated with MASLD remission (HR = 0.966, 95% CI 0.942-0.991). A nonlinear relationship was identified with an inflection point at BMI = 22.10 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Below this threshold, BMI showed a significant negative association with remission (HR = 0.929, 95% CI 0.884-0.976). Above it, no significant association was observed. Sensitivity analyses validated the stability of these results. This study reveals a negative and nonlinear BMI-MASLD remission association in Chinese adults, with stronger effects below BMI 22.10 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. These findings may provide reference for future prospective studies and clinical consultation regarding the optimization of MASLD management strategies. As a single-center study, multicenter validation is needed to confirm generalizability.",

This study investigates the correlation between volumetric changes and endocrine function of the remnant pancreas following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and distal pancreatectomy (DP). We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent PD or DP between January 2009 and December 2017 at a single institution. Pancreatic volume was assessed using contrast-enhanced computed tomography preoperatively and at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperatively. Endocrine function was evaluated using serial C-peptide index (CPI) measurements. A total of 90 PD and 45 DP patients were analyzed. Compared with initial residual volume, remnant pancreas in PD progressively declined (80.79%, 68.67%, and 65.34% at 3 months, 1 year, and 2 years; β = -11.85, p < 0.001), whereas DP patients demonstrated hypertrophic changes (106.25%, 106.62%, and 110.43%; β = 2.97, p = 0.019). New-onset diabetes occurred in 22.7% of PD and 33.3% of DP patients. Postoperative pancreatic duct dilatation was associated with greater atrophy in PD (β = -9.82, p = 0.027). Despite superior volume preservation in DP, PD demonstrated better endocrine functional recovery (CPI/volume ratio: β = 126.9, p < 0.001), corresponding with lower new-onset diabetes incidence. Pancreatic volume and endocrine function recover independently after pancreatectomy. Despite greater volume preservation, DP patients experience more endocrine dysfunction than PD due to higher islet density in the distal pancreas.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study investigates determinants of self-reported SARS-CoV-2 infection, addressing a gap in understanding how social and care-related factors are associated with infection risk among older people. We analyzed the baseline wave of “Gesundheit 65+”, a German nationwide population-registry survey. This wave was performed between June 2021 and April 2022, with a sample of 3450 participants aged 65 to 100 living in private households. SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence was 3.5% (95% confidence interval, CI 2.6–4.5), slightly higher among those aged 85+, and higher among those receiving home care, and not having double vaccination. We identified with multivariable logistic regression that not having double vaccination (odds ratio, OR = 9.72; CI 4.81–19.61), receiving in-person visits (OR = 2.96; CI 1.12–7.80), and not living alone (OR = 1.96; CI 1.02–3.76) were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, but receiving formal or informal care at home, and participating in work and social activities were not. Our results emphasize the importance of vaccination and caution during in-person interactions. Despite receiving formal or informal care at home implying close personal contact, we did not detect increased infection risk in those receiving care at home.",

    "Abstract": "Millions of individuals worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD), a chronic, incurable neurological disorder. For the longevity of people, a computer-aided system can contribute to the maximum possible extent. Recently, Deep-learning algorithms have shown better results than machine learning techniques. Researchers have applied CNN models on MRI datasets in various recent studies and have obtained promising results for the early detection of AD. This study proposes a Neuro_CBAM-ADNet diagnostic model for early prediction of the four stages of AD, using MRI digital images. The results show that the proposed model achieved mean accuracy of 98.28%±0.31, which also outperforms the previous related works. The proposed model can identify AD without human intervention and also at an economical cost with high accuracy. The optimistic findings of deep learning models in the early diagnosis of illnesses like AD show that deep learning plays a crucial role in combating these neurological diseases.",

    "Abstract": "Interferon-γ-inducible protein 30 (IFI30, also known as lysosomal thiol reductase, GILT) plays a key role in antigen processing by reducing disulfide bonds. However, its biological significance in gastric cancer (GC) has not been systematically elucidated. This study integrated pan-cancer multi-omics data, including transcriptomics (TCGA-STAD, GEO), genomics (whole-exome somatic mutations, copy number alterations), immune profiling, single-cell RNA sequencing, and transcription factor prediction to comprehensively characterize the dysregulation of IFI30 in GC. Downstream pathway involvement was inferred through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and phosphoproteomic correlation mapping. The immune microenvironment was analyzed using CIBERSORTx, TIMER2.0, and re-annotated spatial transcriptomics. Multi-omics interrogation revealed that IFI30 is markedly up-regulated in gastric adenocarcinoma (STAD) relative to normal gastric mucosa. Across TCGA-GTEx and three validation cohorts, IFI30 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in tumours, with robust diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.92). Copy-number amplification-not point mutation-was the principal genomic driver of over-expression and was accompanied by heightened genome instability and co-occurrence of TP53 and PIK3CA alterations. Single-cell RNA-seq pinpointed IFI30 enrichment in dendritic cells, CD8⁺ T cells and macrophages, forming dense ligand-receptor networks that link innate and adaptive immunity. WGCNA and pathway analyses showed that IFI30-high tumours converge on antigen presentation, cytokine/chemokine, JAK-STAT and NF-κB signalling while activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell-cycle and hypoxia programmes. IFI30 correlated strongly with multiple steps of the cancer-immunity cycle and with PD-L1, SPI1, FOXP3 and IRF1 expression. Pharmacogenomic profiling indicated resistance to MAPK- and cell-cycle inhibitors yet increased sensitivity to EGFR and PI3K/AKT blockade. IFI30-based signatures outperformed TIDE, TMB and PD-L1 in predicting immune-checkpoint-blockade response and were enriched in MSI-H tumours. In vitro, IFI30 protein was abundant in six gastric-cancer cell lines, and shRNA-mediated knock-down curtailed proliferation. Collectively, these findings establish IFI30 as a genomically driven, immunologically active and therapeutically actionable biomarker in gastric cancer. IFI30 is a copy-number-driven oncogenic and immunomodulatory gene that is markedly over-expressed in gastric adenocarcinoma. Its high expression integrates tumor-intrinsic programs (cell cycle, EMT, hypoxia) with tumor-extrinsic immune activation, predicts differential drug sensitivities, and outperforms established biomarkers in forecasting response to immune-checkpoint blockade-particularly in MSI-high disease. These findings nominate IFI30 as a promising diagnostic marker and therapeutic target.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Important porosity is commonly observed in quartz-rich rocks that viscously deformed at depths of the metamorphic continental crust. Although the presence of such pores – often occurring with angular, pyramidal shapes – has major implications for fluid circulation, mass transfer and rock strength, whether or not they are directly produced by deformation remains unclear. Here we provide detailed observations of plastically deformed, pure quartz aggregates decorated by (sub)micrometric pores in granitic shear bands (western granite, Naxos, Greece). Using electron microscopy, we demonstrate that pores (1) decorate both grain boundaries and intra-grain substructures, (2) do not necessarily align with substructures when decorating grain boundaries, and (3) interconnect through layers of amorphous SiO 2 . Transmission electron microscopy further reveals dislocation densities one (or two) order(s) of magnitude below the predictions based on the lattice curvature gradients, suggesting the occurrence of residual stress along pore-decorated, partly amorphized substructures. Challenging long-lasting hypotheses, these features are here proposed to result from stress concentration at grain and subgrain boundaries, followed by fluid exsolution into mechanically amorphized quartz. Although involving syn-kinematic processes that remain to be fully understood, our findings corroborate recent studies that emphasise stress-induced amorphization as a general process of lithospheric rock deformation.",

    "Abstract": "Intra-tumor nerve infiltration has been correlated with poor prognosis of tumor, particularly in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). While emerging evidence highlights the critical role of neuroimmune crosstalk in tumor progression and immunosuppression, the molecular mediators of this axis remain poorly understood. This study has identified cancer cell-secreted PTHLH/PTHrP as a key regulator of this neuroimmune network through integrated transcriptomic analysis, CRISPR-mediated knockout, and parallel preclinical models in immunodeficient (BALB/c nude) and immunocompetent (C57BL/6J) mice. Our finding revealed significant higher expression of PTHLH correlated with neuroimmune factors and poor prognosis in immunotherapy outcome. Genetic ablation of PTHLH significantly altered the expression of neurotrophic factors essential for intra-tumoral nerve growth. Strikingly, while PTHLH knockout showed no significant anti-tumor response in vitro and in immunodeficient mice, it dramatically reduced tumor burden in immunocompetent hosts. Comprehensive immune profiling further demonstrated enhanced immunoreactivity (increased CD8 + and CD4 + T cells) alongside reduced immunosuppression (decreased FOXP3 + Tregs and PD-L1 expression) in PTHLH-deficient tumors. Moreover, these tumors also showed lower expression of tumor proliferative and neuron markers. Together these findings established cancer cell secreted PTHLH as a critical mediator of immunosuppression and neuron infiltrations in HNSCC, particularly in tongue tumor.",

    "Abstract": "Conventional biomass fuels (e.g., untreated firewood and raw cow dung cakes) continue to be the predominant household energy source in rural areas, but this can lead to serious indoor air pollution and associated health consequences. This study presents a cost effective, scalable, and environmentally friendly energy source derived from a mixture of locally available cow dung and groundnut shell powder. Fuel cakes are made in the form of a disc so that they could be used in current rural cookstoves, making them user-friendly and requiring minimal change in cooking habits. Four different composition ratios C1 (100% cow dung), C2 (75% cow dung + 25% groundnut shell), C3 (50% cow dung + 50% groundnut shell), and C4 (25% cow dung + 75% groundnut shell) are experimented. The C4 ratio results in a 29.6% higher calorific value (19,700 ± 370 kJ kg<sup>- 1</sup>) compared to pure cow dung with significant emission reduction up to 43% of particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm in diameter, 29% of carbon dioxide, and 53% formaldehyde. The present study contributes directly to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 13 (climate action), providing a realistic solution to reduce pollution, improve indoor air quality, and promote energy equity in disadvantaged populations.",

Power consumption, surface roughness, tool wear and chip morphology were systematically evaluated under constant feed rate and depth of cut. The results demonstrate that both cutting speed and cooling/lubrication strategy significantly influence machinability performance. Dry cutting resulted in the highest power consumption and the most severe tool wear due to excessive thermal and tribological loads. In contrast the Cryo-MQL strategy achieved up to 10% energy savings at low cutting speeds and exhibited consistently reduced tool wear across the investigated cutting conditions. Cryogenic cooling improved surface integrity at low cutting speeds while comparable surface roughness values were obtained for all strategies at higher cutting speeds due to improved thermal stability. Overall the findings indicate that Cryo-MQL provides favorable performance trends and practical advantages for milling of Inconel 718 by simultaneously reducing thermal and tribological effects within the investigated parameter range.",

    "Abstract": "Semen cryopreservation and artificial insemination have crucial and beneficial effects on cattle breeding. The freezability of sperm, as primarily reflected by post-thaw sperm motility (PTM), is essential for evaluating semen quality. Some studies have shown notable differences in sperm freezability among various bulls. Here, we compared protein profiles of sperm cells and seminal plasma extracellular vesicles (SPEVs) in the high sperm freezability group and the low sperm freezability group of Holstein bulls to identify the important proteins and their mechanisms that affect sperm freezability. As a result, 432 and 394 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified in sperm and SPEVs between high and low freezability groups. The results of weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) showed that the blue module was significantly (r = 0.89, P = 9 × 10<sup>- 6</sup>) associated with sperm freezability. In addition, the pathway analysis revealed that \"Metabolic pathways\" and \"Oxidative phosphorylation\" were the predominant biological processes represented. Furthermore, 17 DEPs were found located in the previously identified QTLs related to post-thaw sperm motility, indicating possible variation in their genes. Interestingly, the expression of 142 protein pairs in sperm were significantly (|r| >0.9, P < 0.05) correlated with their expression in SPEVs. Finally, we detected genetic variations in six important candidate genes (STK38, HSPA1A, HSP90B1, LPO, DNASE2 and CUTA), and found that a missense mutation (Chr23g. 23:27522566 A > G) in HSPA1A may affect sperm freezability by decreasing the expression of HSPA1A. Our study highlighted the different protein characteristics of sperm and SPEVs in samples with distinct sperm freezability. These proteins, together with relevant SNPs might be useful markers for selecting bulls with high sperm freezability.",

    "Abstract": "Microbes drive biogeochemical changes in ecosystems, including carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Dam construction has altered riparian ecosystems worldwide, yet we know little about microbial community composition in riparian sediments and how it changes following dam removal and sediment/soil drainage. Here, we evaluate how riparian microbial communities change with increasing depth in the sediment profile for existing dams and over time following dam removal/breach and assess how various physico-chemical sediment properties influence microbial community composition. We studied microbial community structure for 12 riparian sites over a chronosequence of 0-234 years since dam breach. Sediment was collected every 0.3 m to a depth of 4 m. Aerobic taxa involved with N cycling (e.g., Nitrospirota) were dominant in surficial sediments, and increased in deeper sediments as time since dam breach increased. Anaerobic taxa implicated in C cycling (e.g., Bathyarchaeia, Anaerolineaceae) and iron reduction (e.g., Sva0485) were dominant in deeper, anoxic sediments, but declined the fastest post dam breach. These microbial trends provide insights into how riparian biogeochemical functions are impacted by dam inundation and the recovery and restoration of these ecosystems following dam removals.",

Utilizing high-frequency field data from a documented gas-lock incident-initiated by the inadvertent closure of a valve-the analysis demonstrates how a surge in the pump intake gas flow rate (from 0.2 to 0.4 MMSCFD) triggers a cascade of system failures. These include a severe oscillatory decline in the liquid flow rate of up to 300 STBD, leading to an overall production loss of 23%. The incident further induced significant system instability, manifested as amperage fluctuations between 40 and 58 A, Pump Intake Pressure (PIP) oscillations with an amplitude of ± 30 psi, and impaired motor cooling. The primary contribution of this work is a detailed causal analysis and dynamic quantification of the gas-lock progression, establishing a benchmark for its severity. These findings underscore the critical, non-negotiable requirement for proper annulus venting in both ESP design and operational procedures to prevent catastrophic production losses and equipment damage.",

    "Abstract": "Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) has emerged as a promising observational tool for a variety of geophysical monitoring applications. Its cost-effectiveness and high spatial sensor density offer a compelling alternative to traditional seismic sensors, particularly in regions where conventional deployment is challenging. DAS inherently measures strain (or strain rate), whereas conventional seismic sensors record displacement (or velocity). However, most seismological algorithms are optimized for translational ground motion data, motivating robust methods for converting DAS data into equivalent ground motion. In this work, we present a novel deep learning model that accurately converts DAS strain into geophone particle velocity trained on co-located nodal seismometers for the PoroTomo data obtained at Brady geothermal field in 2016. The model combines Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) with an attention mechanism (FNO-BiLSTM-Attention). The model is trained and evaluated using earthquake waveform data recorded simultaneously by co-located DAS channels and geophones. To validate the conversion process, we compared it with both geophone data and a physics-based conversion method. Then, a seismic beamforming analysis was performed using the deep learning-based converted DAS data, with results compared to those from the geophones. The results show an excellent match between both estimations and they are notably better than using DAS strain directly. The further improvement over using nodal data comes from improved signal coherency and density of spatial data.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Mining for fossil fuels and minerals generates spoil heaps and open pits, which have significant environmental impacts in addition to their economic contributions. Afforestation of these disturbed areas can improve soil properties, thereby increasing the functionality and resilience of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the extent of changes in soil properties following afforestation varies depending on the methods used for tree introduction. There is a need for knowledge on the effects of afforestation on soil properties, especially in post-mining Techonosols. Therefore, the objective of this research is to evaluate the effects of three afforestation methods, succession on barren spoil top (SBT), succession on reclaimed topsoil (STS), and plantation on reclaimed topsoil (PTS), on soil properties in a coal post-mining site. Soil samples were collected from 30 randomly established plots (10 × 10 m) for physical and chemical analyses, focusing on the upper layer (0–10 cm depth). The collected samples were analyzed for soil texture, bulk density (BD), porosity, air capacity, capillary water capacity (CWC), moisture content (MC), exchangeable base cations (Ca 2 ⁺, Mg 2 ⁺, K⁺, and Na⁺), total organic carbon (SOCt), SOC fractions, total nitrogen (Nt), and total sulfur (St). The results showed that PTS had significantly higher CWC, Nt, Ca 2 ⁺, K⁺, occluded light fraction of carbon (ColF), and mineral-associated carbon fraction (CMAF) compared to SBT. These improvements highlight the effectiveness of active reclamation in enhancing soil structure stability, nutrient retention, and long-term carbon stabilization, critical elements for post-mining ecosystem restoration. In contrast, SBT had greater porosity, Mg 2 ⁺, and free light fraction of carbon (CflF) than STS. In addition, SBT had greater St compared to STS and PTS. This indicates that both natural succession and active restoration contribute to soil change through different mechanisms. Therefore, the choice between afforestation strategies should depend on factors such as restoration objectives, topsoil availability, and resource constraints, as active restoration is labor-intensive and costly.",

    "Abstract": "Social cognition (SC) impairment is a hallmark of the cognitive profile in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). However, there is a still no consensus on recommended measures for SC phenotyping in this clinical population, limiting our understanding of underlying mechanism and the development of targeted intervention. This study evaluated the suitability of the Edinburgh Social Cognition test (ESCoT), a novel ecologically valid tool assessing affective (ToM<sub>A</sub>) and cognitive (ToM<sub>c</sub>) Theory of Mind, as well as interpersonal (SNU<sub>INTER</sub>) and intrapersonal (SNU<sub>INTRA</sub>) social norm understanding, for SC phenotyping in MS. Seventy-one participants (39 with MS and 32 healthy controls) completed a neuropsychological battery including both non-social (Stroop test, Digit Span) and socio-cognitive (Eyes Test, ESCoT) measures. ESCoT demonstrated strong diagnostic validity (AUC = 0.803), outperforming the Eyes test (AUC = 0.653). Notably, ESCoT captured the peculiarity SC impairment profile in MS, marked by a dissociation between affective and cognitive ToM (ToM<sub>A</sub>< ToM<sub>c</sub>; group*ToM domain interaction: F = 21.87, p < 0.001), and between interpersonal and intrapersonal SNU (SNU<sub>INTER</sub>< SNU<sub>INTRA</sub>: group*SNU domain interaction: F = 22.76, p < 0.001). In the MS group, ToM<sub>A</sub> and ToM<sub>c</sub> scores were associated with the working memory, while SNU<sub>INTRA</sub> score was linked to executive functioning. These findings support ESCoT as a valid tool for SC phenotyping in MS.",

    "Abstract": "The escalating volume of spent lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) presents a critical challenge for environmental protection and resource sustainability, driving the need for efficient cobalt(II) recovery. To overcome the limitations of conventional adsorbents, such as complex synthesis and poor selectivity, this study developed a novel imidazole-grafted polyacrylonitrile nanofiber composite (Im-g-PAN-NFs) through a facile stepwise functionalization strategy. The material was fabricated via electrospinning followed by sequential grafting with ethylenediamine and 4-methyl-5-imidazolecarboxaldehyde, introducing high-affinity coordination sites. Comprehensive characterization (FT-IR, SEM, XPS, BET) confirmed successful functionalization and revealed a roughened fibrous morphology with enhanced surface area. Batch adsorption experiments demonstrated exceptional performance: a high maximum capacity of 95.2 mg/g (Langmuir model), fast kinetics (pseudo-second-order), and outstanding selectivity for Co(II) over Li(I) (separation coefficient k<sub>(Co/Li)</sub> = 61.4). XPS analysis identified coordination with imidazole and Schiff base nitrogen as the primary mechanism. Moreover, the adsorbent exhibited excellent reusability, retaining over 83% of its initial capacity after six adsorption-desorption cycles. This work not only presents a high-performance adsorbent but also elucidates a rational design strategy combining electrospun nanofibers with targeted ligand chemistry, offering a promising and sustainable approach for selective metal recovery from complex waste streams.",

    "Abstract": "Radiation-induced skin injury (RISI) refers to injury to the skin resulting from exposure to ionizing radiation, for which current treatment options are limited. Exosomes derived from bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs-Exos) have demonstrated significant potential in tissue repair. This study evaluated the healing efficacy of BMSCs‑Exos in a rat model of RISI. BMSCs-Exos were isolated and delivered via subcutaneous injection into the RISI. Our findings revealed that BMSCs-Exos reduced the wound area and lowered the radiation injury score, thereby indicating their capacity to facilitate RISI healing. Histological analysis revealed that BMSCs-Exos enhanced epidermal repair and collagen deposition. Immunological assays revealed significantly higher CD31 and α‑SMA expression of the BMSCs‑Exos treatment group (EXO) than that of the irradiation group (IR), suggesting that BMSCs-Exos promoted angiogenesis. In the EXO group, there was also a downregulation of CD86, Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (INOS), Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α) and Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) expression, coupled with an upregulation of Macrophage Mannose Receptor 1 (CD206), Arginase-1 (Arg-1), and Interleukin-10 (IL-10) expression, indicating that BMSCs-Exos can induce macrophage polarization towards the M2 phenotype and suppress inflammation. Additionally, BMSCs-Exos decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cells. Western blot analysis of apoptosis-related proteins showed that BMSCs-Exos increased the Bcl-2 expression and reduced Bax expression and promoted phosphorylation of the Akt signaling pathway, which implied suppression of cellular apoptosis. In summary, our findings demonstrate that BMSCs-Exos promote RISI repair by regulating the inflammatory microenvironment, and inhibiting cell apoptosis.",

    "Abstract": "Climate and land-use change are reshaping the spatial ecology of migratory waterbirds, yet few studies in East Asia have quantitatively integrated ensemble species distribution models, land-cover dynamics, and multi-scenario climate projections to assess future shifts and fragmentation of wintering habitats. We quantified climate-driven changes in the wintering distributions of six rice-paddy-dependent Anatidae species across South Korea using an ensemble species distribution modelling framework integrating nine algorithms. Species occurrence data from GBIF and field surveys (2022-2024) were combined with land-cover, topographic, and bioclimatic variables, with future projections generated under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP585) and four time periods (2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2061-2080, 2081-2100). Across all scenarios, wintering distributions exhibited pronounced northward shifts, reduced spatial overlap with historical hotspots, and increasing habitat fragmentation. The loss of southern wintering grounds-historically critical as climatic refugia during extreme cold events-combined with the rapid expansion of greenhouse-based agriculture threatens the stability of emerging northern habitats. While northward shifts may facilitate adaptation to gradual warming, they also heighten vulnerability to short-term climatic extremes, forcing energetically costly movements to suboptimal sites. These findings underscore the urgency of climate-informed conservation planning.",

    "Abstract": "Today's deep neural networks have excellent performance on a variety of tasks. However, the emergence of adversarial examples has raised concerns about the security of the models. Attacks on real-world models are difficult because real-world models only return the final decision. While the decision-based attacks can generate adversarial examples solely based on the model's hard-label information, which makes it closest to real-world. However, existing decision-based attacks still require thousands of queries to generate good quality adversarial examples. Therefore, in order to generate high-quality adversarial examples with low query budget, we present a novel decision-based attack one plane one query attack (OPOQA). The main idea of the OPOQA is to generate more candidate examples in each iteration for random exploration of the decision boundary and select the most suitable adversarial example for the next iteration. In each iteration, we sample from the low-frequency discrete cosine transform (DCT) space and transform it back to the pixel space via inverse DCT (iDCT). This generates a set of random vectors in the pixel space which form a two-dimensional (2D) plane. Only one candidate sample is generated on this plane to reduce the number of queries. Non-target attacks on six mainstream models-Inception-v3, ResNet, VGG, Vit, and others-performed on the ImageNet validation set (200 randomly selected images) show that, with a query budget of 1000 and RMSE thresholds of 0.05 and 0.01(where RMSE ≤ 0.05 represents disturbances that are virtually imperceptible to the human eyes), the attack success rates of our method against Inception-v3 achieves 94% and 49%, compared to the state-of-the-art EPCA algorithm, the attack success rates increased by 4.5% and 11.5%, respectively.

    "Abstract": "Brain tumor MRI segmentation and classification are essential for preoperative boundary assessment, lesion burden quantification, postoperative response monitoring, and radiotherapy planning, yet edema overlap, sequence heterogeneity, and artifacts often blur lesion margins. Together with the high cost of pixel-level annotation, these factors limit robust, cross-institution deployment. We propose DARE-FUSE (Domain Aligned Representation with Evidence-guided FUSE), a unified framework for pixel-level segmentation and image-level classification under limited samples and labels. Dual encoders with a feature-interaction bridge learn a shared embedding, and a Domain Alignment Refiner maps it to task-aligned representations for the segmentation and classification branches. For segmentation, U-SEG decodes features and SEGU outputs pixel-wise uncertainty to regularize boundary over/under-segmentation. For classification, CPG produces predictions and multi-scale Grad-CAM++ evidence. A Generative Lesion Removal Prior reconstructs a tumor-free counterpart to yield a difference prior, and FUSE combines this prior with Grad-CAM++ under uncertainty attenuation to guide segmentation and suppress hallucinations. DARE-FUSE achieves stable, leading performance on BraTS segmentation benchmarks and several classification datasets; ablations and label-reduction experiments confirm complementary gains and smooth degradation as pixel annotations decrease. The resulting uncertainty maps and continuous priors support interpretable decision assistance in surgery, radiotherapy contouring, triage, and longitudinal follow-up.",

    "Abstract": "Cholecystectomy is associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS); however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. The gallbladder acts as a storage organ for hepatic bile and regulates the feeding/fasting cycles of bile acid (BA) flow in the enterohepatic circulation (EHC). In this study, we aimed to use C57BL/6 mice to investigate the effects of cholecystectomy in the regulation of glucose homeostasis and bile acid metabolism with metabolomics and quantitative RT-PCR. The results show that cholecystectomy increases fasting hepatic BA levels by enhancing EHC. Livers from cholecystectomized (XGB) mice displayed suppression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), abnormal lipid accumulation, and marked remodeling of their metabolomic profiles, particularly a reduction in FAO intermediate acylcarnitines. Many FAO genes were transcriptional targets of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), and BA inhibited PPARα, resulting in impeded FAO. Consistent with this, blocking intestinal BA uptake using an apical sodium-BA transporter inhibitor enhanced fasting hepatic FAO levels and ameliorated metabolic disorders in XGB mice. These findings suggest that cholecystectomy could inhibit fasting hepatic FAO by disturbing the EHC of BA, and reveal the role of the gallbladder in coordinating PPARα-regulated FAO in the liver.",

    "Abstract": "Mixed-species plantations have been increasingly promoted as a strategy to enhance ecosystem functioning and related ecosystem processes; however, their global impacts on biomass production and nutrient cycling remain uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive meta-analysis based on a random-effects model of 8,450 paired observations from 328 studies spanning diverse climatic zones, stand structures, and silvicultural systems. We demonstrate that species mixing significantly enhances plant biomass and nutrient content compared to monocultures, with positive responses observed across trees, shrubs, litterfall, and both above- and belowground compartments. Mixed-species plantations also increase soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, phosphorus availability, microbial biomass, and leaf nutrient content while maintaining stable soil stoichiometric ratios, collectively reflecting more efficient stand-level nutrient cycling. Importantly, the magnitude of these effects was shaped by climatic and structural contexts, with stronger positive outcomes under warmer and wetter climates, increasing with species richness, and showing unimodal responses to elevation, stand age, and stand density. By synthesizing multi-scale evidence from diverse ecosystems, we reveal that species mixing promotes biomass accumulation, improves nutrient retention, and strengthens biodiversity-nutrient cycling linkages. This study highlights the potential of mixed-species plantations to enhance ecological function, advance forest restoration, and guide plantation management across diverse environmental conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Hydrothermal vents release substantial amounts of ancient carbon into the ocean, primarily as carbon dioxide, yet the extent to which this carbon is integrated into marine food webs remains poorly constrained. Here, we present a combination of bulk radiocarbon and stable carbon isotope measurements of particulate organic carbon from water column filters with compound-specific hydrogen and radiocarbon isotope analyses of fatty acids from surface sediments to trace carbon assimilation across benthic and pelagic realms in a low pH, shallow-water hydrothermal system off Taiwan. Isotope correlations indicate that vent-derived carbon dioxide constitutes a substantial fraction of the local microbial and faunal biomass through chemoautotrophic pathways (up to ~30%). Farther from the vents, hydrothermal carbon remains detectable and is incorporated into photoautotrophic biomass in the overlying water column. Notably, ancient carbon content in the standing stock of particulate organic carbon was higher at the lower temperature (“White”) vent, even though fluid and sulfide emissions – and thus potential energy availability – were substantially greater at the higher temperature (“Yellow”) vent. These findings show that physicochemical conditions, including pH and temperature, rather than fluid chemistry alone, control carbon assimilation patterns and ultimately limit the retention of vent-derived carbon in this shallow-water system.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Antibiotic resistance (AR) is an escalating public health threat, necessitating innovative strategies to control resistant bacterial populations. One promising approach involves engineering genetic elements that can spread within microbial communities to eliminate AR genes. Previously, we developed Pro-Active Genetics (Pro-AG), a CRISPR-based gene-drive-like system capable of reducing AR colony-forming units (CFU) by approximately five logs. Here, we advance this technology by integrating Pro-AG into a conjugative transfer system, enabling efficient dissemination of an anti-AR gene cassette between two bacterial strains. Additionally, we characterize a complementary homology-based deletion (HBD) process, a CRISPR-driven mechanism that precisely removes target DNA sequences flanked by short direct repeats. Our findings reveal that Pro-AG and HBD are differentially influenced by the bacterial RecA pathway and that HBD components can be delivered via plasmids or phages to selectively delete Pro-AG cassettes. This built-in safeguard prevents uncontrolled spread of a gene cassette and mitigates unanticipated side effects. These refinements enhance the efficiency and flexibility of Pro-AG, expanding its potential applications in microbiome engineering, environmental remediation, and clinical interventions aimed at combating antibiotic resistance. More broadly, this work establishes a proof-of-principle for microbiome engineering strategies that could be leveraged to improve health and restore ecological balance.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The emergence of phototrophy is one of the most significant innovations in the history of life, vastly increasing available metabolic energy. Phototrophy is, however, known to have arisen only twice. This raises a curious question: if phototrophy was accessible enough to evolve twice, why has it never arisen again despite billions of years of subsequent evolution? Through physiological modeling, we demonstrate that chlorophototrophy and retinalophototrophy together saturate the bioenergetic landscape available to light-harvesting systems. They represent opposite solutions to key biophysical trade-offs: maximizing efficiency per photon versus maximizing metabolic flux, specialization versus versatility, and sophistication versus simplicity. Together they create an evolutionary priority effect, blocking any newly-arising phototrophic system from succeeding. By revealing the basis of this competitive exclusion, our work sheds light on a general principle - that early innovations can saturate ecological space such that they constrain future evolutionary possibilities, making apparently ‘easy’ innovations appear as rare events.",

Synucleinopathy, the α-syn-related pathology, is the central to the pathogenetic processes observed in the brains of patients with PD, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). We are seeking an animal model with synucleinopathy that can comprehensively replicate these pathologies and adhere to suitable timeframes for preclinical research for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying the mutated human α-syn gene and S87N α-syn preformed fibrils (PFF) were co-injected into the left substantia nigra (SN) of mouse brains. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PET/CT imaging were performed at different time points to detect the key pathologies in the brain. This model resulted in accelerated α-syn pathology, detectable as early as two weeks post-injection, alongside DA neuron loss, microglial activation, reduced synaptic density, and impaired mitochondrial function within five weeks. Pathology remained spatially localized. In summary, this AAV/PFF hybrid model offers a rapid, region-specific platform for studying synucleinopathies such as PD, as well as for evaluating PET ligands for disease diagnosis and monitoring.",

The serial production of quantum devices needs the on-chip integration of all these photonic components. These requirements motivate the hetero-integration of materials with complementary properties. Diamond color centers provide access to spin registers, long coherence times, and suitability for quantum networking. In contrast, aluminum gallium nitride-on-aluminum nitride (AlGaN/AlN) photonics features second-order nonlinear and first-order electro-optic effects. Here, we demonstrate the accurate integration of diamond waveguides containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers into AlGaN/AlN waveguides using a pick-and-place method. Both waveguides possess tapered sections for adiabatic mode transfer. We model the tapered diamond-AlGaN/AlN interface with finite element simulations, implementing fabrication constraints and placement uncertainties.

    "Abstract": "Obesity remains the most common risk factor for cardiovascular disease in Western nations. While considerable effort has focused on identifying risk factors, which contribute to the increase incidence of complications and disease, an emerging concept is the existence of resilience factors, which mitigate disease. An important resilience factor gaining increased appreciation is the amount of skeletal muscle mass. In this review, we will explore how obesity increases the most-identified vascular component of metabolic vascular disease - endothelial dysfunction-how increases in muscle mass may protect vascular function in the obese population. This review advances the concept the obesity is less a disease of body mass than body composition which is reflected in the degree of negative vascular outcomes and may be of increased relevance in consideration of therapies that promote loss of muscle mass while reducing overall body size.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Turmeric ( Curcuma longa ) is an economically important crop native to hot and humid regions of India. The current study aims to establish the basis for a multifaceted understanding of turmeric plants’ cellular and physiological responses to heat stress. We combined transcriptomic (RNA-seq) analysis, real-time photosynthesis data, and profiles of emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) to interpret the responses of turmeric plants to heat stress. RNAseq data indicated significant differential expression in 41.8% of genes, with photosynthesis-related genes overrepresented. Photosynthetic rate measurements demonstrated an almost complete failure of photosynthesis at 41 °C, followed by incomplete recovery at a normal temperature of 21 °C. Emissions of almost all detected BVOCs increased considerably during periods of heat treatment. The data establishes the ontological gene groups most affected, estimates the temperature tolerance of turmeric, and provides insights into plant responses to climate change.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Kidney organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells have emerged as promising models for studying kidney disease and therapeutic development. However, the lack of a scalable production system has limited their industrial applications in regenerative medicine. Here, we have developed a cost-effective mass-production method for manufacturing vascularized kidney organoids, which has improved production efficiency by more than 50 times compared to conventional culture systems. The incorporation of a dynamic culture environment in delta-wing stirred bioreactors has significantly enhanced the glomerular vascularization of kidney organoids via mechanosensory integrin α2β1. Single-cell RNA sequencing and functional analyses demonstrated the enhanced maturation in STR nephron epithelia. The large quantities of vascularized kidney organoids enabled the fabrication of a nephron sheet with nephron numbers equivalent to those found in two rat kidneys. Intravital imaging of a nephron sheet implanted in a dorsal skinfold chamber of mice revealed filtration function with size selectability in the organoid glomeruli vascularized with human endothelia. This work may represent a significant step towards bridging the gap between basic research and commercial products, paving the way towards developing bioengineered kidneys for kidney replacement therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Graph deep learning models, a class of AI-driven approaches employing a message aggregation mechanism, have gained popularity for analyzing the functional brain connectome in neuroimaging. However, their actual effectiveness remains unclear. In this study, we re-examine graph deep learning versus classical machine learning models based on four large-scale neuroimaging studies. Surprisingly, we find that the message aggregation mechanism, a hallmark of graph deep learning models, does not help with predictive performance as typically assumed, but rather consistently degrades it. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid model combining a linear model with a graph attention network through dual pathways, achieving robust predictions and enhanced interpretability by revealing both localized and global neural connectivity patterns. Our findings urge caution in adopting complex deep learning models for functional brain connectome analysis, emphasizing the need for rigorous experimental designs to establish tangible performance gains and perhaps more importantly, to pursue improvements in model interpretability.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Ensemble weather forecasts provide a probabilistic description of the future state of the atmosphere and give users flow-dependent estimates of forecast uncertainty. Here, we introduce AIFS-CRPS, an ensemble variant of the machine-learned Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS) developed at ECMWF. Its loss function is the almost fair Continuous Ranked Probability Score (afCRPS). It is based on a proper score, the CRPS, but approximately removes the bias in the score due to finite ensemble size yet avoids a degeneracy of the fair CRPS. The trained model is stochastic and can generate as many exchangeable members as desired. For medium-range forecasts AIFS-CRPS outperforms the physics-based Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) ensemble for the majority of variables and lead times. For subseasonal forecasts, AIFS-CRPS outperforms the IFS ensemble before calibration and is competitive with the IFS ensemble when forecasts are evaluated as anomalies to remove the influence of model biases.",

In this systematic review, we discuss the key cognitive stages where naming can fail: facial recognition, person-specific semantics, and proper-name retrieval. We examine claims that PNA is an early indicator of AD and review studies that have attempted to treat PNA in individuals with AD. Twenty-two eligible studies were included. The main findings are that individuals with AD frequently experience difficulties in recalling proper names at any point in the disease process, with the distribution of functional breakdown between the three key cognitive stages involved in successful naming being: facial recognition (19%), person-specific semantics (30%), and proper-name retrieval (40%). PNA can be an early manifestation of AD. Effective behavioural treatments are available for those whose naming difficulties occur at the retrieval stage, including trial-by-trial practice using vanishing cues and spaced retrieval. We also provide clinical recommendations regarding the diagnosis and treatment of PNA.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Post-winter haze events in Delhi, India, comprise great air quality challenges, yet remain poorly understood due to limited measurements of vertical profiles of particulate matter (PM) concentrations. This study employs a drone-mounted PM low-cost sensor (PM-LCS) with an optimized sampling system to capture vertical PM 2.5 profiles during March 2021. Elevated PM 2.5 concentrations (160 µg/m 3 ) were observed at an altitude of 100 m, being 60% higher than ground level. Vertical profiles of the PM 1 /PM 2.5 ratio under humid conditions (RH &gt; 70%), showed that haze formation is likely driven by hygroscopic inorganic aerosols. Comparison with model simulations showed significant underestimation of PM 2.5 (−52.6 ± 5.5%) during morning haze episodes, coinciding with a dry bias in modeled RH (−30.1 ± 8.3%). During non-hazy episodes, PM 2.5 underestimation decreased to 10.8 ± 1.2% with a minimal RH bias. This suggests that the dry bias of the model limits its ability to simulate aerosol hygroscopic growth. Overall, our findings demonstrate that drone-mounted PM-LCS provides a valuable vertical air quality assessment tool.",

The impact of short-term changes in air pollution and meteorological factors on RSV epidemics, particularly their spatial variations, remains unclear. We conducted a time-series analysis to investigate the association between short-term environmental changes and weekly RSV infection in Chile. Weekly data on the number of new laboratory RSV tests and confirmed RSV-positive cases, meteorological factors, and air pollutants were collected from 16 Chilean regions (2015–2018). We fitted a quasi-Poisson regression to evaluate the link between short-term environmental changes and RSV infection in each region. We utilized random effects meta-analyses to pool the region-specific estimates. Subgroup analyses were further conducted to assess variations by socio-economic and geographical context. Nationwide associations were observed between weekly average temperature and RSV activity, with a 1 °C increase being positively associated with an 8.2% (95% confidence interval: 0.87–0.97) decrease in RSV positivity at a lag of 3 weeks.

    "Abstract": "Abstract The colonization of other worlds has been a long-standing desire of humankind. This has yet to occur due to several challenges, one of which is the difficulty of transporting building materials from Earth to the intended extraterrestrial site. Inevitably, the utilization of in situ resources, such as regolith for habitat construction, is crucial to the sustainability of extraterrestrial exploration. In this work, we employ a recently developed constitutive rheological model, using non-equilibrium thermodynamics, that can accurately predict the rheological response of lunar regolith simulant and alkaline solution pastes, which behave like cementitious-like pastes using a chemical reaction known as geopolymerization. The model has been carefully calibrated using experimental data from the literature for three temperatures and two water-to-binder ratio values. A key advantage of the current rheological model over the traditional phenomenological models commonly used to predict the response of lunar regolith simulant pastes, such as the Bingham and Herschel–Bulkley models, is its capacity to predict normal stresses. As this is the first rheological model of its kind, we expect it to be highly valuable for future additive manufacturing (3D printing) simulations, particularly as additive manufacturing gradually becomes the preferred method for constructing extraterrestrial habitats.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Microplastics (MPs) are considered a global emerging threat. Environmental MP monitoring is essential for understanding and managing MP pollution. Here, a convolutional neural network model was developed for the infrared spectral classification of MPs from the environment. During model development, data were collected from multiple sources (e.g. OpenSpecy) to ensure sufficient intra-class diversity, for improving generalization. Also, the uncertainty threshold and OpenMax (an open-set recognition technique) were applied to enable the model to handle unknown classes (classes not included in model training) that may be present in real-world environmental samples. Furthermore, a targeted data augmentation strategy was proposed to improve model performance across varying infrared spectral ranges. Results show that the targeted data augmentation improved classification accuracy by up to 4.6%. In the optimal uncertainty threshold range of 0.87 ± 0.01, the model achieved 93.1% accuracy on both the known-class test spectra (15,741 spectra) and the unknown-class test spectra (6,279 spectra). OpenMax also enabled the model to effectively handle the unknown-class test spectra. Notably, its ability to recognize unknown classes is more prominent at lower uncertainty thresholds. The strategies proposed here could potentially be extended to other fields, e.g., food safety, pharmaceutical quality control, where spectral classification is critical.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Meeting the growing demand for urban housing is a global sustainability challenge. Numerous studies have concluded that bio-based materials are lower carbon options compared to concrete while disregarding resource availability and harvesting emissions. This study evaluates low-carbon concrete in comparison to engineered bio-based materials and stabilized earth blocks for three issues: embodied carbon, material supply limitations and production scalability. Bio-based materials could only supply &lt;14% of global demand due to limited forest area within assumed conditions of sustainable harvesting yields. In contrast, adoption of low-carbon concrete is not resource-limited, with potential savings of 14.3 Gt.CO 2(eq.) achievable versus benchmark concrete housing from 2025-2050. Furthermore, engineered biomaterial production would need to scale up faster than low-carbon concrete, while also overcoming greater logistical and social barriers. To meet urban housing needs, low-carbon concrete is not perfect but is the lowest-carbon option that can be scaled-up to meet global demand by 2050.",

Effect sizes across studies and sensitivity values of the different scoring procedures were obtained. Results: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The findings showed that combined methods involving joint online and offline scoring and scoring procedures that calculated the percentage of number of words correct were as reliable as the more popular offline scoring procedure. Conclusions: The clinical and social implications of using NWR tests to assess phonological processing in CWS are discussed. Recommendations are made concerning how future studies can improve the quality of procedures used in NWR testing.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Links between the eye and the central nervous system (CNS) have been recognized since the origins of the ophthalmoscope. Owing to the elegant topography of the afferent visual pathway and its close embryonic, anatomical, and physiological connections to the brain, it is possible to capture structural effects of CNS injury in the retina. The availability of large-scale, high-quality retinal imaging datasets and ongoing advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have paved the way for Oculomics, a field in which ocular measures act as biomarkers for systemic diseases. Similarly, ocular images have been used in AI models to provide critical insights about neurologic disorders in the fledgling discipline of what might be considered Neuro-Oculomics. In this review, we will describe key ocular imaging techniques and highlight emerging roles for AI in the diagnosis and management of important neurological conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the global portrayal of China’s diplomatic image through media representations of the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Focusing on participating countries (Pakistan and Hungary) and non-participating countries (the United States and the United Kingdom), the research conducts a comparative analysis of a 50,444-word corpus from Daily News Hungary , The News International , the BBC, and VOA over a four-month period (Sep. 11, 2023 – Jan. 25, 2024). Using a critical discourse analysis (CDA) framework, specifically Fairclough’s three-dimensional model, the study adopts both qualitative and quantitative approaches to examine how the BRI is portrayed, identify similarities and differences in China’s diplomatic image, and analyze the discursive strategies employed. The findings reveal that material and relational processes dominate the reports, with non-participating countries using more derogatory language compared to their counterparts. While media generally adhere to journalistic standards, they are influenced by national ideologies. Participating countries’ media show strong support for the BRI, while non-participating countries’ media express skepticism, though some objective voices emerge. This research sheds light on how media discourse shapes global perceptions of China’s diplomacy, reflecting underlying power dynamics and national interests.",

    "Abstract": "Cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) is a key member of the family of organometallic molecular catalysts. Consequently, both experimental and theoretical investigations of CNCbl are essential for advancing the fundamental understanding of its structural and catalytic properties. However, the inherent complexity of its molecular architecture poses significant challenges for theoretical studies. To address this, several studies have employed simplified structural models of CNCbl. In the present work, we systematically investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of various reduced CNCbl models, alongside the complete CNCbl molecule, using density functional theory. Our results reveal that the electronic structure, magnetic behavior, and oxidation state undergo substantial modifications in the reduced models compared to the full CNCbl system. In particular, the complete CNCbl structure exhibits a non-magnetic semiconducting character with a +3 oxidation state of the Co center, whereas the overly simplified models display magnetic behavior with a +2 oxidation state. These pronounced changes in oxidation and magnetic character also lead to significant alterations in catalytic properties. The influence of these effects is further demonstrated through Cl adsorption studies. In the full CNCbl model, Cl binds strongly at the Co site, while in the reduced models, the interaction becomes considerably weaker. These findings underscore that, despite advances in computational resources, the use of oversimplified CNCbl models can yield misleading predictions. Therefore, the complete CNCbl structure should be preferred for reliable theoretical investigations of both its fundamental and catalytic behavior.",

    "Abstract": "We report over 3 kV breakdown voltage and ultra-low leakage (011) β-Ga2O3 power devices utilizing Schottky barrier engineering and high-permittivity (κ) dielectric (ZrO2) field plate. The (011) orientation of β-Ga2O3 enabled low background doping and thick drift layers, which are promising to support kV class vertical β-Ga2O3 power switches. The Schottky barrier engineering was performed with a composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) anode contact to take advantage of the enhanced reverse blocking capabilities enabled by PtOx while allowing low turn-on voltage by the interfacing thin Pt layer. We also performed a systematic study using a co-processed Pt/(011) β-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) on the same wafer. The bare SBDs revealed a breakdown voltage of ∼1.5 kV, while the field-plate Pt/(011) β-Ga2O3 SBDs achieved an increased breakdown voltage of 2.75 kV owing to the edge field management. Further enhancement of the breakdown voltage was achieved by tunneling leakage management using composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts that ultimately enabled a breakdown voltage of 3.7 kV for the field-plate diodes. Remarkably, the Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) Schottky contacts maintained a similar turn-on voltage as the Pt/(011) β-Ga2O3 SBDs. The combination of efficient tunneling leakage management by composite Pt cap/PtOx/Pt (1.5 nm) contacts with similar turn-on voltage, edge field reduction by high-κ dielectric ZrO2 field plate, as well as the advantageous material properties offered by (011) β-Ga2O3 demonstrates a promising strategy for developing ultra-low leakage and multi-kV class vertical (011) β-Ga2O3 power devices.",

In this letter, we re-examined the EA of Se using the slow-electron velocity-map imaging method and revealed a substantial deviation in the LPM result. Measurements for the different isotopes of Se and the energy-level splitting of the neutral Se atom’s 3P2–3P1 further verified the accuracy and robustness of our SEVI method. Based on this experimental evidence, we recommended a revised EA(Se) value of 16 297.78(4) cm−1, which is in excellent agreement with the previous laser photodetachment threshold experimental results.",

It noncompetitively inhibits the human norepinephrine transporter (hNET) leading to reduced allodynia in animal models of neuropathic pain. Rational design was used to prune conotoxin χMr1a while maintaining the armacophore that led to the development of an equipotent mimetic (IC 50 : 760 nM). Surprisingly, oxidative folding of the reduced linear peptide led to four rather than the expected three isoforms. Detailed investigation led to the discovery of two stereotopological isoforms one of which in the globular fold was &amp;gt;1000 fold more potent than the other isoform both in vitro and in vivo in an allodynia mouse mode. Stereotopological isoforms have never been reported for conotoxins and represent an additional level of structural complexity with implications for rational design, chemical synthesis and structural diversity of cysteine rich peptides.",

He studied Medicine at the University of Queensland, completed a PhD at the University College Hospital, London, and qualified as an Anatomical Pathologist and a Physician in both Australia and England. Most of his working life was spent at the University of Queensland, where he was Professor of Pathology for 20 years and also at the Royal Brisbane Hospital. As well as being a gifted and meticulous researcher, he was an inspirational lecturer. His life-long hobby was as a lepidopterist, and his impressive collection of butterflies and moths, one of the best in the country, was donated to the Australian National Insect Collection, a major scientific resource managed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. He received numerous highly competitive awards for his ground-breaking research, including Officer in the General Division of the Order of Australia; the Fred W. Stewart Award, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre; the Paul Ehrlich and Ludwig Darmstaedter Prize; and the International Charles IV Prize, Charles University and the City of Prague (Fig. 1.).

    "Abstract": "Background: research on pornography use and casual sex has lacked a comprehensive understanding of university women’s engagement with such content. To address this gap, we examined pornography use, sexual motives, and hookup behavior among university women in China from a sexual scripting perspective. Methods: Participants (N = 1242) provided self-reported data on their frequency of pornography viewing, motives for and against sex, and hookup behavior. Results: The findings showed that pornography consumption was positively associated with hookup behaviors. Pornography use was also positively correlated with all motives for sex and negatively correlated with not ready motives. In turn, hookup behaviors were positively associated with enhancement and coping motives but negatively associated with value and not ready motives. Moreover, some of these motives (e.g., enhancement and not ready) partly explained the link between pornography use and hookup. Conclusion: These findings underscore the association between pornography use and casual sex engagement among Chinese university women, with specific motives for and against sex playing a relevant role. These insights may help inform targeted sexual health promotion strategies that support autonomy and sexual well-being among Chinese college women.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract By the late Middle Ages, a part of South Slavic, including Macedonian and Bulgarian, had lost nominal case inflection, leading to the disappearance of the old Slavic differential object marking (DOM) system. In the 19th century, some southern Macedonian dialects developed a new DOM system based on the preposition na ‘on, to’. This study explores the evolution of this DOM system by comparing Southern Macedonian texts from two periods — the mid-19th century and mid-20th century. The main factors conditioning DOM include animacy (humanness), definiteness, and the lexical class of the verb. We observe a general increase in the na -marking and a shift from optionality toward automatization. In early texts, the na -marking sporadically occurs with pronouns and definite human-referring nouns. In later texts, pronouns and human proper names are almost always marked, whereas marking of definite human-referring common nouns remains optional, albeit with increasing frequency over time. We also report negative evidence for other factors frequently mentioned in typological works on DOM, such as the disambiguating function of case within the global discourse context. Notably, this factor does not emerge as significant in Macedonian.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Describing a modern variety of Martinique Creole spoken by French-Creole bilinguals, we show that this language uses two different subgrammars to express ‘definiteness’, viz to signal a uniqueness presupposition on a discourse referent: (i) the enclitic determiner - la , arguably located in a phrase-peripheral D head which has been shown by Térosier ( 2021 , 2022 ) to convey two subtypes of discourse-linking; (ii) a dedicated morphosyntax for noun phrases we call names , which are rigid designators. Our study leads us to distinguish names (a class of noun phrases) from proper nouns (a class of lexemes); and to discard the assumption that Definiteness instantiates a single feature (possibly either ‘strong’ or ‘weak’) linked to a single phrase-peripheral D head (Longobardi passim , Matushansky 2023 ). The grammar of MQ rather indicates that uniqueness presuppositions may arise independently of the D head.",

This paper proposes the Motion Energy Measurement (MEM) system, an extension of the MTM-UAS method for assessing manual tasks. While MTM-UAS standardises task timing through basic motion units, it does not account for physiological workload.MEM addresses this gap by integrating metabolic energy expenditure models into each MTM-UAS motion element, enabling quantifiable assessment of physiological workload. A case study conducted at Bosch Thermotechnology in Portugal, involving a hot water boiler assembly line, revealed a disparity between task duration uniformity (CV <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math> 0.5%) and energy variability (CV <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mml:mrow><mml:mo>≈</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math> 11.7%) across operators. These results expose critical ergonomic blind spots in time-based balancing strategies and underline the potential of MEM for real-time identification of high-strain tasks.

Rather than simply promoting infertility treatment, some doctors act paternalistically as \"moral pioneers\" and \"moral guardians,\" reappropriating moral authority granted by biomedical expertise to persuade many women of \"advanced maternal age\" seeking a second child through ART to reconsider or discontinue treatment. Their reasoning arises from navigating contradictory reproductive governance while drawing on personal moral values. While reinforcing state narratives on declining fertility, they also provide medical justifications for forgoing treatment, offering some women an alternative model of femininity.",

    "Abstract": "Disagreement as to whether the auditory cortical center was located in the superior temporo-sphenoidal lobe-as proposed by David Ferrier in 1875, but apparently negated by the later experiments of Edward Schäfer-came to a head following an experimental demonstration given by Schäfer at a meeting of the Neurological Society of London in March 1887. Previous attempts to document the Ferrier-Schäfer dispute have been based on contemporary published sources, which are limited. Here we present documents not hitherto identified and/or transcribed to our knowledge that shed further light on the debate between Schäfer and Ferrier on the cortical localization of the auditory center. They permit a more detailed historical reconstruction of events that provides no definitive behavioral-pathological evidence to support Schäfer's claim to have disproved Ferrier's original localization.",

    "Abstract": "The development of polymer prodrugs with well-defined architectures capable of forming stable nanomicelles is important for achieving precise and efficient drug delivery. Compared with conventional linear systems, star-shaped copolymer prodrugs offer enhanced micellar stability owing to their covalently tethered architecture. However, many existing synthetic approaches rely on transition-metal catalyzed polymerization and customized monomers, which limit their sustainability and practical applicability. Herein, we report a pH-responsive doxorubicin (DOX)-conjugated benzaldehyde-functionalized star-shaped copolymer synthesized via an environmentally benign metal-free atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) strategy. A hydroxyl-functionalized star-shaped copolymer scaffold was first prepared from readily available monomers and subsequently modified to introduce pendant benzaldehyde groups, enabling DOX conjugation through acid-labile imine linkages. This approach affords well-controlled polymer architectures while avoiding transition-metal residues and the need for pre-functionalized monomers. The resulting DOX-conjugated star-shaped copolymers form unimolecular micelles with high colloidal stability and exhibit pH-triggered drug release under acidic conditions. In vitro studies further demonstrate effective cellular internalization and a moderated cytotoxic profile toward human large-cell lung carcinoma (H460) cells, supporting the functional viability of this micellar system as a polymer prodrug delivery platform.",

    "Abstract": "Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), a persistent environmental pollutant, is associated with cognitive dysfunction through mechanisms involving neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic disruption. Icaritin, a bioactive flavonoid with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, exhibits therapeutic potential, though its efficacy against PFOS-induced cognitive impairment remains unexplored. Herein, a mouse model of PFOS-induced cognitive dysfunction was established and treated with oral ICT. Integrated 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics revealed that ICT restored gut microbial homeostasis by enriching beneficial genera (e.g. <i>Akkermansia</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>) and reducing ammonia-producing bacteria (e.g. <i>Proteus</i>, <i>Helicobacter</i>, <i>Escherichia</i>), thereby improving gut barrier integrity. Metabolomic profiling identified significant perturbations in ammonia-related pathways, particularly arginine and proline metabolism, underscoring ammonia dysmetabolism as a pivotal mediator of PFOS neurotoxicity. These modifications attenuated systemic and cerebral ammonia accumulation, mitigated neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, and ultimately improved cognitive function. Our findings elucidate ammonia dysmetabolism as a central mechanism in PFOS-induced cognitive decline and highlight the microbiota-gut-brain axis as a promising therapeutic target. This study provides a mechanistic foundation for targeting microbial and metabolic pathways in environmental neurotoxicity.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the evolving trends and future directions of da’wah research through an integrated bibliometric–thematic analysis, a dual methodological approach rarely applied in Islamic communication studies. Drawing on 146 Scopus-indexed journal articles published between 2002 and 2024, the study maps publication trends, collaboration patterns and thematic structures within global da’wah scholarship. The findings reveal a clear shift from traditional, institution-centered da’wah toward digitally mediated and interactive forms of religious communication, with social media emerging as a central thematic hub. Scholarly output is dominated by Indonesia and Malaysia, particularly in relation to pesantren-based education and interdisciplinary approaches linking theology and media. Despite steady growth in publications, declining average citation rates indicate a persistent productivity–visibility gap and limited global research impact. The thematic analysis further shows that much of the literature remains conceptual, with few empirical evaluations of digital da’wah effectiveness. By integrating bibliometric mapping with thematic interpretation, this study advances methodological approaches and provides evidence-based insights for scholars, practitioners and policymakers seeking to develop ethical and context-sensitive da’wah strategies in the digital era.",

    "Abstract": "The nature of the animal-face pattern remains a central problem in Chinese art history. Moving beyond traditional debates focused on macroscopic features, this study proposes a novel analytical framework centered on two micro-decorative units: the T-shaped and F-shaped motif. We trace their pre-Shang antecedents to the Erlitou, Shimao, and Longshan cultures. Our analysis demonstrates that Shang artists systematized these inherited motifs into a combinatorial grammar to construct the animal-face’s body, primarily through T-dominant, F-dominant, and integrated T + F schemes. A systematic comparison reveals that this specific decorative grammar is uniquely shared with dragon iconography, while being distinctly different from the body decoration of tiger motifs. This evidence from micro-ornamentation provides compelling new support for the hypothesis that the dragon served as the primary zoological prototype for the Shang animal-face pattern, offering a refined perspective grounded in the analysis of its constituent parts.",

The protagonist finds herself in a cruel Indian-hating boarding school system that continuously ‘disciplines’ her Indian self. However, going back to her mother in the reservation land, she regains a sense of belonging leading her to be a defiant Indian woman. This paper identifies the first phase of the protagonist’s life at boarding school as a form of survivance as described by Gerald Vizenor since at that time it was necessary for her to survive though she made occasional resistance. Then, the phase of her soul-regaining and finally, resigning the job from a settler colonial institution may be seen as a form of thrivance as described by Taté Walker. This way, the paper maps a journey from survivance to thrivance observing the life of the protagonist in select stories that appeared in American Indian Stories.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives. Local muscle quantity and quality in the human leg have been assessed simultaneously across multiple muscle compartments by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) imaging. Approach. Three EIT parameters are defined, which are (1) the spatial-mean conductivity &lt;σ&gt; (2) the spatial-mean phase angle &lt;Φ&gt;, and (3) the mean resistance R ̅. Three parameters are assessed in the calf and thigh of ten subjects by comparing &lt;σ&gt; with the local muscle thickness t by ultrasound, &lt;Φ&gt; with the local fat infiltration ratio FIR by ultrasound, and R ̅ with the ratio of extracellular water to total body water (ECW/TBW) e by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). Moreover, three parameters are compared with isometric strength tests, which assess knee extension power, knee flexion power, ankle plantar flexion power, and ankle flexion power. Main results. As the experimental results, the local muscle quantity and quality in the calf and thigh of ten subjects were imaged using σ and Φ distributions. Moreover, &lt;σ&gt; has a positive correlation with t (correlation coefficient cc = 0.735, p &lt; 0.05), &lt;Φ&gt; has a negative moderate correlation with the local FIR (cc = −0.585, p &lt; 0.05), and R ̅ has a strong positive correlation with e (cc = 0.862, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, multiple regression using &lt;σ&gt;, &lt;Φ&gt;, and R ̅ as explanatory variables has the highest correlation for ankle plantar flexion power (cc = 0.823, R^2 = 0.706) among isometric strength tests, which is related to the tibialis anterior muscle. Significance. The reason for the observed associations with local muscle quantity, quality, and strength is that &lt;σ&gt; reflects muscle fiber density characterized by high tissue conductivity, &lt;Φ&gt; reflects muscle quality related to cell membrane capacitance, structural integrity, and fat infiltration, and R ̅ reflects extracellular water and local edema, which are collectively considered to constitute muscle strength.",

While population genetics and phylogenetics have traditionally been used for studying these processes, advances in sequencing technology now enable us to incorporate comparative and pan-genomic approaches as well. Here we present a highly contiguous, chromosome-scale and haplotype-resolved genome assembly for the southern live oak, Quercus virginiana, the first reference genome for section Virentes, as part of the American Campus Tree Genomes (ACTG) program. Originating from a clone of Auburn University’s historic “Toomer’s Oak,” this assembly contributes to the pool of genomic resources for investigating recombination, haplotype variation, and structural genomic changes influencing hybridization potential in this clade and across Quercus. It also provides insights into the architecture of the putative centromeric regions within the genus. Alongside other oak references, the Q. virginiana genome will support research into the evolution and adaptation of the Quercus genus.",

    "Abstract": "Diverse climatic environments lead to distinct ecological conditions in different rice planting regions, resulting in a wide variety of Magnaporthe oryzae (rice blast fungus) populations that frequently adapt and vary to suit their specific ecological niches. Understanding the diversity of M. oryzae populations across different ecological planting zones is fundamental for controlling rice blast disease. This study systematically investigated the population structure, distribution of avirulence (Avr) genes, and pathogenicity of M. oryzae using 174 monosporic isolates collected in 2021 from three counties in Hunan Province: Xinhua, Longhui, and Liuyang. The results indicated that while the number of physiological races in the three locations was similar, the dominant physiological races differed significantly. Overall, the resistance gene Pikm exhibited the highest resistance frequency. Additionally, genes like Pik, Pikp, and Pizt showed good resistance against pathogen populations in some ecological zones. Resistance frequencies varied dramatically across different ecological environments, indicating differing practical value for specific resistance genes in different ecological regions. Representative isolates from each location were screened and used to test the resistance of locally main cultivated varieties. The results revealed significant differences in the proportion of varieties resistant to the pathogen populations from the three locations. These findings provide a data basis for resistance breeding and the rational distribution of rice varieties across different ecological regions in Hunan Province.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: In contrast to methadone, buprenorphine is susceptible to precipitated withdrawal complicated by fentanyl in the unregulated opioid supply. The objective of this study was to examine associations between drug supply characteristics and the prevalence of precipitated withdrawal. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a cohort study during 2023–2025 among people with a lifetime history of buprenorphine or methadone treatment currently using a drug checking program. Explanatory variables included drug supply, health care, and treatment characteristics. The primary outcome was a self-reported lifetime history of precipitated withdrawal during a buprenorphine induction. Binomial linear regression models were used to calculate prevalence ratios with 95% CIs. Results: Among 234 people, 64% were men, 67% were non-Hispanic white, 41 was the median age, 94% reported a history of fentanyl use, 92% had a history of methadone treatment, and 68% had a history of buprenorphine treatment. Among those with a history of buprenorphine treatment, 29% reported precipitated withdrawal during buprenorphine inductions, of which 67% occurred when starting via outpatient pathways. Buprenorphine-associated precipitated withdrawal was slightly higher among those with recent xylazine use compared with those without (32% vs 22%, prevalence ratio: 2.10, 95% CI: 0.94, 4.67). People with recent buprenorphine inductions commonly started without clinical or social support (63%) or used standard dosing (53%). Conclusions: Buprenorphine-associated precipitated withdrawal was commonly reported. Improved guidance and treatment approaches should be prioritized to minimize these complications, particularly in outpatient settings.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Listening fatigue seems to reduce the quality of life for people with hearing loss. However, it has mostly been measured with subjective questionnaires. The present study investigates neural oscillatory activity in the resting electroencephalogram as a marker of the development of listening fatigue. It was hypothesized that alpha and theta power and subjective fatigue would increase after, compared with before, a challenging listening task, and that alpha peak frequency would decrease post-task. Design: Before and after completing an approximately hour-long task of listening to speech-in-noise, resting electroencephalogram in eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions and subjective fatigue ratings were collected from older adults with age-appropriate hearing abilities and healthy cognitive status (n = 41; 29 female; mean age: 69.22 years; range 50 to 85). Paired t tests were used to analyze pre- to post-task changes, and correlations were used to explore relations among variables. Results: Subjective fatigue on a visual-analogue scale increased post-task, indicating that the listening task induced the experience of fatigue. Alpha power increased post-task, whether eyes were open or closed. By contrast, numerical trends for theta power to increase post-task were not significant. In addition, peak alpha frequency decreased post-task. Exploratory analyses indicated a relation of the post-task increases in subjective fatigue and alpha power with eyes closed, and a relation of age and hearing ability to the extent of post-task reduction in peak alpha frequency. Disaggregating results by sex indicated stronger, more consistent trends for women than for men, both for the main effects of time-on-task on alpha power and for relations between oscillatory power and subjective fatigue. Conclusions: Alpha power and peak alpha frequency appear to be promising objective markers of the development of mental fatigue induced by challenging listening tasks in older adults.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Current hearing conservation standards assume that changes in the pure-tone audiogram fully capture the effects of noise-induced hearing damage. However, recent data suggest that individuals who frequently experience acute hearing symptoms after noise exposure may suffer long-term increases in hearing difficulty, even when their pure-tone thresholds remain unchanged. It is unclear whether these increases in subjective hearing difficulties correspond to objective measures of hearing ability. This study explores (1) whether tone-in-noise detection is negatively impacted by a history of noise-induced temporary threshold shifts, (2) whether noise exposure history or the number of temporary threshold shifts after exposure is the better predictor of tone-in-noise detection, and (3) whether tone-in-noise detection provides insights into subjective hearing complaints independent of the audiogram. Design: Two experiments were conducted to measure 500-Hz tone-in-noise detection thresholds among service members (SMs). Audiometric data were collected from SMs in addition to questionnaires about perceived hearing difficulties, noise exposure history, and history of hearing symptoms following noise exposure. In Experiment 1, 4253 SMs completed a 33-trial Masking Level Difference test that measured detection thresholds for a 500-Hz homophasic tone presented in homophasic noise (the N 0 S 0 condition) and a 500 Hz antiphasic tone presented in homophasic noise (the N 0 S π condition). In Experiment 2, 17,658 SMs completed an 18-trial test measuring N 0 S π detection. Results from Experiment 2 were converted into N 0 S π detection thresholds equivalent to those in Experiment 1 using data from 3206 SMs who completed both tests. Linear models were then fit to the data to determine the effects of noise exposure history, symptoms experienced after exposure, and pure-tone audiometric thresholds on N 0 S 0 and N 0 S π detection. Linear models were also used to determine the degree to which post-exposure symptoms, pure-tone audiometric thresholds, and N 0 S π detection could predict self-reported hearing complaints. Results: Individuals who reported frequent hearing symptoms after noise exposure had substantially worse N 0 S 0 and N 0 S π detection thresholds than those without these symptoms, even after controlling for pure-tone audiometric thresholds. Group differences were smallest for individuals who had good hearing thresholds and increased systematically as hearing thresholds increased within the normal range. Noise exposure history also influenced N 0 S π thresholds, but had a smaller effect than that of post-exposure symptoms. Finally, combining N 0 S π and hearing thresholds explained roughly 50% more of the variance in hearing complaint scores than either factor alone. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with results from animal models showing that temporary changes in hearing thresholds are associated with hearing damage. The results suggest that some listeners experience chronic hearing damage from the same noise exposures that have no effect on other listeners. Such auditory damage seems to impact subjective hearing difficulty, as reported previously, and objective tone-in-noise detection, as observed here. Evidence from this and other studies justifies the addition of questions regarding temporary threshold shift history and hearing complaints into all annual hearing tests conducted in hearing conservation programs. Adding a measure of binaural tone-in-noise detection to the clinical battery administered to noise-exposed patients who report hearing difficulties despite normal audiograms is also recommended.",

    "Abstract": "Hypoglycemia is defined as low blood glucose levels. While it is uncommon in healthy adults, diabetics and other vulnerable patient populations remain at increased risk. The neuroglycopenic symptoms of hypoglycemia, such as dizziness, lethargy, loss of consciousness, etc., are well known. However, hypoglycemia has significant cardiovascular manifestations. During an acute hypoglycemic episode, sympathoadrenal activation causes increased epinephrine release. Epinephrine directly increases myocardial workload via stimulating β 1 adrenoreceptors; in vulnerable populations, increased cardiac stress may provoke ischemia and infarction. Additionally, epinephrine may induce hypokalemia via stimulating β 2 adrenoreceptors on various cells; electrolyte disturbances induce electrocardiogram changes, increasing the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. Endothelial dysfunction may also arise due to epinephrine-mediated adrenergic activation. This article reviews the current literature addressing pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria, and cardiovascular complications of hypoglycemia.",

    "Abstract": "Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Given the global burden, the potential role of micronutrients—particularly vitamins—in modifying cardiovascular risk has been a topic of intense investigation. This review synthesizes current evidence on the associations between various vitamins and cardiovascular health. It explores biological mechanisms, including antioxidant activity, endothelial function, lipid modulation, homocysteine metabolism, and vascular calcification. Vitamins D, C, E, K, and several B-complex vitamins are highlighted for their relevance. While observational data often support associations between deficiencies and adverse cardiovascular outcomes, large-scale randomized controlled trials have yielded mixed or null results, particularly regarding supplementation efficacy in primary or secondary prevention. Despite a high prevalence of supplement use in the United States, with over half of adults reporting intake, robust evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit remains limited. In some subgroups—such as individuals with hypertension, heart failure, or vitamin deficiencies—certain vitamins may offer modest benefits. However, indiscriminate supplementation has generally not been proven effective and, in some cases, may carry risks. The review emphasizes the need for targeted interventions, individualized assessment, and further high-quality research to clarify the role of vitamins in cardiovascular prevention and treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Multiple academic sites have reported that social isolation can pose a public health hazard, specifically premature cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease. This article reports on cardiovascular complications discovered by clinicians and public health researchers. In addition, there are reports that social isolation is associated with pulmonary disease, cancer, autoimmune disease, and even adverse outcomes during pregnancy. Social isolation has been a known factor for serious adverse outcomes in psychiatric circles since the time of Emil Kraepelin, Paul Eugen Bleuler, and Emile Durkheim before the 20th century. In the past, there have also been sporadic case reports from biologically oriented psychiatrists reporting severe medical conditions in these patients, mostly regarded as due to poor access to medical assessments of patients with social isolation. While still a valid pathway for the explanation of some findings, recently, there has been a great deal of interest in the discovery of pathophysiological mechanisms as causative of deadly outcomes in victims of social isolation. This is based on the robust association between social isolation and the development of premature cardiovascular disease. Using Scopus, PubMed, and the Bernard Becker Medical Library at Washington University, the authors reviewed articles from Europe, England, North America, and East Asia published within the past 2 years. Descriptions of pathophysiological mechanisms published in the past 20 years are included in this paper.",

    "Abstract": "Obesity and hypertension are interdependent chronic conditions that substantially elevate global cardiovascular risk. Rising obesity prevalence has led to a parallel increase in hypertension, driven by complex physiological disturbances that extend beyond excess body weight alone. This review synthesizes current evidence on the mechanisms linking adiposity to blood pressure elevation, emphasizing the roles of sympathetic nervous system overactivity, insulin resistance, renal sodium retention, and adipose-derived hormonal and inflammatory dysregulation. Particular attention is given to visceral adiposity, which exerts adverse vascular, renal, and metabolic effects that accelerate development of hypertension-mediated organ damage, including left ventricular hypertrophy, arterial stiffness, and early renal injury. The manuscript also evaluates therapeutic strategies for obesity-related hypertension. Lifestyle interventions—caloric restriction, structured physical activity, and behavioral therapy—remain the cornerstone of management, producing clinically meaningful reductions in body weight and blood pressure. However, sustained weight loss is difficult for many individuals, necessitating adjunctive approaches. Contemporary pharmacotherapies, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide, have demonstrated substantial benefits in both weight reduction and blood pressure control. For patients with severe obesity or inadequate response to medical therapy, metabolic and bariatric procedures offer the most durable outcomes, improving cardiometabolic profiles and reducing antihypertensive medication burden.",

    "Abstract": "Growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) form an endocrine axis with broad cardiovascular relevance because their receptors in cardiomyocytes and vascular cells link hormonal signaling to myocardial growth and performance, vascular tone, endothelial nitric oxide biology, and cardiometabolic risk. This review synthesizes mechanistic, clinical, and epidemiologic evidence to clarify cardiovascular effects across GH/IGF-1 deficiency and excess, and to highlight implications for therapeutic decision making. Key themes include receptor-driven pathways, imaging, and functional phenotyping that distinguishes a “small-heart” pattern with microvascular and endothelial dysfunction in adult GH deficiency from concentric remodeling, diastolic impairment, arrhythmias, and a stiffness/volume-expanded hemodynamic profile in acromegaly, and evidence that timely endocrine control or replacement can yield partial reverse remodeling while residual abnormalities may persist with longer disease duration. Clinically, the review emphasizes that cardiometabolic tradeoffs differ across GH-directed therapies, so biochemical control alone may not capture risk. Major gaps include heterogeneous cohorts, confounding by comorbidities and concurrent hormone replacement, variable endpoints, and limited event-driven prospective data, motivating standardized phenotyping, hard-outcome studies, and validation of IGF-system biomarkers for risk stratification and treatment selection.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (CA-VTE) is a leading, severe, and potentially life-threatening complication in patients with malignancy. Low–molecular-weight heparin has historically been the standard of care; however, direct oral anticoagulants, particularly direct factor Xa inhibitors, have emerged as effective alternatives. These agents offer the convenience of oral administration, predictable pharmacokinetics, elimination of routine laboratory monitoring, and improved adherence. Despite the expanding role of direct oral anticoagulants in CA-VTE management, concerns regarding bleeding risk—particularly in patients with gastrointestinal and genitourinary malignancies—remain central to clinical decision-making. In this narrative review, we evaluate the efficacy, safety, and clinical applicability of apixaban for the treatment and prophylaxis of CA-VTE. Current evidence from randomized controlled trials, including CARAVAGGIO and AMPLIFY, demonstrates that apixaban has noninferior efficacy compared with low–molecular-weight heparin and conventional anticoagulation strategies, with comparable or lower rates of recurrent venous thromboembolism. In addition, apixaban appears to have a favorable safety profile, with no statistically significant increase in major bleeding in selected cancer populations, including those without active gastrointestinal lesions. Apixaban’s pharmacokinetic properties, including limited renal clearance and stable drug exposure, further enhance its clinical utility in oncologic populations. However, evidence supporting apixaban use across all cancer subtypes remains limited and heterogeneous, highlighting the need for additional comparative and real-world studies.",

    "Abstract": "Formerly incarcerated individuals have poorer oral health and less frequent dental care utilization than the general population. However, prior work has overlooked the relationship between prior incarceration and disparities in dental insurance coverage. Using data from the Health and Retirement Study (n = 11,638), findings from multiple logistic regression analyses demonstrate that formerly incarcerated older adults are significantly less likely to have dental insurance coverage (odds ratio [OR] = 0.745, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.608, 0.912). After accounting for the income-to-poverty ratio, this association was no longer statistically significant. Analyses using the Karlson-Holm-Breen method demonstrated that approximately 45% of the association between prior incarceration and dental insurance is explained by the income-to-poverty ratio. These findings suggest the need for policies to expand affordable dental coverage for formerly incarcerated older adults.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To determine how certolizumab pegol (CZP) dose and dose adjustments influence CZP plasma trough levels to facilitate therapeutic drug monitoring of CZP. Methods: The effect of CZP dose and dose adjustments on CZP plasma trough levels was evaluated post hoc using longitudinal data from a 52-week randomized phase III trial (RAPID 1) and its open-label extension trial. Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis treated with methotrexate for ≥6 months were randomized to CZP 200 mg, 400 mg, or placebo every other week (EOW). Patients in the extension trial were initially treated with CZP 400 mg EOW, then reduced to 200 mg EOW after ≥6 months. Results: Of 982 randomized patients, 846 patients entered the open-label extension trial. Median (interquartile range) plasma CZP concentrations after 12 weeks of treatment were 21.3 mg/L (14.7, 27.7) in the 200-mg group and 38.3 mg/L (29.2, 63.8) in the 400-mg group and increased from 18.3 (12.4, 26.5) to 43.4 (26.8, 63.3) mg/L after dose escalation from 200 to 400 mg EOW. Following CZP dose reduction from 400 mg to 200 mg, median CZP levels decreased from 36.1 (24.9, 49.0) to 17.2 (11.5, 23.1) mg/L. Conclusions: CZP plasma concentrations were influenced by both dose and dose adjustment in a predictable manner, with median plasma levels twice as high in the 400-mg group than in the 200-mg group, with a 2-fold increase after the dose increase from 200 to 400 mg. This facilitates the development of algorithms for therapeutic drug monitoring of CZP.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The rise of nonfentanyl synthetic opioids such as brorphine highlights the dynamic evolution of illicit opioid markets and the persistent toxicological and public health risks they pose. Methods: Studies reporting the pharmacology, toxicology, and analytical detection of brorphine and its analogues were identified through systematic searches of PubMed and Scopus databases. Additional data from official international organizations' early-warning platforms were also included. Results: Brorphine acts as a potent μ-opioid receptor agonist with preclinical evidence of strong antinociceptive activity, respiratory depression, and abuse potential. Since 2019, it has been increasingly identified in forensic casework, frequently in combination with fentanyl or benzodiazepines, and implicated in multiple nonfatal and fatal intoxications. Structurally related analogues, including halogenated derivatives and “orphine-type” compounds, whose pharmacological properties and toxicological profiles are not well understood, have emerged. Although several liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry–based methods exist for brorphine detection, no validated analytical workflows or certified reference materials are currently available for its analogues, limiting comprehensive monitoring and biomonitoring capacity. Conclusions: The rapid spread of brorphine and its analogues underscores the ongoing transition from fentanyl derivatives toward novel nonfentanyl μ-opioid receptor agonists. These substances pose significant analytical and toxicological challenges and require increased international surveillance, improved laboratory capabilities, and coordinated public health responses to reduce their impact.",

Guided by Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory and the American Association of Colleges of Nursing Essentials Domain 10, this practice improvement project involved evaluation of a 40-minute guided meditation for Doctor of Nursing Practice students. The intervention included breath work, emotional grounding, and cognitive recentering. Using a pre-posttest design, 39 participants reported significantly reduced stress ( P &lt; .001) and increased relaxation ( P &lt; .001). Nearly all endorsed benefits to personal well-being and recommended future integration. Findings suggest experiential meditation fostered resilience and self-care, offering nurse educators a practical strategy to enhance student wellness, professional development, and workforce sustainability.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To compare the clinical outcome of patients electing to undergo the Cross Bracing Protocol (CBP) for ACL rupture with those choosing surgical stabilization. Design: Observational prospective cohort study with 2-year follow-up. Setting: Private subspecialist sports orthopedics and sports medicine practice. Patients: The 80 patients who both entered and completed the study were skeletally mature 16 to 40 years old, presenting with an acute noncontact isolated ACL rupture, taking part in pivoting sports and intent on returning to that activity. ACL rupture was diagnosed on both clinical assessment and MRI. Patients were fit for general anesthetic and free of significant medical conditions. Interventions: Group A (40 patients) underwent surgical stabilization, and group B (40 patients) followed the CBP. The groups were similar regarding the following independent variables: age, body mass index, gender, dominance of the injured knee, and posterior tibial slope ( P &gt; 0.05). Main outcome measures: Recurrent instability, incidence of meniscal tears, and the following patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs); Tegner Activity Scores; Knee Injury Osteoarthritis Outcome Score subscales of sport/recreation and knee-related quality of life; subjective International Knee Documentation Committee score; and Lysholm Knee Score. Results: Group B had significantly higher risk of recurrent instability (70% vs 2.5%, P &lt; 0.001), medial meniscal tear (62% vs 2.5%, P &lt; 0.001), and inferior performance on all PROMs ( P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The CBP is associated with an unacceptably high rate of recurrent instability when used to treat ACL ruptures in patients taking part in pivoting sports.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To investigate the relationship between injury factors, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (NSAID) use, and concussion outcomes. Design: Prospective cohort. Participants: Adolescents (N = 118) ≤14 days of concussion seen at a sports medicine center between November 2020 and May 2025. Independent Variable: Participants who reported ibuprofen and/or naproxen use were assigned to the “NSAID use” group, all others were assigned to the “No NSAID use” group. Main Outcome Measures: Symptom severity, medical history, and medication use information were collected. The development of persisting symptoms after concussion (symptoms &gt; 28 days, [PSaC]) was monitored via time to symptom resolution. Results: We enrolled 118 participants with concussion (15.4 ± 1.7 years, 54% female, 8.4 ± 3.1 days postinjury): 29 (25%) reported taking NSAIDs (n = 24 ibuprofen, n = 3 naproxen, n = 2 ibuprofen/naproxen) before their evaluation. Those who reported NSAID use were evaluated sooner (7.4 ± 2.8 vs 8.7 ± 3.2 days postinjury; P = 0.05), weighed less (57.2 ± 11.0 vs 63.5 ± 17.0 kg; P = 0.06), and had more severe symptoms (59.9 ± 32.6 vs 39.3 ± 22.2; P &lt; 0.001). More participants who reported NSAID use sustained a sport-related concussion (93% vs 73%; P = 0.02), and fewer participants who reported NSAID use started physical activity before evaluation (17% vs 39%; P = 0.03). Severe symptoms were associated with NSAID use (OR = 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-1.05). Non–sport-related injuries (OR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.91) and higher symptom severity (OR = 1.02; 95% CI = 1.00, 1.04) were associated with greater odds of PSaC, but NSAID use was not (OR = 0.62; 95% CI, 0.19-1.97). Conclusions: In adolescents, NSAID use was associated with more severe symptoms but not PSaC. To optimize clinical guidance, future research should further evaluate the role of NSAIDs in concussion recovery.",

    "Abstract": "Hypothesis significant: Cochlear implant (CI) insertion trauma, as evidenced by fracture of the osseous spiral lamina (OSL), is associated with localized “dead zones” and focal spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) loss. Background: Hearing and structure preservation approaches to CI insertion aim to minimize trauma and preserve residual SGNs. In cases of significant insertion trauma, peripheral axons running through the bony OSL inherently become damaged if the OSL is fractured. The current investigation sought to determine if the relative location of OSL fracture was associated with focal areas of SGN loss. Methods: Five adult ears from the Mass Eye and Ear Otopathology Laboratory were identified with OSL fractures. When available, contralateral ears were also analyzed for comparison. Digitized e-Slides were used to create 3D cochlear reconstructions, and a coordinate system relative to the round window allowed for % distance along Rosenthal canal (RC) assignment of SGNs and OSL fracture locations. Abrupt changes in SGN density, defined as a drop &gt;50% within a 5% segment along RC were used as criteria for a significant and focal SGN loss. Insertion trauma in the form of electrode translocation and spiral ligament (SL) perforation was also characterized. Results: OSL fracture lengths ranged from approximately 72 to 109 degrees about the modiolus, with a median fracture length of 75 degrees. Total SGN counts ranged from 16,810 to 22,260. Abrupt and focal drops of &gt;50% in SGN density occurred in all 5 temporal bones with OSL fracture. In 3 of the cases, there were areas of localized “dead zones” at or immediately adjacent to the OSL fracture site, whereas in the remaining 2 cases, drops were seen in various areas across the cochlea. The case with the longest fracture demonstrated nearly a complete loss of neurons apical to the deepest fracture location. Ears with OSL fractures demonstrate a higher number of “dead zones” than the contralateral ears used for comparison, with median values of 3 and 2, respectively. Cases with an OSL fracture, electrode translocation, and SL perforation demonstrated a notably higher number of “dead zones” (median = 3) as compared with ears with only 1 or 2 CI insertional trauma injuries (median = 2). Conclusion: In temporal bones from CI patients, OSL fractures explain some—but not all—of the abrupt SGN loss observed following traumatic CI insertions. Distinct regions of SGN density observed across the length of these cochlea indicate multifactorial processes likely contribute to relative SGN “dead zones.”",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is a condition with largely unknown etiology, though both vascular and genetic components have been implicated. The X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) gene, involved in DNA repair and oxidative stress response, has been linked to ischemic stroke and noise-induced hearing loss. This study aimed to investigate the association between XRCC1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SSNHL risk in Taiwan. Design: Prospective case-control study. Setting: Tertiary academic medical center. Materials and methods: A total of 276 patients with SSNHL and 293 healthy controls were enrolled. Three XRCC1 SNPs (rs1799782, rs25489, and rs25487) were genotyped using TaqMan assays. All SNPs were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Associations with SSNHL risk were analyzed under dominant and recessive models using multivariate logistic regression. Clinical predictors of recovery were also evaluated. Results: The TT genotype of XRCC1 rs1799782 was significantly associated with increased SSNHL risk compared with the CC genotype [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=2.005; 95% CI=1.13-3.62; P =0.0164]. This association persisted under the recessive model (TT vs. CC+CT) (aOR=1.983; 95% CI=1.15-3.49; P =0.0134). No significant associations were observed for rs25489 and rs25487. High-tone (aOR=6.42; P = 0.0043) and flat-type (aOR=4.12; P =0.0071) audiogram patterns and longer treatment delay were linked to unfavorable clinical outcomes. XRCC1 genotypes were not predictive of treatment response. Conclusions: The TT genotype of XRCC1 rs1799782 is significantly associated with increased SSNHL susceptibility in the Taiwanese population.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Auditory nerve monitoring through electrically evoked compound action potentials (eCAP) can be used to assess cochlear neural integrity during vestibular schwannoma (VS) resection. Herein, we report on 5 cochlear implant (CI) patients who underwent VS resection with present eCAP responses both intraoperatively and postoperatively. Patients either did not perceive any sound through their CI or rapidly adapted to electrical stimulation, suggesting that the presence of eCAP does not guarantee auditory nerve function in patients with VS resection. Patients: Five patients who underwent simultaneous VS translabyrinthine resection and cochlear implantation. Interventions: Simultaneous cochlear implantation and translabyrinthine microsurgical VS resection. Main outcome measure: Electrically evoked compound action potential. Results: All patients had eCAP responses present during their VS resection and for at least 50 days post-surgery. Three of the 5 patients did not perceive any sound with their cochlear implant. This shows that the presence of an eCAP alone does not guarantee a functional auditory nerve or auditory perception. The other 2 patients could hear non-speech sounds, but these sounds quickly became inaudible, indicating that their auditory nerve lacked the ability to integrate the electrical stimulus over time. Conclusions: The presence of an eCAP response does not guarantee auditory sensation through a CI. Although eCAP measurements provide insight into the function of the distal end of the nerve, it does not ascertain integrity or function of the larger auditory nerve pathway. Therefore, eCAPs should not be used in isolation to monitor auditory nerve function during VS resection.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To review the effects of perioperative steroid delivery on cochlear impedances in human patients. Data bases reviewed: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid, and Cochrane databases were reviewed from inception through March 2025. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) reporting guidelines were used. Studies comparing cochlear impedances among patients who underwent cochlear implantation either with or without perioperative steroids were included. Data were collected on method, timing, and dose of steroid administration and cochlear impedance in the perioperative period. Results: Twelve studies were included in the review, which described 4 different routes of steroid delivery: intratympanic (3), intracochlear (7), drug-eluting electrodes (1), and intravenous±oral steroids (1). Nine studies revealed a significant association between steroid use during at least one point in the perioperative period to include 2 intracochlear studies and the intravenous±oral steroids study. Intratympanic steroid delivery reduced impedances up to 6 months postoperatively, whereas intracochlear and drug-eluting electrodes had persistent reductions in impedance up to 1 year. There was significant heterogeneity in study outcomes that limited the ability to perform a meta-analysis. Conclusions: Based on studies meeting inclusion criteria, local delivery of steroids via intratympanic, intracochlear, and drug-eluting formulations appear to lower cochlear impedances for a variable duration postoperatively. Oral steroids do not appear to affect cochlear impedances postoperatively. More studies are necessary to further elucidate the relationship between steroids and cochlear impedance.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To compare predictive accuracy of 3-step theory of suicide (3ST) factor scores derived from natural language processing of Veterans Health Administration (VHA) clinical progress notes versus a model that underlies VHA’s Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health-Veterans Enhanced Treatment (REACH VET) program retrained to predict the combined outcome of suicide attempt or suicide death, and to compare characteristics of patients accurately predicted by both approaches. Background: As health systems incorporate risk prediction models to guide suicide prevention efforts, it is important to evaluate their predictive accuracy and to consider the benefits of different modeling approaches. Methods: A comparative cohort design in which both risk prediction approaches were evaluated for the same random sample (n=162,132) of VHA patients alive on May 1, 2018, who had clinical encounters during the 4 weeks before that date. Results: At the highest risks (top 1%–5%), the model based on REACH VET variables outperformed the 3ST approach in terms of positive predictive value and false-negative rate. Among patients who attempted or died by suicide, uniquely identified by the 3ST approach and not by the retrained REACH VET model, none had attempted suicide during the prior 6 months, emergency department visits during the prior month, discharges from mental health hospitalizations during the prior 12 months, or a diagnosis of bipolar disorder during the prior 24 months. Conclusions: Additional research is recommended to further prepare 3ST factor scores based on NLP of clinical progress notes for use in clinical decision-making.",

Advances in molecular testing have led to the identification of new hereditary syndromes and expanded our understanding of the genetic landscape of renal neoplasia. This review summarizes both well-established and recently described hereditary renal cancer syndromes, highlighting their clinical, pathologic, and molecular features. Emphases are placed on genotype-phenotype correlations and the relationship between germline and somatic alterations in tumors. Understanding these correlations is critical for diagnosis, risk assessment, surveillance, and management and underscores the importance of a high index of clinical suspicion for early detection to optimize patient outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Tumors resembling conventional, somatic-type malignancies arise infrequently (&lt;10%) in association with malignant, postpubertal-type testicular germ cell tumors, mainly at the metastatic sites (less frequently at primary), and often after treatment. Historically, the pathogenetic framework for these tumors, indeed their current classification and nomenclature under the WHO 5 th Edition, contemplated their arising from (malignant) postpubertal-type teratomatous components undergoing oncogenic changes homologous to conventional somatic malignancies of the relevant tissue lineages. Recent scholarship questions the specificity of their provenance to postpubertal-type teratoma, with strong evidence relating them also to postpubertal-type yolk sac tumor as well. In tandem, molecular studies support a close relationship to their associated postpubertal-type testicular germ cell tumor rather than identifying any of the known molecular drivers of the somatic-type malignancies they resemble. The histologic patterns observed include sarcoma-like tumors, carcinoma-like tumors, primitive-appearing embryonic-type neuroectodermal tumor, nephroblastoma-like tumors, neuroglial-like neoplasms, leukemia-like malignancies, and combined forms incorporating 2 or more of the foregoing. Although greater experience will be required to validate the changing conceptualization of their origin, from a management standpoint when seen at metastatic sites these somatic tumors-like neoplasms may be poorly responsive to cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens whereas when seen in the primary site they behave favorably. Surgical resection, if feasible, may provide the best chance for sure at metastatic sites.",

    "Abstract": "Over the last 2 to 3 decades, we have seen incremental movement from the “Rule of 10s” for pheochromocytomas, particularly those regarding tumor bilaterality, malignancy, and patterns of inheritance. The biology and prevalence of these tumors have not changed, but there has been a great deal of progress in terms of our understanding of tumor genetics, variable modes of acquiring of both pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL), and our approach to clinical management of these unpredictable neoplasias. Although these non-epithelial neuroendocrine tumors are rare, they are clinically significant due to their hormonal activity, association with hereditary syndromes, and biological potential. Their detection has increased in recent decades with improved biochemical testing and advanced imaging modalities, yet predicting clinical behavior continues to be a major challenge. Histologically, PPGL typically shows classic neuroendocrine architecture but may display morphologic diversity, occasionally mimicking other adrenal or paraganglionic tumors. Immunohistochemistry remains essential for diagnostic confirmation and as a surrogate for genetic alterations, offering valuable genotype-phenotype correlations. With increasing knowledge of tumor genetics, additional emphasis has been placed on histology-based risk-stratification for these lesions, particularly those prone to metastasis or multifocality, and the 2022 WHO endorses no individual risk-stratification system, as none seems to be of definitive merit over another. Instead, it promotes a comprehensive approach integrating morphologic, molecular, and clinical factors. Approximately 40% of PPGL harbor germline mutations, whereas somatic alterations account for additional subsets. Mutations in SDH x, VHL , RET , NF1 , and other susceptibility genes define molecular clusters with distinct signaling pathways and clinical behavior, underscoring the importance of multidisciplinary, lifelong management.",

    "Abstract": "A distinct type of pancreatic carcinoma (n=31; 6% of adenocarcinomas) is described, distinguished from conventional pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by: (1) solid/undifferentiated (sheet-like, stroma-poor) carcinomas lacking features of other entities (no osteoclasts, microsatellite stable, INI-1 retained, nonkeratinizing squamous &lt;30%), often admixed with ordinary PDAC; (2) radiology/gross showing central necrosis/demarcation mimicking nonductal neoplasms, not scirrhous like PDAC; (3) marked intratumoral heterogeneity with divergent patterns, including basal/squamoid (81%), solid sheets punctuated with megavacuoles (77%), clear cell (68%), mucoepidermoid-like (36%), sarcomatoid (36%), and occasional choriocarcinomatous or angiosarcomatous patterns, and some with carcinomatous vasculitis; (4) cellular anaplasia with pleomorphic giant cells (55%), multinucleated nonosteoclastic (32%), and rhabdoid-like (32%); (5) immunohistochemically (n=16) consistently showing a basal phenotype with common GATA6 loss/depletion and/or CK5/6, p40, or p63 expression; (6) molecular-genetic profile (n=13) showing altered frequencies: ARID1A (31% vs. 4%) and CDKN2A/p16 (92% vs. 30%) alterations, universal KRAS mutations with enrichment in KRAS G12D, frequent TP53, and lower SMAD4 loss (8% vs. 55%). Limited follow-up suggests comparable or more favorable outcomes. In conclusion, this is a distinct type of carcinoma in the pancreas that is prone to being misdiagnosed as nonductal/non-PDAC cancers. It is the first pancreatic carcinoma type in which a basal molecular phenotype can be indicated clinically by both imaging and histopathology, with major potential management implications (as it is also enriched in actionable targets like ARID1A). Recognition of this category is critical for cancer research, as it offers an invaluable group to study plasticity, stroma versatility, necrosis mechanisms, and the basal type in pancreatic cancer.",

Using multivariable logistic regression, the study explored the relationship between scene time and ROSC, adjusting for various clinical and demographic predictors, and validated the model with calibration plots and sensitivity analyses. Results: A total of 8467 cardiac arrest cases met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The most common EMS scene time was 10 to 30 minutes, and longer scene times were significantly associated with ROSC. ROSC was more likely with older age, public or health care arrest locations, and defibrillation use, while airway interventions and medications were associated with lower odds of ROSC. Conclusion: We found that younger children had shorter EMS scene times, while those who achieved ROSC had longer scene times. Further investigation is needed to clarify the underlying factors and their impact on survival and neurological outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To describe the youngest and second ever reported patient with real-time point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) visualization of motile Enterobius vermicularis within the appendix and to demonstrate how real-time intraluminal motion aids in distinguishing parasitic infestation from typical obstructive appendicitis. Methods: We present the clinical course, ultrasound findings, and management of a 23-month-old girl with acute intermittent abdominal pain. Results: POCUS revealed a dilated, noncompressible appendix containing multiple linear echogenic structures demonstrating serpiginous, independent motion—highly suggestive of E. vermicularis . Mild periappendiceal echogenicity suggested early acute appendicitis. The patient was successfully managed nonoperatively with albendazole and intravenous antibiotics, experiencing complete symptom resolution within 24 hours. This represents the youngest and second-ever reported patient in whom real-time sonographic visualization of live appendiceal parasites has been reported. Conclusions: True intraluminal motility is a critical sonographic discriminator of parasitic infestation and can fundamentally alter management decisions. In this case, early identification of E. vermicularis supported a safe, nonoperative strategy for early appendicitis. Incorporating POCUS early in the evaluation of atypical pediatric abdominal pain may prevent unnecessary surgical intervention.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Early prediction of remnant liver growth after portal vein embolization (PVE) would enable earlier surgery in patients with resectable liver malignancy, decreasing the risk of tumor progression. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of 4D flow MRI to detect changes in portal blood flow before and after PVE and determine whether 4D flow MRI can predict hypertrophy of nonembolized liver lobes (future liver remnant) in a porcine model. Methods: Thirteen juvenile pigs were included in this prospective study. In 11 pigs, 2 of the 4 portal vein branches were selectively embolized using polyvinyl alcohol particles. Two pigs served as controls. All animals were imaged before, 1 hour, and 1 and 2 weeks after PVE using 4D flow and T1-weighted 3D spoiled gradient-echo MRI. Flow measurements were correlated with liver volumetry measurements. The predictive value of flow changes immediately after PVE for future liver remnant hypertrophy at 2 weeks was estimated using linear mixed-effect model analysis. Results: Twelve pigs completed the study. One treatment pig died from complications of anesthesia. Immediately after PVE, relative flow in the 2 embolized portal vein branches decreased from 17.0±2.1% to 3.4±2.1% of total portal flow, respectively. Relative flow increased from 16.6±3.8% to 32.6±3.8% in the remaining 2 nonembolized portal vein branches supplying the future liver remnant. Each 1% increase in relative blood flow directly after the procedure predicted a 4.8±0.7 cm 3 (estimate±SE) increase in volume of the future liver remnant at 2 weeks ( P &lt;0.0001). Conversely, in embolized lobes, each 1% flow decrease predicted a volume reduction of 3.4±1.0 cm 3 ( P =0.003). Conclusion: 4D flow MRI successfully quantified portal blood flow before and after portal vein embolization in a porcine model. Notably, immediate postembolization changes in portal flow were predictive of lobar volume changes observed at 2 weeks. This porcine model thus provides a valuable platform for investigating the relationship between portal hemodynamics and hypertrophy of the future liver remnant. Furthermore, it will enable systematic evaluation of various embolization agents and techniques, supporting the refinement of interventional strategies in hepatic regenerative research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) shares genetic features with psoriasis (PsO), with HLA-Cw6 being the main risk allele that may shape its clinical phenotype. This study aimed to evaluate the association between HLA-Cw6 status and clinical features, comorbidities, and treatment outcomes in PsA. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 426 patients with PsA who fulfilled the CASPAR criteria and had documented HLA-Cw6 status. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment-related variables were extracted from medical records. Patients were compared according to HLA-Cw6 positivity using descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. Results: HLA-Cw6 was present in 24.6% of the patients. HLA-Cw6–positive individuals were more frequently female (65.7% vs. 46.1%, P =0.001) and showed earlier PsO onset (28.0 vs. 35.3 y, P =0.009) and longer PsO-arthritis latency (17 vs. 9 y, P =0.024). Dactylitis was significantly less common in HLA-Cw6–positive patients (25.7% vs. 38.0%, P =0.022). HLA-Cw6-positive patients received more targeted therapies (1.8 vs. 1.5 drug classes, P =0.014) and had shorter TNFi persistence (17 vs. 36 mo, P =0.044). IL-12/23 inhibitors showed longer persistence in this group, although the difference was not statistically significant. In multivariate models, HLA-Cw6 was independently associated with female sex (OR: 4.11, P =0.003), lower frequency of dactylitis (OR: 0.33, P =0.020), and greater odds of difficult-to-manage PsA (OR: 12.53, P =0.001) and treatment-refractory PsA (OR: 15.39, P =0.001) based on recent EULAR definitions. Conclusions: HLA-Cw6 identifies a PsA subset with distinctive clinical features and increased therapeutic complexity. These findings support the potential of HLA-Cw6 as a biomarker for PsA characterization and individualized therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Given the limited discussion of race among Asian (Americans) in both mainstream and DLBE classrooms, and the pressing need to facilitate children’s critical racial consciousness, the authors worked with two bilingual teachers in a Mandarin-English DLBE program to co-design an innovative anti-racist biliteracy curriculum integrating Asian (American) histories and lived experiences to disrupt the dominant discourse of anti-Asian and foster senses of critical racial consciousness and multiracial solidarity within the school. In this paper, the authors aims to answer the following research question: How do Asian (American) students in a fifth-grade Dual Language Bilingual Education (DLBE) Chinese/English classroom negotiate their understanding of racism and anti-Asian discourse through literacy engagement with racially-conscious children’s literature and texts? Design/methodology/approach This study uses a participatory method within an AsianCrit-informed translanguaging theoretical framework to explore the development of critical consciousness and multiracial solidarity in a 5th grade DLBE Chinese/English program through a researcher-teacher co-designed Asian (American) anti-racist biliteracy lesson incorporating Asian (American) children’s literature and lived experiences. Findings The findings reveal that students demonstrated (1) an enhanced ability to confront Asian (American) oppressions and white supremacy, (2) increased recognition of racism beyond Black/white binary and (3) the emergent critical racial consciousness. These findings suggest that intentional integration of Asian (American) racially conscious content in DLBE programs can serve as an effective means of promoting critical consciousness of race and fostering interracial understanding among emerging bilinguals. This study contributes to the growing body of research on critical pedagogy in bilingual education and offers practical insights for educators seeking to cultivate anti-racist awareness in diverse classroom settings. Research limitations/implications While this study focused on a single classroom and focal text, its implications are broader. It offers a replicable model for integrating translanguaging and AsianCrit-informed curriculum into DLBE programs that too often sideline Asian (American) histories and racial justice concerns. By reimagining DLBE not just as a linguistic space but as a space for equity and transformation, this work contributes to the growing movement toward justice-centered bilingual education. Practical implications The learners in this study gradually developed an emerging activist stance as they reflected on historical and contemporary racial injustices, demonstrating that critical consciousness is not beyond the grasp of elementary-aged children. However, cultivating this consciousness should not be a “hit-and-run” effort isolated to language arts. To sustain this work, DLBE programs must take a program-wide approach, infusing criticality across disciplines and ensuring that discussions of race, power and identity are not relegated to isolated lessons. This includes providing sustained professional development, fostering collaborative curriculum planning and creating structural support for teachers navigating sociopolitical tensions around race and language. Social implications Framed through the lens of AsianCrit and translanguaging, this study also addresses how educators and policymakers can better meet the unique educational needs of Asian (American) students in a post-pandemic context marked by rising anti-Asian racism. While Chinese-English DLBE programs have grown rapidly in the USA (Lee, 2009; Mandarin Immersion Parents Council, 2026), they are often shaped by neoliberal logics that frame Mandarin as an elite language and marginalize Chinese American voices. This study disrupts such tendencies by demonstrating that DLBE classrooms – when grounded in anti-racist, culturally sustaining pedagogy – can be transformative sites for identity affirmation and cross-racial coalition-building. Originality/value This study offers timely insights into how a biliteracy curriculum that centers Asian (American) histories and voices can cultivate critical racial consciousness among students of Color in Chinese–English DLBE programs. In response to growing calls to move beyond traditional DLBE goals of bilingualism, biliteracy and cross-cultural competence (Howard et al., 2018; Cervantes-Soon et al., 2017; Palmer et al., 2019), the findings highlight how young multilingual students can engage in complex racial analysis and empathy-building when provided with identity-affirming texts and critical pedagogical guidance.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to introduce Nuwa, a robust fuzzing framework for testing real-world Windows applications (UWP, WinUI2, WinUI3 and Win32), addressing challenges like multi-process architectures and complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that hinder existing tools. Design/methodology/approach Nuwa integrates: a lightweight instrumentation module using WinDbg C++ API for code coverage; a scheduling algorithm prioritizing inputs based on coverage feedback; and an automated interaction layer leveraging Windows automation APIs for GUI manipulation with malformed inputs. The instrumentation module provides real-time coverage feedback, which is used by the scheduling algorithm to prioritize inputs that are more likely to trigger new code paths. The automated interaction module ensures that these inputs can be delivered to the application, even when complex GUI interactions are required. Findings Testing on Siemens Solid Edge Free Viewer and Windows Media Player (UWP) revealed critical vulnerabilities, including out-of-bound writes, reads and zero day. Siemens yielded 9 CVEs (CVE-2023–39181 to CVE-2023–39186, CVE-2024–47941, CVE-2024–47940 and CVE-2024–54091), while Media Player had 3 undisclosed zero day (2 AVI, 1 MOV parsing), impacting millions of devices and causing Windows Explorer crashes. Experiments show Nuwa also outperforms WinAFL in both DynamoRIO and Intel-PT modes in metrics including compatibility, fuzzing throughput and coverage. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, Nuwa is the first coverage-guided fuzzing framework for real-world Windows apps, combining efficient instrumentation, smart scheduling and automated GUI interaction to fill a critical gap in fuzzing tools.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to address the challenges of dynamic and web-oriented network resource provisioning in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), where the diversity and complexity of in-vehicle web services require efficient and adaptive resource scheduling. It proposes a dual-time-scale strategy to enhance resource allocation, reduce service scheduling delays and ensure load balancing across network slices. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a dual-time-scale approach for network slicing resource prediction and dynamic scheduling. At the long-time scale, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network is employed to learn temporal patterns of vehicle behavior and web service requests, enabling accurate load prediction and proactive resource preconfiguration. At the short-time scale, a dueling double deep Q-network (D3QN) algorithm performs fine-grained resource scheduling based on real-time service states, ensuring compliance with service level agreements. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the strategy’s performance in terms of scheduling latency, system utility and load balancing. Findings Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM-D3QN strategy maintains high system utility saturation while significantly reducing web service scheduling latency during peak periods. It also effectively ensures load balancing among slices. Compared to baseline algorithms, the method achieves an average reduction in service scheduling delay by 54.57%, an improvement in utility saturation by 22.41% and a decrease in slice load by 23.46% across three typical service slices. Originality/value This paper introduces a novel dual-time-scale framework that integrates LSTM-based load prediction with D3QN-based real-time scheduling for web-oriented IoV environments. By jointly optimizing long-term resource preallocation and short-term dynamic adjustment, the approach enhances adaptability and robustness in dynamic service provisioning. The study provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges of heterogeneous web service demands in IoV, offering significant practical and theoretical insights for future network slicing and resource management research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine and better understand how tax avoidance practices affect dividend payout policy, particularly in family-owned firms. Design/methodology/approach The sample includes 3,732 firm-year observations of 311 French firms from 2011 to 2022. The authors use panel data regression based on the Prais−Winsten regression to examine how tax avoidance affects dividend payout. Findings The results show that tax avoidance is positively associated with dividend payout policies. More importantly, the authors find that family ownership exacerbates this positive relationship. These results suggest that family firms may be more inclined to channel tax savings directly into dividend distributions to benefit family shareholders and signal the firm’s financial health and stability to investors. Research limitations/implications This study examines only the French context, which restricts the generalizability of the results. Practical implications The findings provide important insights for investors and policymakers. Investors in family-owned firms should be aware of their tendency to distribute tax savings as dividends rather than reinvest them. Policymakers might encourage firms to reinvest savings in innovation or growth initiatives to promote more balanced economic benefits. Originality/value This study builds upon prior research by investigating how family-owned firms’ specific behaviors influence the link between tax avoidance and dividend policy.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study examines the adoption, effectiveness and challenges of AI (Artificial Intelligence) and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies to improve energy efficiency in student housing, with a focus on comparing regions in the Global North and Global South. Design/methodology/approach The research is based on a systematic review of 42 peer-reviewed articles published between 2020 and 2025. Of these, 28 studies on the Global North and 14 on the Global South met the criteria. The review highlights patterns in energy savings, its scope and usage, and the challenges encountered during implementation. Findings Adoption rates of AI and IoT in student housing are notably higher in the Global North than in the South. The findings show that the Global South has below 30% influence due to cost, infrastructure and digital literacy constraints. AI models consistently demonstrated effectiveness, with predictive accuracies between 85% and 95% and IoT energy savings of 15%–30%. The Global South witnessed technical integration challenges, long-term maintenance and behavioural resistance. High upfront costs, an unreliable power supply, together with insufficient institutional expertise, posed challenges for the Global South. Practical implications These findings require more inclusive AI and IoT energy systems tailored to different regions.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to investigate an actively configured communication system to resolve the communication issues within heterogeneous multi-robot systems performing collaborative tasks. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes an actively configured communication system for heterogeneous multi-robot cooperative control featuring a rationally communication framework, integrated communication nodes and an actively configured control algorithm to ensure robustness in dynamic environments. The communication framework underpins cooperative control. To address consistency issues in communication, positioning and control functions across heterogeneous multi-robot systems, an integrated communication node has been developed that combines communication, positioning and computation functionalities. Furthermore, considering the connectivity of the system’s communication, this paper incorporates communication constraints into cooperative control based on the proposed communication node, leading to the development of an actively configured control algorithm. Findings The proposed actively configured communication system has been deployed across various robot platforms to build a heterogeneous multi-robot cooperative control system. The functionalities of the communication system are validated in real-world scenarios through cooperative formation and exploration experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed heterogeneous multi-robot communication system is both stable and effective. Originality/value The communication system studied in this paper can effectively address the issue of communication consistency in heterogeneous multi-robot cooperative control tasks, especially for distributed environments requiring various cooperative tasks.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to examine the impact of channel integration on consumer experience in omni-channel banking, with a particular focus on the moderating role of customer empowerment. It further investigates how enhanced consumer experience translates into key relational outcomes. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through survey responses from 300 banking customers, capturing perceptions of channel integration, customer empowerment and overall consumer experience. Structural equation modeling was used to test the proposed relationships. Findings The results demonstrate that channel integration significantly enhances consumer experience in omni-channel banking. More importantly, customer empowerment was found to significantly strengthen the impact of channel integration on consumer experience, highlighting its critical moderating role. Enhanced consumer experience subsequently leads to higher customer satisfaction, increased repurchase intentions and positive word-of-mouth. Practical implications The findings suggest that banks should not only prioritize seamless channel integration but also actively empower customers through greater control, transparency and personalization. Such empowerment amplifies the benefits of channel integration, enabling banks to strengthen customer relationships and achieve superior relational and performance outcomes. Originality/value This study makes a novel contribution by being among the first to empirically validate customer empowerment as a key boundary condition in the relationship between channel integration and consumer experience within omni-channel banking. By extending Relationship Marketing Theory to digital and omni-channel contexts, the findings offer new theoretical insights into how empowered customers cocreate value through integrated service channels.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine how the career expectations of Generation Z are reshaping organizational structures, talent management practices and the strategic role of human resource leadership. Rather than treating Gen Z preferences as short-term generational adjustments, this study positions them as signals of deeper organizational transformation necessary for long-term workforce sustainability and competitiveness. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a conceptual and integrative approach, drawing on recent global surveys, practitioner reports and academic literature on Generation Z, organizational design and strategic human resource management. Findings The analysis finds that Gen Z career expectations challenge traditional assumptions around tenure, hierarchical progression, presenteeism and transactional employment relationships. Organizations that respond through structural redesign rather than policy-level adjustments are more likely to achieve sustained employee engagement and retention. Practical implications For practitioners, this study highlights the need to reposition human resource as a strategic partner in organizational design rather than a functional administrator. It offers insight into how flexibility, career progression and well-being can be operationalized at the structural level, while cautioning against superficial compliance-driven responses that undermine organizational credibility among Gen Z employees. Originality/value This study adds value by shifting the discussion on Generation Z from preference mapping to strategic organizational transformation. It integrates multiple dimensions of Gen Z expectations into a coherent framework for organizational redesign, offering a perspective that moves beyond generational stereotypes and positions Gen Z as a catalyst for modernizing work systems.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Lead (Pb)-free solder alloys are increasingly adopted in microelectronic packaging due to their environmental compliance and favorable mechanical performance. This study aims to investigate the effect of thermal aging on the mechanical behavior of Sn98.5-Ag1.0-Cu0.5 (SAC105) solder alloy doped with indium (1, 2 and 3 Wt.%) to enhance reliability in high-temperature electronic applications. Design/methodology/approach Specimens were fabricated via die casting and thermally aged at 125°C and 180°C for 72 h. Mechanical properties, including yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS), were evaluated using a universal testing machine. Microstructural evolution was examined through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and elemental composition was confirmed via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Findings As-cast alloys with 1–3 Wt.% In exhibited progressive improvements in YS and UTS, with the 3 Wt.% In composition reaching 46 and 52.62 MPa, respectively – a 72% increase over base SAC105. This enhancement is attributed to solid solution strengthening and microstructural refinement. Although thermal aging led to strength degradation, indium-containing alloys retained superior integrity. Notably, the SAC105 + 3 Wt.% In alloy maintained a UTS of 44.75 MPa after aging at 180°C. SEM analysis revealed uniform indium distribution and formation of Cu6(Sn,In)5 and Ag3(Sn,In) intermetallic compounds. Practical implications Indium doping offers a cost-effective strategy towards sustainable and high reliability solder materials for automotive and aerospace electronics, with potential to reduce lead dependence in compliance with RoHD directives. Originality/value This work provides novel insights into indium’s role in reinforcing SAC105 solder alloys, supporting the development of sustainable, high-performance lead-free solders for thermally demanding applications.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims There is significant concern about potential rising harms from gamma‐hydroxybutyrate (GHB) but an absence of studies internationally synthesising data across indicators to identify changes in harms and broader patterns of use. This paper contributes to addressing this gap by measuring national trends in GHB use, harms and treatment in Australia. Design, setting, and cases Triangulation of indicators (2013–2024) from Australian triennial population surveys; annual interviews with cross‐sectional non‐representative samples of people who use illicit stimulants or who inject drugs; and administrative data on GHB‐related hospitalisations, GHB‐related deaths, and treatment episodes where GHB was the principal drug of concern. Measurements Annual trend data were analysed using Joinpoint regression. Survey data were modelled as the annual percent change in the proportion reporting lifetime, past 12‐month, and past 6‐month use, depending on the survey. Administrative data were modelled as the annual percent change in crude rates per 100 000 population. Findings Lifetime and past 12‐month GHB use in the general population remained below 1.2% and 0.2% respectively, but the latter increased from 0.07% in 2013 to 0.19% in 2022–2023 (annual percent change [APC] 9.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.2, 13.2). The percentage of people who use illicit stimulants reporting past 6‐month use increased from 5.7% in 2013 to 7.3% in 2017 (APC 11.6; 95%CI: 0.2, 52.9) and from 5.4% in 2019 to 11.5% in 2024 (APC 17.8; 95%CI: 5.9, 41.1). The proportion of people who inject drugs reporting use varied between 7.2% and 17.5% over the short period studied (2020–2024). There were statistically significant increases in GHB‐related hospitalisations from 5.3 in 2012–13 to 19.1 per 100 000 people in 2022–23 (APC 19.0; 95%CI: 11.9, 31.1) and GHB‐related deaths from 0.02 in 2013 to 0.24 per 100 000 people in 2022 (APC 36.5; 95%CI: 27.2, 58.1). Treatment episodes also increased across the period, from 0.07 in 2012–13 to 6.0 episodes per 100 000 people in 2020–21 (APC 97.3; 95%CI: 83.5, 830.9), with no subsequent statistically significant change (8.4 per 100 000 people in 2022–23). Conclusions Gamma‐hydroxybutyrate use, harms and treatment engagement increased in Australia from 2013 to 2024. These findings highlight a need to implement acceptable, tailored prevention and harm reduction strategies for key populations, and implement stronger monitoring efforts nationally and internationally.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Although adalimumab has shown strong efficacy and safety in clinical trials, real‐world evidence in Australian patients with moderate‐to‐severe chronic plaque psoriasis is limited. This study assessed adalimumab efficacy and drug survival in routine clinical practice, comparing outcomes with the Phase 3 REVEAL trial and its open‐label extension. Methods Data were extracted from the Australasian Psoriasis Registry for adults meeting Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme criteria to be prescribed adalimumab for chronic plaque psoriasis. Baseline demographics, Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) scores and treatment history between June 2006 and March 2022 were analysed. Drug survival was evaluated using Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression. Results A total of 306 patients were included; 59.8% had prior biologic exposure compared to 12.8% in REVEAL. The mean baseline PASI was 24.1 and at 3 months, 63.5% achieved PASI75 while 33.6% achieved PASI90. PASI90 responses remained stable through 3 years and exceeded REVEAL extension rates beyond 18 months. Median drug survival was 27.9 months; survival was 97.7%, 78.6%, 63.7% and 51.0% at 3, 9, 15 and 27 months, respectively. Male sex and achieving PASI ≤ 2 predicted longer drug survival. Conclusions In Australian real‐world practice, adalimumab demonstrated sustained effectiveness and drug survival in patients with chronic plaque psoriasis comparable to RCTs, despite higher baseline disease severity and greater prior biologic exposure.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background IgE‐associated allergic diseases, affecting approximately 30% of the global population, are a major health burden. Standard treatments, including pharmacotherapy and allergen immunotherapy (AIT), have limitations such as adverse effects, insufficient symptom relief and long treatment durations. Methods In this study, we developed and evaluated a bispecific T‐cell engager (TCE) and a half‐life extended (HLE) bispecific natural killer (NK) cell engager (NKCE) targeting IgE‐producing cells, to offer novel, potentially curative therapeutic options. The TCE and HLE‐NKCE constructs were designed to target the CεmX domain of membrane‐bound IgE (mIgE) and engage T cells and NK cells, respectively. Their efficacy was assessed through in vitro luciferase‐based cytotoxicity assays using Ramos and U266 B‐cell lines expressing mIgE as target cells, and primary human immune effector cells and the NK‐cell line NK‐92 as effector cells. Additional characterisation of the constructs was performed using flow cytometry. Results Both TCE and HLE‐NKCE specifically mediated killing of CεmX‐expressing cells in a dose‐ and effector‐to‐target (E:T) ratio‐dependent manner. The TCE demonstrated robust activity even at low antigen densities and concentrations as low as 1 ng/mL (18 pM). The HLE‐NKCE effectively mediated killing in the presence of human serum albumin, suggesting functionality in physiological conditions. T‐ and NK‐cell activation was observed only in the presence of target cells and TCE. Conclusion Our novel anti‐CεmX TCE and HLE‐NKCE effectively target and eliminate mIgE‐expressing cells in vitro. Although further investigation is needed, our bispecific engagers are promising off‐the‐shelf therapeutics for the treatment of IgE‐associated allergic diseases.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective To assess the adherence of glaucoma surgical and laser studies to WGA guidelines for reporting glaucoma surgery studies, analyse trends in adherence over time and explore associations between adherence and study characteristics. Methods Systematic review (PROSPERO:CRD42023394477) of glaucoma surgical and laser studies published between 2010 and 2023 in PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE. Eligible studies included RCTs, non‐randomized comparative and prospective observational designs (&gt;100 eyes). Two reviewers independently extracted data across five domains: Methodology , Definition of success , Ethics , Postoperative complications and Statistical reporting . Temporal trends and associations with study features were analysed using linear regression. Results Two hundred and fifty‐six studies were included, 75% of which were published in Q1–Q3 journals. Mean overall adherence was 47% ± 9.2%. Domain‐level adherence was highest in Ethics (61% ± 20%), followed by Postoperative complications (50% ± 22%), Statistical reporting (48% ± 18%), Methodology (44% ± 12%) and Definition of success (30% ± 13%). No significant differences ( p &gt; 0.06) were observed in overall adherence for studies from Europe, Asia, Oceania or the Middle East. Studies involving cataract surgery for angle‐closure disease (est. = −10% [−19%, −2.2%], p = 0.014) and laser trabeculoplasty (est. = −7.1% [−11%, −3.5%], p &lt; 0.001) had lower adherence compared with trabeculectomy, while MIGS studies showed no difference ( p = 0.45). Visual field progression was reported in only 3% of studies, while various anatomical outcomes (e.g. bleb morphology) were reported in 0%–24% of studies. Conclusion Current literature shows poor adherence to WGA guidelines across both traditional and newer glaucoma surgeries, reflecting inadequate reporting and outdated recommendations. Evidence‐based updates, broader consensus and stronger implementation are needed to ensure standardized and meaningful reporting.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In recent decades, geography has increasingly engaged with questions of positionality, power relations, and the situatedness of knowledge production. Feminist, postcolonial, and transdisciplinary approaches, in particular, have therefore emphasised the need for continuous reflection throughout the research process. However, there is currently no established ethical procedure and infrastructure in geography that systematically supports this insight. In this conceptual paper, we argue for establishing an ethics committee in geography that moves beyond a singular, formal judgment, and approval at the outset of a research project. Instead, we propose a process‐oriented ethics approach that engages with ethical questions continuously throughout the research process. Such ethical practice would provide ongoing support and empowerment for researchers, addressing ethical challenges at different stages of the research process. This includes issues of participation, the handling of sensitive data, the representation of marginalised groups, power asymmetries between researchers and research participants, and the publication process. We claim that process‐oriented ethics approaches both enhance the quality of geographical research and strengthen the discipline's responsibility. In this paper, we present an ethics framework to inspire and stimulate a debate about process‐oriented ethics in geography (POEG).",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Aims Adipose tissue insulin resistance, reflecting impaired insulin‐mediated suppression of lipolysis in adipose tissue, is recognized as an early metabolic abnormality. However, its associations with fasting blood glucose (FBG) and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) have not been well characterized in adults without diabetes. The study aims to evaluate these associations under conditions of normoglycaemia and prediabetes. Materials and Methods The study enrolled 9011 adults without diabetes. Adipose tissue insulin resistance index (Adipo‐IR) was calculated by the product of fasting insulin and free fatty acid levels. We categorized FBGand HbA1c separately into three groups. We conducted logistic regression after adjustment for potential confounders. Results Adipo‐IR gradually increased with the increase of FBG categories and HbA1c categories. The positive association between Adipo‐IR and FBG levels varied by body mass index (BMI) ( p for interaction &lt;0.001), with a strengthened relationship in the condition of BMI &lt;24 kg/m 2 . One unit increase in log‐Adipo‐IR was associated with 2.74 (95% CI: 2.02, 3.73, p &lt; 0.001) times odds of having high FBG levels (denoted as FBG ≥5.6 mmol/L) after adjustment for other risk factors in participants with BMI &lt;24 kg/m 2 . However, the ORs turned out to be 1.67 (95% CI: 1.36, 2.07, p &lt; 0.001) and 1.30 (95% CI: 0.98, 1.74, p = 0.07) in participants with BMI 24 to &lt;28 and ≥28 kg/m 2 , respectively. The positive associations between Adipo‐IR and HbA1c levels were also observed among participants with body mass index &lt;24, 24 to &lt;28, and ≥28 kg/m 2 , and among females and males, respectively. Conclusions Adipose tissue insulin resistance demonstrated a significant dose–response relationship with both FBG and HbA1c levels in individuals without diabetes, which may reflect early glycaemic alterations. The association between Adipo‐IR and FBG was more pronounced under conditions of normal or low body weight.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Recent understanding of pulp biology has shifted treatment paradigms toward preservation‐based approaches. Traditional diagnostic terminology and treatment protocols require updating to align with current evidence supporting the pulp's healing capacity. Aim Sixteen international specialists in pediatric dentistry and endodontics convened at the 3rd IAPD Summit in Porto, Portugal (November 2024) to develop consensus‐based recommendations on pulp therapies in primary and permanent teeth. Methods Following a structured three‐phase approach, experts conducted systematic literature reviews and participated in Delphi surveys using a 7‐point Likert scale. Recommendations achieving &gt; 70% consensus were categorized as strong (based on RCTs/systematic reviews), conditional (observational studies), or consensus‐based statements (expert opinion). Results Thirty‐eight evidence‐based recommendations were developed across four key areas: pulp inflammation and diagnosis, caries excavation, management of pulpitis in primary and permanent teeth, and traumatic dental injuries. Key findings emphasized selective caries removal over complete excavation, calcium silicate cements as preferred materials for vital pulp therapy, and conservative approaches for managing irreversible pulpitis. Decision trees were created to support clinical implementation. Conclusions These consensus recommendations provide evidence‐based guidance for managing pulpal diseases using minimally invasive, biologically driven tiered approaches that prioritize pulp preservation in both primary and permanent teeth.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Organisations implementing change initiatives routinely fail to maintain alignment between strategic intent and daily operations, detect emerging issues early or build sustainable data habits for continuous improvement. This paper examines how organisations can address these challenges through high frequency, data‐driven feedback systems that operate at the pace of organisational change. We analyse how OTTO, one of Europe's leading retailers, transformed from Germany's largest catalogue retailer into a digital marketplace platform. Central to managing this change was their Digital Heartbeat, a continuous feedback system that captured employee perspectives through 12‐week measurement cycles. Through three empirical episodes of change, we demonstrate how this approach maintained continuous alignment during software development, enabled rapid detection of training freeze impacts, and allowed differential recovery rates in customer service. Based on this analysis, we provide nine recommendations organised across three implementation phases: designing the approach, implementing it at scale and using the feedback loop to steer change. Our recommendations offer concrete, actionable guidance to executives and senior leaders, middle managers and change leaders. The approach scales from hundreds to thousands of employees, with adaptations for regulated industries and sectors with longer operational cycles. We conclude with boundary conditions for practitioners determining whether and how to implement data‐driven feedback for managing organisational change.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Being moved, also known as kama muta , is an emotion associated with warmth and social connectedness. Although theoretical accounts posit that it may contribute to the development and maintenance of romantic relationships by fostering intimacy, affirming commitment, and reinforcing shared values, empirical research remains limited. To address this gap, we conducted three studies. Study I explored the situational effects of recalling touching events on relationship satisfaction. Building on this, Study II examined whether proneness to being moved is associated with relationship satisfaction, and additionally tested intimacy and closeness as potential mediators, and attachment styles as potential moderators of this link. Study III refined this approach by employing a relationship‐specific measure of being moved to assess whether the observed effects generalize when measured within the romantic domain. Study I demonstrated that recalling touching events enhanced satisfaction, particularly among less satisfied individuals. Study II revealed that dispositional being moved was positively associated with satisfaction via intimacy and closeness, and that avoidant attachment attenuated these effects. Study III confirmed these results using the refined measure. Across three studies, being moved emerged as a relational emotion that promotes intimacy and closeness, thereby contributing to relationship satisfaction. By linking situational experiences, dispositional tendencies, and relationship‐specific measurement, this research provided preliminary indications of the potential role of kama muta in sustaining romantic bonds.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Cell and gene therapies (CGTs) represent a paradigm shift in modern medicine, offering targeted and potentially curative options for complex and rare diseases. Their integration into health‐system pharmacy practice requires alignment with the medication‐use process to ensure safety, efficacy, and compliance. Objective To propose a practical framework for integrating CGTs into health‐system pharmacy workflows, while addressing clinical, operational, and financial considerations. Summary The framework encompasses four domains: (1) evaluation —strategic assessment of pipeline therapies, including clinical, operational, and financial readiness; (2) clinical integration —formulary review, electronic medical record configuration, clinical pathways, and standard operating procedures development; (3) operational pharmacy integration —establishing infrastructure for receipt, storage, handling, and dispensing, supported by training and process improvement; and (4) financial integration —implementing reimbursement strategies, payment workflows, and budgeting to mitigate financial risk. These recommendations draw on the institutional experience of the authors and emerging standards from professional organizations. Conclusion Proactive planning and interdisciplinary collaboration are essential for successful CGT implementation. Health‐system pharmacists are uniquely positioned to lead these efforts, ensuring patient safety, operational efficiency, and financial sustainability as advanced therapeutics reshape the healthcare landscape.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction Livestock markets are critical hubs within animal trade networks that influence pathogen dissemination at the regional and national scale. Indeed, a 2016 Salmonella serovar Heidelberg outbreak, initially linked to surplus dairy calves at livestock markets, sickened 63 people across 17 states. The objectives of this repeated cross‐sectional study were to (i) assess the prevalence and relatedness of Salmonella serovars of public health relevance in Ohio and Wisconsin livestock markets; and (ii) determine if S . Heidelberg was circulating in Midwestern livestock markets. Methods Twenty‐four livestock markets (14 from WI and 10 from OH) were enrolled in the study from April to November 2019. Market environments were sampled twice 3 months apart. State inspectors used boot swabs to sample the loading docks, main livestock thruway, and two pens used to hold surplus calves at each market. Swabs were shipped overnight to the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory for sample culture and serotyping. Whole genome sequencing was conducted at the Ohio Department of Agriculture. Results Sample‐level Salmonella prevalence was 99.1% (111/112) in WI markets and 94.9% (75/79) in OH markets with all negative OH samples collected from the same market. Salmonella ser. Heidelberg was not recovered from any market; however, other serovars of public health relevance were identified including Newport, Agona and Typhimurium. Sequencing data revealed closely related strains across markets. For instance, a group of closely related Salmonella ser. Panama isolates was recovered from three WI markets, and the isolates clustered closely with isolates from retail meat, other livestock species, and human diagnostic labs. Conclusion These results suggest livestock markets play an important and under‐researched role in the dissemination of pathogens between livestock populations.",

    "Abstract": "Transparent conductive oxide (TCO) thin films are widely used in displays, photovoltaic devices, and transparent antennas. Indium tin oxide (ITO), with a resistivity below 10−5 Ω cm and a transmittance above 90%, remains the preferred material. However, the scarcity of indium and limited mechanical flexibility of ITO necessitate alternative TCOs. In this study, AZO/Ag/Ni/AZO multilayers were fabricated by introducing a Ni interlayer to mitigate the degradation caused by Ag diffusion and oxidation. The effects of Ni deposition parameters on the electrical, optical, and structural properties were systematically examined. Conventional AZO/Ag/AZO structures exhibited resistivity and transmittance of 12.15 × 10−5 Ω cm and 90.1%, respectively, whereas a 2 nm Ni layer deposited at 0.08 nm/s yielded resistivity and transmittance of 3.03 × 10−5 Ω cm and 74.7%, respectively, thereby demonstrating superior performance. Auger electron spectroscopy confirmed that the Ni interlayer effectively suppressed the diffusion and oxidation of Ag. X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy further revealed that Ni deposition strongly influenced the crystallinity and morphology of ZnO. Notably, slow deposition promoted the defects and nanoscale voids in the Ni layer, reducing the density and increasing the oxygen permeability. These results indicate that optimizing the Ni thickness and deposition rate is essential for enhancing barrier performance against Ag oxidation and diffusion. Moreover, further reduction in resistivity is required to utilize these multilayers in advanced applications, such as transparent antennas.",

We investigate whether these quantitative shifts alter the qualitative, global structure of the orbit manifold. Using a topological approach, we study timelike circular orbits (TCOs) for spinning particles in static, spherically symmetric spacetimes. By constructing an auxiliary vector field, we compute the topological winding number W in horizon-bounded regions of asymptotically flat, anti-de Sitter (AdS), and de Sitter (dS) backgrounds.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. The human microbiome plays an important role in regulating response to cancer therapeutics, outcomes, and biological processes. However, little is known regarding the interplay between the lung microbiome and other biological processes in cancer. In an exploratory pilot study, we collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and brushings from 20 patients with early-stage lung cancer and performed microbial sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and cytokine analysis. In addition, we employed computational and machine-learning approaches to identify integrated microbial-immunometabolic pathways. Finally, we performed preliminary mechanistic studies to confirm our findings. Previously, we published that upper airway microbiota were selectively enriched in tumor-affected lobes. In the present study we demonstrate that enrichment of pro-tumorigenic cytokines and specific fatty acids are associated with tumor-affected lobes. Finally, we find that long-chain fatty acid stimulation of macrophages leads to neoplastic transformation of lung epithelial cells. Therefore, the findings of this study identify a perturbed fatty acid-macrophage axis that is a potential biomarker of early-stage lung cancer and will lead to development of novel therapeutic agents.",

Consequently, we sought to determine if inhibition of CD28 survival signaling could increase MM sensitivity to CAR T cell therapy. Contrary to expectations, blockade of CD28 interaction with CD80/86 accelerated tumor regrowth in preclinical MM and lymphoma CAR T therapy models. Knockout studies revealed that endogenous CD28 on 4-1BB co-stimulated CAR T cells prolonged in vivo activity, reprogrammed mitochondrial metabolism to maintain redox balance, and stimulated proliferation and release of tumor-model specific inflammatory cytokines in the tumor microenvironment. Intriguingly, transient CD28 blockade decreased levels of certain TME cytokines without significantly affecting survival of CAR T cell treated mice. Collectively, these data provide direct evidence that endogenous CD28 signaling modulates CAR T cell responses in multiple myeloma and lymphoma models.",

However, the fluctuation of wind speed in its deployment poses operational and economic risk, which puts the generators at risk for energy price imbalances (EP IM ). The forecast errors between predicted and actual wind output, which can result in imbalance penalties, negatively impact renewable producers’ profitability, obstruct deeper integration of renewables, and stagnate economic growth. Herein, a comprehensive optimization mechanism has been introduced in this work by integrating state-of-the-art machine-learning (ML) models, that is, Random Forest (RF) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), with numerous metaheuristic optimization techniques, that is, Whale Optimization Algorithm, American Zebra Optimization (AZO) Algorithm, along with Sequential Quadratic Programing to maximize the system economy. The framework forecasts wind power and load demand concurrently through 24 h by embedding these into an optimal power flow framework: Maximizing profit for the system, and minimizing imbalance costs. It makes use of the real wind speed data of Tokyo for validation of the proposed method. The LSTM provides better forecasts than RF, and AZO continuously yields the best economic results after the implementation of the presented approach. The ML-metaheuristic approach facilitates dispatch efficiency, while simultaneously decreasing imbalance penalties and increasing the market profitability significantly. The proposed method is a technically feasible and operationally relevant approach to implementing a higher wind integration scale in Japan's deregulated market structure.",

    "Abstract": "Zambian journalism faces and endures precarious conditions that make practising professionally and ethically challenging. These difficulties, including polarisation, job insecurity or losses, threats and incidents of physical harm, and a burdensome regulatory and legal environment, have fostered a journalism culture that is more ad hoc than planned or considered, as journalists operate in a harsh environment. Using the In-depth Interview (IDI) approach to gather data phenomenologically, this paper examines the factors that have contributed to the current situation using thematic analysis. The study interviewed and analysed data from 24 Zambian journalists, editors and three media owners from both public and private media institutions between 2019 and 2025. The paper also explores the emerging journalistic cultures that result from these precarities, proposing coping strategies to handle both internal and external challenges. Findings indicate that ownership and State control are key factors. Consequently, journalists have adapted by practising contingency journalism, working on an ad hoc basis within the limits of professionalism as much as possible. These precarious conditions sometimes lead to post-ethical dilemmas, as they extend beyond professional boundaries, impacting livelihoods, personal security, and the safety of journalists and their families, considerations that are not strictly within professional parameters but significantly influence journalists personally, creating a contingency journalism culture that helps them navigate the difficult operating environment.",

    "Abstract": "The potential of choral singing to support well-being is increasingly recognized, yet most studies focus on adults or clinical populations. Research examining healthy neurotypical youth choir singers is emerging, but few explore its impact on well-being outcomes. This qualitative study explored how choir participation impacts youth well-being, examining the experiences of Serbian youth choir singers, aged 15 to 24. Focus group interviews were conducted with 26 participants (7 males and 19 females), including members of school and extracurricular choirs, to address motivation for joining, perceived benefits and challenges associated with choir participation, and the role of conductors. Thematic analysis, guided by Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and PERMA well-being frameworks, revealed significant socio-emotional benefits from choir participation. Passion for singing, social connections, and musical skill development were the major motivators for joining. Participants consistently reported benefits, including increased positive emotions, reduced stress, greater confidence, improved social interaction, increased support, personal growth, and the conductor’s encouragement, which were central to their well-being. Challenges like performance anxiety, intergroup dynamics, and rehearsal intensity were observed. The findings highlight the multidimensional benefits of choral singing and its potential to enhance well-being among healthy youth.",

    "Abstract": "New and efficient methods based on noise addition to protect the confidentiality in population statistics have been developed, tested, and applied in census production by various members of the European Statistical System over the past years. Basic demographic statistics—such as population stocks, live births and deaths by age, sex, and region—may be protected in a similar way, but also form the raw input to calculate various demographic indicators. This paper analyzes the impact on the accuracy of some selected indicators, namely fertility and mortality rates and life expectancies, under the assumption that the raw input counts are protected with a generic noise method with fixed variance parameter, by comparing the size of noise uncertainties with intrinsic statistical uncertainties using a Poisson model. As a by-product, we derive and validate numerically a closed analytical expression for the variance of life expectancies in a certain class of calculation models as a function of the variance of input mortality data. This expression also allows to calculate analytically the statistical uncertainty of life expectancies using the mentioned Poisson model for the input death counts.",

    "Abstract": "High-altitude environment with low atmospheric pressure will significantly reduce the torque and power of diesel engines at low-speeds. To enhance the low-speed characteristics of an existing diesel engine at high-altitude of 4500 m, a variable nozzle is designed and integrated with the fixed-geometry turbine. Based on the mean-line thermodynamic calculations assisted by genetic algorithm optimization, the three-dimensional modeling and simulations, and the one-dimensional engine simulation, a design method for variable geometry turbine (VGT) under the constraints of geometric and aerodynamic parameters is established. Under the constraints of maintaining the prototype turbine volute geometry and achieving equivalent flow capacity and efficiency at the design rotating speed, the fixed-geometry turbine is modified to be a VGT. The newly designed VGT has increased the turbine efficiency by 2% at the design rotating speed, and expanded the flow adjustment range by 31%. Based on the calibrated one-dimensional simulation model of the diesel engine, the VGT is evaluated at high-altitude of 4500 m. Compared to the diesel engine with the fixed-geometry turbine, the engine with the VGT shows improvements in torque and power by 10.41%, 19.28%, and 23.28% at engine speeds of 800, 1000, and 1200 rpm respectively.",

    "Abstract": "Aiming at the lane decision problem of autonomous driving (AD) in normal driving scenarios on structured road, with the goal of high safety and high efficiency, a lane decision algorithm for autonomous vehicles (AVs) considering potential driving risks is proposed. In this algorithm, by simulating the dimensions of human drivers’ attention to the driving environment (DE), the DE of AV is characterized from uncertainty, driving efficiency, and regional driving risk, based on the proposed potential risk field model, right-of-way (ROW) field model, and regional performance risk field model. Furthermore, by mining the behavioral patterns of human drivers’ lane decision based on their natural driving behavior data, the proposed algorithm has the ability to simulate the human drivers’ lane decision behavior. This is beneficial for integrating AVs into practical driving scenarios and will not cause discomfort to surrounding vehicles (SVs). In a continuous complex dynamic scenario composed of eight sub-scenarios, the performance verification based on two baseline algorithms and the performance comparison with six advanced algorithms are carried out. The results show that the proposed algorithm can balance driving safety and efficiency and select an optimal lane for AV.",

    "Abstract": "This study proposes a materials-by-design approach to develop a laminated composite from alternating layers of flexible polyvinyl chloride and a cellulose-based adhesive, aiming to produce functional, high-precision planar components. The polymer–matrix composite was engineered to overcome key limitations of additive manufacturing, such as poor interlayer adhesion and low-dimensional accuracy. This novel material was compressed into 5 mm blocks and laser-cut to fabricate a pair of functional square gears. Tensile testing revealed a fourfold increase in tensile strength equal to 44.05 MPa for samples loaded parallel to the build direction compared to raw polyvinyl chloride. Quantitative T-peel tests confirmed strong bonding, with a steady-state force of 8–11 N and a calculated energy release rate of 760 J/m 2 , ensuring structural integrity and resistance to delamination. Functional testing of the manufactured gears confirmed smooth mating through 360° rotation, achieving a dimensional accuracy of 0.01 mm and a gear tooth flank surface roughness of 5.36 µm. The results demonstrate that this laminated composite offers superior in-plane mechanical properties, making it a promising candidate for planar mechanisms. The methodology is further validated as a high-precision, cost-effective, and rapid alternative to additive manufacturing, suggesting a significant potential for use in engineering education and functional prototyping.",

    "Abstract": "Background Multifactorial health complaints associated with indoor work environments can impact on employees’ work ability and arouse controversies in the workplace. Traditionally, solutions have centered on building-related factors, however supporting work ability requires a multi-perspective approach. Objective This study explored relevant perspectives for implementing a multi-perspective work ability support model. This model represents a complex intervention within the intricate context of indoor environment-related health complaints in the workplace. Methods We used recordings and notes from the workshops of a project aiming to implement the work ability support model in three organizations and used reflexive thematic analysis. We developed overarching themes from the data, using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as an interpretative lens to structure the findings into implementation perspectives. Results We developed four overarching themes encompassing all CFIR domains and most constructs: (1) the acknowledgment and validation of employees’ emotions and experiences as a solution, (2) reliable information and detailed facts as the key to managing work ability support, (3) existing tools as a means to normalization and collaboration, and (4) supervisors as central actors in a challenging task. Conclusions Implementing a work ability support model regarding complex phenomena affecting work ability, such as indoor environment-related health complaints, requires identifying and addressing the potential tensions and controversies underlying the model and requires consideration of the context. Viewing communication as a process of developing shared understanding and co-constructing knowledge throughout the implementation process and all its dimensions can be beneficial for the implementation.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Central venous stenosis (CVS) is a clinically significant complication in patients who depend on long-term hemodialysis access. While digital subtraction angiography remains the diagnostic gold standard, it is invasive, costly, and exposes patients to contrast and radiation. This study examined the diagnostic value of a simple, non-invasive, radiation-free alternative—the ultrasound-guided “sniff test,” which assesses dynamic changes in subclavian vein diameter during a forceful sniff to screen for CVS. Despite its potential advantages, the diagnostic performance of this method has not been well established. Method: A prospective study was conducted among 71 end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients scheduled for angiography. Each participant underwent a sniff test before the procedure. A reduction of more than 40% in subclavian vein diameter during sniffing was considered normal, indicating absence of stenosis. Angiographic findings were used as the reference standard. Clinical signs—specifically ipsilateral arm swelling and visible chest wall veins—were also evaluated for diagnostic utility. Results: Angiography confirmed CVS in 32 patients (45.1%). The sniff test showed a strong association with stenosis (OR 20.9) and demonstrated solid diagnostic performance, with sensitivity of 84.4%, specificity of 79.5%, and an AUC of 0.82. A normal sniff test accurately excluded stenosis in the majority of patients without CVS (86.1%), whereas an abnormal result was predominantly seen among those with stenosis (77.1%). Arm swelling was also significantly associated with stenosis (OR 20.40) and showed good standalone diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 75.0%, specificity 87.2%, AUC 0.81). Importantly, combining the sniff test with clinical assessment enhanced overall performance, achieving higher specificity (94.9%) and excellent discriminative ability (AUC 0.90). Conclusion: In conclusion, the ultrasound sniff test is a promising, accessible, and accurate screening tool for CVS. Used alone or alongside clinical findings, it offers a practical method to identify patients who may benefit from confirmatory angiography—particularly valuable in resource-limited or radiation-averse settings.",

    "Abstract": "Anxiety in autism is often misunderstood when compared with neurotypical experiences. It is not as simple as saying, “It’s okay, everyone gets anxious.” Anxiety in autism is not merely a transient experience but often a persistent and pervasive challenge shaped by both neurobiological differences and societal structures. While transient (state) anxiety is common in the general population, many autistic individuals can experience chronic (trait) anxiety, deeply intertwined with sensory sensitivities, social challenges, and the cumulative weight of past traumas. This article examines the complex nature of anxiety in autism, emphasizing how systemic barriers, stigma, and learned coping mechanisms contribute to sustained distress. It explores how societal pressures and internalized responses create self-reinforcing anxiety cycles, supported by psychological and neurobiological mechanisms. The article offers multilevel suggestions—spanning societal, community, professional, research, and individual levels—highlighting the need for inclusive, flexible approaches that account for the diversity of the autistic experience. Addressing both external barriers and internal challenges, these suggestions aim to promote well-being and reduce the burden of anxiety across the autism spectrum.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Autism genetics has historically attracted a substantial proportion of autism research funding internationally. However, more recently, several controversies centered on ethical conduct and lack of community consultation have emerged. This has triggered Autistic-led protests for the functional and meaningful inclusion of Autistic voices in the research design. Methods: We collaborated with Autistic people, their allies, and other stakeholders concerned with Autistic outcomes to cocreate a qualitative study investigating individuals’ perceptions of autism genetics. We spoke to 33 Australian Autistic people, their families and supporters, and autism professionals in a series of codesigned semi-structured interviews ( n = 20), focus groups ( n = 2 groups), and qualitative surveys ( n = 7). Interviewees were predominantly women (79%), White (67%), held postgraduate qualifications (i.e., master’s, doctorate) (36%), and received their autism diagnosis or self-diagnosed in adulthood (where applicable, 93%). Many interviewees held multiple intersecting roles across the Autistic and autism communities. We transcribed their data verbatim and analyzed these within a critical realist framework using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Community members reported concerns about the eugenic potential of genetics research and how it perpetuates negative attitudes about autism and Autistic people. Interviewees felt a sense of disillusionment and distrust toward the field stemming from persistent failure of autism researchers to integrate community needs within its aims. Some believed that while genetics knowledge could hold health benefits for the Autistic community, these could only be achieved through trust-building and improved engagement of Autistic voices in this research. Conclusion: Findings highlight the diverse community perspectives on autism genetics research within Australia, capturing how genetic studies are perceived to ignore the wants, needs, and priorities of Autistic people and their supporters. These insights offer a unique opportunity to reevaluate the trajectory of autism genetics research into the future, with a strong call to action from participants to embed Autistic voices in a functionally meaningful way at all levels and stages of knowledge generation.",

Methods: We recruited 1369 autistic participants for an online survey designed through consultation with autistic people. Participants were 326 cisgender men, 718 cisgender women, and 325 transgender or gender-divergent individuals, ranging from 16 to 89 years old. We asked them to rate the importance of 19 contributing factors to their suicidal thoughts and feelings and to enter their own explanations of additional factors if desired. Alongside thematically analyzing this qualitative data, we examined whether ratings of contributing factors differed by age and gender and whether ratings statistically predicted levels of lifetime suicidality. Results: Loneliness, feelings of worthlessness/failure, hopelessness, and mental illness were the highest rated contributing factors to suicidal thoughts and feelings, particularly by autistic women and sex/gender minorities; ratings also differed by age. Qualitative responses indicated the complexity of suicidality, wherein autistic status influenced both the nature of the stressors (e.g., societal stigma) and cognitive-emotional states (e.g., feeling disconnected through feeling different to others) that participants identified. Greater perceived importance of bullying, difficulties accessing support, and past trauma characterized participants with experience of suicide plans or attempts. Conclusion: While some of the experiences and mental states identified by participants resembled those identified in non-autistic groups, the psychological profile of autistic participants and their experiences of marginalization appeared to heavily contextualize expressions of hopelessness, burdensomeness, worthlessness, loneliness, and entrapment. Autistic people vary with regard to the factors perceived to underpin suicidality. However, associations between suicidality and the perceived importance of bullying, trauma, and inability to access support highlight the necessity of societal and systemic change to prevent suicide.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Wood absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and by being converted into wood-based materials, stores carbon in the long term, thereby contributing to the mitigation of global warming. Wood production relies on adhesives, making a detailed understanding of the adhesive interface essential to ensure performance. In this study, the confocal laser scanning microscope used was capable of simultaneously detecting three distinct fluorescence wavelengths. This setup allows clear visualization of the distributions of melamine–urea–formaldehyde resin (MUF) and polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (pMDI) within plywood, enabling precise differentiation of each component and providing detailed insights into their spatial distributions. Microscopic analyses revealed that MUF infiltrates intercellular spaces and ray tracheids, extending outward from the adhesive interface. In contrast, pMDI is observed not only near the adhesive interface, but also in the cell lumens located farther from the interface. The authors propose that the penetration of water-based, low-viscosity adhesives, such as MUF, is facilitated by pathways that originally served as water conduits in living wood, enabling efficient transport through wood structures. Conversely, the penetration of hydrophobic, viscous adhesives, such as pMDI, into such narrow spaces is limited. However, pMDI can penetrate through openings in areas where cell lumens are exposed on the cut surface of the wood and spread into the cell lumens. The fundamentally distinct penetration mechanisms of MUF and pMDI allow them to function without interfering with each other. This complementary behavior suggests that a hybrid adhesive system comprising both materials could exploit their respective strengths and enhance bonding performance while reducing the limitations of each adhesive individually.",

    "Abstract": "Electrospinning has emerged as a powerful nanofabrication technique for producing continuous polymer nanofibers with diameters ranging from sub-micrometers to nanometers. This technique is important in several discipline areas which are able to make high-surface-area materials with tunable properties that will allow applications for biomedicine, filtration, and tissue engineering. This review explores both needle-based and needleless electrospinning methods, including their sub-techniques, advantages, limitations, and influencing process parameters. Particular attention is given to how electric field strength, solution properties, and environmental factors affect nanofiber morphology and performance. In parallel, the review delves into the physicochemical characteristics and structural dynamics of starch, a biodegradable and renewable polysaccharide with vast potential in nanotechnology and food science. The phenomena of starch gelatinization and retrogradation are examined with respect to their functional implications in fiber formation and food applications. By integrating insights from electrospinning and starch science, this study highlights the prospects for developing starch-based nanofibers, offering sustainable solutions for biomedical, packaging, and dietary applications. This paper, in contrast to the most recent reviews describing electrospinning principles or the properties of starch independently, does provide a meaningful comparison of needle-based versus needleless techniques, and evaluate the effects of starch's physicochemical transitions on nanofiber performance. This comparative analysis can identify existing gaps, and show where starch-based systems were stronger than synthetic polymers with regards to sustainability, but weaker in mechanical strength and scalability. The paper concludes with future research directions that bridge nanotechnology and biopolymer engineering.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Insects comprise one of Earth’s most diverse animal groups, but the adaptive capacity of most species, especially those with weak genetic structure, remains understudied. Psolodesmus mandarinus is an endemic damselfly in Taiwan, where its populations show latitudinal variation in wing traits despite limited genetic differentiation in mitochondrial and ribosomal sequences. We hypothesised that weak genome-wide structure may obscure the signals of local adaptation driven by environmental variation. To test this, we integrated genome-wide SNPs, phenotypic measurements, environmental associations, and species distribution models. Results Although genome-wide population structure was generally weak, pairwise F ST values exceeded 0.35 between southeastern and northeastern populations, and genetic-environment association analyses identified outlier loci and individuals associated with environmental variables. Wing traits, particularly wing colours, exhibited a latitudinal divergence and exceeded expectations from neutral structure ( P ST &gt; F ST ), indicating selection. Species distribution models showed ecological differentiation and predicted range expansion for clear-winged individuals but range contraction for dark-winged individuals under future climate scenarios. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate that phenotypic divergence can arise and persist under weak genetic structure, highlighting the evolutionary potential for local adaptation in structured environments even in species with high dispersal potential. An integrative framework provides essential insights for predicting biodiversity responses to environmental change and guiding climate-resilient conservation strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Geriatric syndromes (GS) describe complex health challenges in older patients. Understanding the perceptions of geriatric syndromes as age-related vs. disease-related can help to identify different patterns of health-seeking behavior (HSB) for GS among older adults. Methods In this explorative, cross-sectional study, we investigate the prevalence and perception of various GS (falls, gait disturbance, pain, urinary incontinence, memory loss, depressive symptoms, loss of social contacts) in a geriatric cohort ( n = 94, mean age 82.5 ± 5.29 years, 62.8% female). Variables included the presence of GS, their perceived impact, and whether they were viewed as age-related or disease-related (visual analogue scale). HSB was assessed based on whether patients sought medical consultation, received diagnostics, or underwent therapy for the GS. Additional variables included a comprehensive geriatric assessment, health literacy, locus of control, and views on aging. Results The study found significant variations in HSB among different GS. Overall, 94.7% of the patients experienced at least one GS. The most frequently reported GS were falls (59.6%), gait problems (55.3%), and pain (51.1%). Incontinence (39.4%), falls (37.5%), and gait problems (32.7%) were considered the most relevant GS by the patients. Pain (89.6%), incontinence (72.7%), and gait problems (69.2%) were the primary reasons for seeking medical consultation, with therapeutic measures more commonly initiated for pain (70.8%) than for gait disorders (28.8%) and incontinence (33.3%). Symptoms of depression and memory loss received minimal medical attention. Pain was predominantly perceived as disease-related, with corresponding higher HSB, whereas memory loss was often seen as age-related, with corresponding lower HSB. There was no significant association between GS ratings (age or disease-related) and sex, living situation, social support, education level, health literacy, or locus of control. However, a positive view on aging correlated with perceiving depressive symptoms and lack of energy as disease-related. Conclusion This explorative study suggests that the individual perceptions of GS may impact the use of medical services. Future confirmatory studies are necessary to develop targeted interventions addressing these perceptions in order to improve the health behavior of older adults.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Geriatric depression affects 12.95-28.4% of adults aged ≥ 60, yet treatment rates remain critically low globally. Lifestyle factors, particularly exercise and sleep demonstrate therapeutic potential, integrated interventions may exert synergistic effects on geriatric depression, though such interventions remain scarce. The Geriatric Exercise-Sleep Optimization (GESO) project aims to evaluate the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a combined exercise and sleep health intervention in alleviating depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults with depression, and exploring the potential underlying mechanisms. This is a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial (SW-CRT). A 12-week integrated exercise and sleep intervention will be implemented to all eligible participants during the study period. The primary aim is to evaluate the clinical efficacy in alleviating depressive symptoms. Secondary aims are to evaluate the additional health outcomes (i.e., quality of life, physical activity level, daily step count, sleep quality, and anxiety symptom), cost-effectiveness, and potential mechanisms. Costs will be aggregated and analyzed for economic evaluation. Costs will be aggregated and analyzed for economic evaluation. Salivary measured BDNF and irisin levels, and EEG-based brain function connectivity will be collected to assess potential intervention mechanisms. Mixed-effect linear regression models will be used to evaluate the effects of the integrated exercise-sleep intervention on primary and secondary outcomes. This study is expected to provide an effective and practical mode for an integrated exercise and sleep intervention among community-dwelling older adults with depression. Intended outcomes of the trial will facilitate changes in best practice to improve outcomes for this population.

    "Abstract": "Abnormal birth weight, including macrosomia and low birth weight, constitutes a significant global health burden associated with both immediate neonatal risks and long-term metabolic complications. However, accurate prediction remains challenging due to fragmented clinical indicators and a lack of model interpretability, limitations often inherent in traditional statistical approaches that struggle with complex, high-dimensional data. This study developed interpretable machine learning models that integrate multifaceted maternal and fetal characteristics to enhance prediction accuracy and facilitate causal analysis. Key features were identified through statistical significance and correlation tests, and causal inference was conducted using G-computation. Among 14 evaluated models, XGBoost achieved optimal performance with AUC values of 0.997 for macrosomia and 0.992 for low birth weight. Feature importance analysis revealed distinct pathogenic pathways-metabolic and biometric factors were most predictive for macrosomia, whereas placental and hemodynamic factors dominated low birth weight prediction. These insights provide a robust and interpretable framework for early risk detection, supporting personalized antenatal management and improved perinatal healthcare strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Knee osteoarthritis is a highly disabling chronic disease that imposes a substantial societal burden.Short video platforms have become a primary source of health information in China, yet the quality of such content is highly variable. There is currently a lack of systematic and multi-platform assessments of knee osteoarthritis-related information quality on these platforms. Method This study retrieved and included 300 videos related to knee osteoarthritis from three platforms—TikTok, Bilibili, and Rednote—as the analytical sample. The basic characteristics of the videos (likes, comments, duration, etc.), the identities of the publishers (orthopedic surgeons, other medical personnel, institutions, and ordinary users), and the content types were collected and analyzed with descriptive statistics. Three standardized tools, Global Quality Scale (GQS), modified DISCERN (mDISCERN), and The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), were used to independently assess the quality of the videos. We also examined the correlation between these quality scores and video features. Result There were significant differences among the three platforms. TikTok videos had the highest user engagement but the shortest duration (median 108 s); Bilibili had the longest video duration (median 262 s), and achieved a significantly higher median GQS score 3(IQR2-4) than Rednote 2(IQR2-3) ( p &lt; 0.001); Rednote performed the best and was the most stable in JAMA scores ( p &lt; 0.01). The quality scores of videos released by medical professionals and institutions were significantly higher than those of ordinary users in all assessment tools ( p &lt; 0.01). Correlation analysis showed that video quality (GQS, mDISCERN, JAMA) was only weakly or insignificantly correlated with the popularity indicators (likes, followers, etc.), but a positive correlation trend with video duration. Conclusion The generally suboptimal quality of knee osteoarthritis information on Chinese short-video platforms and its disconnect from popularity metrics highlight a growing public health concern. As short videos increasingly serve as a key source of health information, it is imperative to strengthen content quality oversight. Collaborative efforts among platforms, health authorities, and the public are essential to improve the reliability of online health content and support public access to accurate health information.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective To explore the potential mechanisms of interstitial cystitis (IC), we employed a cyclophosphamide (CYP)-induced cystitis rat model, a well-established tool for studying IC-like bladder inflammation and dysfunction. This study aimed to investigate the role of rhythmic genes and immune microenvironment remodeling in this model, focusing on TOP2A and its impact on T-cell infiltration. Methods CYP-induced cystitis rat models were established using cyclophosphamide. Single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on bladder tissues to analyze cellular heterogeneity. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified rhythmic and immune-related gene clusters. TOP2A was validated via RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Statistical analyses assessed correlations between TOP2A, CD4 + T cells, and CD8 + T cells. Results Single-cell sequencing revealed elevated T-cell infiltration in a CYP-induced cystitis rat model. TOP2A was the sole overlapping gene between rhythmic and immune clusters and showed significant upregulation in IC tissues ( P &lt; 0.05). IHC confirmed increased TOP2A, CD4 + T, and CD8 + T cell levels, with strong positive correlations ( r = 0.89 and 0.64, respectively). Functional enrichment linked TOP2A to oxidative phosphorylation and ribosomal pathways. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that TOP2A drives immune dysregulation in CYP-induced cystitis by modulating T-cell infiltration. As T-cell infiltration is a hallmark of human IC, our findings in this CYP-induced model suggest that TOP2A may represent a novel therapeutic target worthy of further investigation in human IC tissues.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Jaw cysts are a diverse group of intraosseous lesions commonly encountered in oral and maxillofacial pathologies. Several studies have addressed their distribution and clinicopathological features; however, further large-scale analyses using standardized classification systems may enhance cross-regional comparability and diagnostic consistency. We aimed to evaluate the demographic and anatomical characteristics of jaw cysts over an almost 50-year period. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 19,352 histologically confirmed jaw cysts diagnosed between 1975 and 2024. Each case was reclassified according to the 2022 WHO classifications for head and neck tumors. Patient age, sex, cyst type, and anatomical location data were collected and descriptively analyzed to identify trends across different cyst categories. Results Odontogenic cysts comprised the majority of cases. Radicular cysts were the most common, followed by dentigerous cysts and odontogenic keratocysts. Non-odontogenic cysts mainly consisted of surgical ciliated cysts and nasopalatine duct cysts. Bone cysts (simple bone cysts and aneurysmal bone cysts), which lack an epithelial lining and were therefore analyzed separately, were infrequent. A male predominance was observed overall, with sex- and age-related patterns differing according to cyst type. Mandibular involvement was more common than maxillary involvement, and several cysts showed specific anatomical predilections. These findings highlight distinct demographic and anatomical characteristics across cyst categories. Conclusions This large retrospective study provides a detailed epidemiological profile of jaw cysts. The findings revealed distinct patterns according to cyst type, age, sex, and anatomical site, providing a valuable reference for diagnostic refinement and future comparative studies of oral and maxillofacial pathology.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Acetaminophen overdose is a leading cause of drug-induced acute liver damage, underscoring the urgent need for accessible hepatoprotective therapies. This study evaluated the hepatoprotective effects of Aqueous Aloe vera gel extract on acetaminophen-induced liver damage in adult male Albino Wistar rats. Methodology Liver Damage was induced in Albino Wistar rats by oral administration of acetaminophen (750 mg/kg). The rats were divided into six groups: normal control, negative control, positive control (silymarin 50 mg/kg), and three treatment groups receiving Aloe vera gel extract at doses of 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg, and 1000 mg/kg. Body and liver weight, hematological, biochemical and oxidative stress parameters and liver histology were assessed after 7 days of treatment. Results Treatment with Aloe vera gel extract demonstrated dose-dependent hepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects with the 1000 mg/kg dose exhibiting efficacy comparable to silymarin. Higher doses (1000 mg/kg) significantly increase both the body weight and weight of the liver ( p = 0.0265 and p = 0.0061); decreased the white blood cell count ( p = 0.0034) and also improved hematological parameters. The extract at 1000 mg/kg also enhanced antioxidant status by reducing MDA levels ( p &lt; 0.0001) while increasing SOD ( p &lt; 0.0001) and catalase activities. Histological examination also showed that higher doses of the aqueous Aloe vera gel extract restored liver histoarchitecture, with clearly defined nuclei and cell borders. Conclusion This study demonstrates that the aqueous Aloe vera gel extract mitigates acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative mechanisms. At 1000 mg/kg, it restored hepatic histoarchitecture, haematological homeostasis, normalized liver function biomarkers, and suppressed oxidative stress, rivalling silymarin in efficacy. The observed improvements in liver histology, haematological parameters, and antioxidant biomarkers indicate Aloe vera ’s therapeutic potential, likely mediated through its bioactive constituents with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Further research is recommended to understand its mechanism of action, long-term and potential clinical applications.",

Rather than inhibiting individual proteins, these interventions reshape the cellular organization itself. By targeting the material and functional properties of condensates, such strategies offer a new conceptual framework for therapeutic design in complex, dysregulated biological systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Data on the external validation of current dementia risk prediction models has not yet been systematically synthesised. This systematic review and meta-analysis collated results from three previous reviews to evaluate the predictive discriminative performance of dementia risk models when validated in population-based settings. Methods Embase (via Ovid), Medline (via Ovid), Scopus, and Web of Science were searched from inception to June 2022 with an updated search conducted up to November 2024. Included studies (1) had a population-based cohort design; (2) assessed incident late-life (i.e. ≥ 60 years) dementia; and (3) reported predictive performance of at least one dementia risk prediction model in an independent validation sample. Information on study characteristics, dementia outcomes, prediction models (including whether they were fully validated [all original variables available and mapped] or partially validated [one or more variables missing or substituted]), and their discriminative performance were extracted in duplicate. Discrimination, quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) or c -statistic, was pooled across studies using a random-effects model. Models were stratified by validation type: fully versus partially validated. Results Thirty-six studies were included. Seventeen studies undertook full validation (14 unique prediction models) and were included in the meta-analysis. Predictor count ranged from one to 57. For all-cause dementia, RADaR showed the highest performance ( c -statistic = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.80–0.86; n = 2 validations), followed by eRADAR ( c -statistic = 0.81, 95%CI: 0.75–0.85; n = 2 validations). The BDSI model had the most validations (all-cause dementia c -statistic = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.69–0.75; n = 13 validations; and Alzheimer’s disease c -statistic = 0.74, 95%CI: 0.61–0.87; n = 2 validations) and performed similarly across high- and middle-income counties. Most validations (76%) were conducted in high-income countries, with 24% in upper-middle income countries. Considerable variation in heterogeneity was observed across models ( I 2 values ranging from 0 to 99%). Conclusions Several dementia risk prediction models demonstrate moderate to high external validity. The BDSI model, tested across multiple settings and dementia outcomes, showed promising generalisability. However, the limited number of fully validated models and scarcity of studies in low-income country settings highlight the need for further research on feasibility, resource requirements, and cost-effectiveness before clinical adoption.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background We argue implementation research pays insufficient attention to time. We were prompted by learning gained from the Harnessing Innovation in Global Health for Quality Care (HIGH-Q) programme to explore implementation through time as an analytical lens. Time directly underpins how individuals, teams, and organisations adopt and sustain new practices, yet existing frameworks primarily reference it indirectly. We propose that considering time as a multi-dimensional construct is relevant to the science of implementation in complex systems and to promoting its thoughtful practice. Arguments HIGH-Q research involved coordinated ethnographic, quantitative and interventional studies of workforce enhancements in hospitals already benefiting from long-term neonatal technology and quality improvement support. Findings made it clear how time scarcity constrains improvement and use of new technologies in low-resource environments. New clinical technologies such as continuous positive airway pressure require time of users directly and indirectly linked to new cognitive and coordination work. Tasks compete for scarce time resulting in prioritisation, while time is needed for skill development, reflection, and team adaptation. Conceptually we suggest the following: (1) time functions as a finite and negotiable resource that must be deliberately allocated to new practices, without creating temporal space, change efforts risk displacing existing essential work; (2) “hidden time” is required for reflection, collaboration, management and internalisation of new routines—activities rarely acknowledged in project planning; (3) time is an expression of value, reflecting what actors prioritise and the moral or organisational meaning attached to the allocation of effort; (4) healthcare work is governed by temporal structures—shifts, schedules, and social norms—that may hinder flexibility and adaptation; (5) maintaining “time in reserve” supports resilience and psychological recovery in stressful environments, yet interventions may erode this capacity; and (6) implementers’ own time investments are frequently omitted when characterising interventions, despite being crucial for sustainability. Conclusions Viewing implementation through the prism of time exposes hidden constraints and misalignments between expectations, timelines and real-world conditions. Time in its multiple manifestations should be explicitly examined alongside theories of change and implementation frameworks to help understand why interventions in complex systems succeed or fail, especially where personnel and resources are already scarce.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Estrogen therapy and androgen‑deprivation were once combined to treat prostate cancer (PrCa). Clinical studies later showed that prolonged estrogen exposure in androgen‑deprived men raises cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, yet the metabolic pathways responsible remain unclear. Methods We generated an androgen‑deprived, 17β‑estradiol (E2)–treated mouse model by gonadectomizing male C57BL/6 J mice and implanting sub‑cutaneous delayed‑release E2 or vehicle pellets. Mice received a Western‑style diet and were housed at thermoneutrality to accelerate CVD‑risk phenotypes. Metabolic profiling included hyperinsulinemic‑euglycemic clamps, oral lipid and pyruvate tolerance tests, flow cytometry of immune cells, and single‑nucleus RNA sequencing of liver tissue. Results In hypogonadal males, E2 treatment induced several metabolic disturbances. During clamps, E2‑treated mice showed markedly elevated gluconeogenesis, corroborated by higher glucose peaks and AUC during pyruvate tolerance testing and by up‑regulation of hepatic Pck1 mRNA. Triglyceride (TG) clearance, which improves with E2 in females, was impaired in E2‑treated males: oral lipid‑tolerance testing revealed prolonged TG excursions, reduced maximal lipase activity, lower non‑lipase clearance at 6 h post-OLTT, and decreased free‑fatty‑acid peak levels. Hepatic lipase, VLDL clearance receptors Ldlr and Lrp1, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) transcripts were down‑regulated. SnRNA‑seq showed suppression of lipid‑clearance genes with E2 treatment in males. Subcutaneous adipocytes were hypertrophic, and flow cytometry identified increased TNFα‑positive macrophages, an inflammatory milieu that could promote insulin resistance. Cardiac morphology was modestly altered; E2‑treated males exhibited a larger left‑ventricular end‑diastolic diameter, while ejection fraction and arterial pressure remained unchanged. Conclusion Estradiol administration in androgen‑deprived male mice produces a constellation of metabolic derangements—including enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis, impaired TG clearance, and inflammatory adipocyte hypertrophy—that likely underlie the increased CVD risk observed clinically. The identified molecular nodes (PEPCK, hepatic lipase, LRP1, LDLR, MTP, and adipose‑macrophage TNFα) provide potential targets for mitigating estrogen‑induced CVD risk while preserving its therapeutic benefit for PrCa.

    "Abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent malignant tumors among women worldwide. The incidence of breast cancer in China has been steadily increasing, posing a significant public health concern that gravely jeopardizes women's well-being. Given the heterogeneity and drug resistance associated with breast cancer, conventional treatment methods are inadequate to meet current therapeutic demands, necessitating the urgent development of new biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Ferroptosis, characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation-induced cell membrane rupture, represents a form of programmed cell death. As ferroptosis gains increasing attention for its role in cancer biology, its potential value as an anti-cancer therapy is being gradually explored. However, our understanding of tumor cell ferroptosis in breast cancer remains incomplete, particularly at the single-cell level where knowledge is limited. Therefore, delving into the heterogeneous response of breast cancer cells to ferroptosis and elucidating its regulatory mechanisms hold great significance for comprehending the biological behavior of breast cancer and devising novel therapeutic strategies. In this study, we reanalyzed single-cell RNA-seq data from 26 breast cancer patients using a non-negative matrix (NMF) algorithm. GSEA enrichment analysis was employed to identify tumor subsets most susceptible to ferroptosis while pseudotiming was utilized to pinpoint MXRA8 as a key gene regulating ferroptosis. CellChat was applied to explore relationships between different subsets and various immune cell populations. Finally, we conducted in vitro experiments to validate MXRA8's involvement in regulating ferroptosis in cancer cells. This study unveils the crucial role played by ferroptosis-related tumor subsets in breast cancer progression and tumor immunity.",

    "Abstract": "Biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) is an aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis, and chemotherapy's effectiveness is limited, especially after first-line therapy failure. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) offer a promising platform for in vitro drug-sensitivity testing to optimize subsequent-line chemotherapy, but the clinical efficacy and prognostic value remain underexplored. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 85 advanced BTC patients, with 25 receiving CTC-based drug-sensitivity-guided chemotherapy (CSBT), 15 receiving FOLFOX based chemotherapy, and 45 receiving empirical therapy. CTCs were enriched and tested for drug sensitivity using a glucose uptake assay. Therapeutic efficacy, including patient response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity profiles, was evaluated. The results indicated that the objective response rate (ORR) was 16% in CSBT, 6.7% in FOLFOX, and 4.4% in the empirical group. The disease control rate (DCR) was significantly higher in CSBT group (56%) compared to the FOLFOX (20%) and empirical therapy (22.2%; p < 0.05) groups. Median PFS (mPFS) was significantly prolonged in the CSBT group (5.4 months) versus the FOLFOX (1.9 months) and empirical therapy (2.7 months; p < 0.05) groups. Median OS (mOS) was extended in the CSBT group (12 months) compared with the FOLFOX (5.1 months) and EBT group (7.8 months), with a significant improvement during the first year of treatment (p < 0.05). Toxicity profiles were similar across all groups. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that CTC-based drug sensitivity testing offers a potential strategy to guide subsequent anti-cancer therapy for advanced BTC, providing a safe and effective approach to improving patient prognosis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Mathematical modeling can be a useful approach to explore potential impact of malaria interventions and thereby inform resource prioritization decisions. However, expertise for applied modeling for public health decision-making is limited in malaria-endemic countries. A 4-month faculty enrichment program (FEP) in applied malaria modeling was implemented at Northwestern University, USA, in 2022 and 2023 with components including technical skills development, communication skills development, and domain knowledge on malaria epidemiology. Methods Two cohorts of FEP participants and instructors were interviewed at baseline, midline, and endline to understand their expectations, experiences, and challenges with the program. Results Participants valued their growth in technical expertise, research skills, and communication ability, as well as clear opportunities for knowledge transfer at their home institutions. Participants reported challenges with cross-disciplinary learning, balancing program components, and adapting to new teaching and learning styles. Instructors adapted program structures and teaching approaches to adjust to participant needs and reported strengthening of their own technical capacity. Conclusion Training programs for technical skill development must be informed by the needs and priorities of prospective participants and include continuous feedback mechanisms to respond to emerging needs. Multi-pronged approaches increase long-term program value to participants and help establish pathways for knowledge transfer.",

    "Abstract": "Lymph node metastasis (LNM) represents a distinctive stage in cancer progression, exerting a profound impact on patient prognosis. Accumulating studies have unveiled that tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) play a pivotal role in immunotherapy, functioning as an armory for anti-tumor immunity. Concurrently, LNM itself accelerates systemic metastatic progression, exacerbates systemic immunosuppression, and in turn fuels tumor progression. Recent advancements in single-cell sequencing technology have furnished insights into the mechanisms of LNM at single-cell resolution, unraveling the process of LNM in tumor cells and accompanying microenvironmental alterations from the perspectives of cellular heterogeneity, intercellular communication, and cellular evolutionary trajectories. Furthermore, single-cell sequencing studies have underscored the critical role of TDLNs in immunotherapy and their corresponding adaptive modifications. This article reviews the LNM microenvironment and immunosuppressive mechanisms revealed by single-cell sequencing technology, summarizes the novel targets for LNM and the current status of LNM-related immunotherapy research, and outlines the current challenges and future development directions from both technological and research content perspectives.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) is the primary cause of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Antiviral therapy is crucial to reduce MTCT for pregnant women with high viremia. Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) are the first-line antiviral drugs for hepatitis B. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TAF and TDF in preventing HBV MTCT among treatment-naïve mothers. Methods A total of 290 pregnant women with HBsAg positive for &gt; 6 months, and HBV DNA ≥ 2 × 10^5 IU/ml or HBeAg positive were enrolled. Mothers received either TDF or TAF therapy and newborns received hepatitis B immunoglobulin and recombinant yeast hepatitis B vaccine. MTCT was evaluated during a one-year follow-up period after birth. Results 290 pregnant women (185 with TDF therapy and 105 with TAF therapy) and 296 newborns (190 in TDF group and 106 in TAF group) were included. Both TDF and TAF effectively deceased HBV DNA levels with no significant difference, and the MTCT rates in TDF group and TAF group were similarly low (1.08% vs. 0.95%, P &gt; 0.05). Moreover, no congenital malformations or growth and developmental abnormalities in newborns were observed in either group. However, serum creatinine was significantly higher and eGFR decreased significantly when treated by TDF, whereas TAF showed no significant renal effects. Conclusions Both TAF and TDF are effective in preventing HBV MTCT, with comparable MTCT rates. However, TAF demonstrated superior renal safety, making it a preferable option for preventing HBV MTCT in treatment-naïve mothers.",

    "Abstract": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are a widely prescribed class of psychoactive drugs known for their rapid anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and sedative effects. Introduced as safer alternatives to barbiturates, BZDs quickly gained popularity across clinical settings but have since become a subject of public health concern due to rising rates of misuse, dependence, and overdose, particularly when co-administered with opioids. This narrative review explores the historical development, pharmacologic mechanisms, clinical indications, and adverse outcomes associated with BZD use, while highlighting emerging areas of research such as pharmacogenetics (PGx) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS). BZDs act as positive allosteric modulators of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, enhancing inhibitory neurotransmission. This mechanism underlies both their therapeutic efficacy and their potential for physiological dependence and misuse. Clinical applications span acute anxiety, insomnia, seizure management, and alcohol withdrawal; however, long-term use carries significant risks including cognitive decline, fall-related injuries, paradoxical excitation, and withdrawal syndromes. Reinforcement and neuroadaptation processes within the mesolimbic dopamine system contribute to BZD addiction, especially with chronic exposure. Regulatory responses include Schedule IV classification under the Controlled Substances Act and FDA black box warnings. Despite declining prescription rates in recent years, misuse, including nonmedical use and use of illicit designer BZDs, remains prevalent, especially among older adults and those with comorbid psychiatric or substance use disorders. Pharmacogenomic studies have identified genetic polymorphisms in hepatic enzymes (e.g., Cyp2c19 and Cyp3a4) and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits (e.g. Gabra2) that may influence BZD metabolism, efficacy, and addiction vulnerability, suggesting potential for personalized medicine approaches. In conclusion, the dual nature of BZDs, as essential tools in acute care and potential contributors to substance use disorders, demands a balanced, evidence-informed approach. Continued research, improved prescriber education, and integration of genetic insights into clinical care may help mitigate harm while preserving therapeutic benefit.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Rationale Chronic migraine is characterized by persistent trigeminal sensitization and neuroinflammation. however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its maintenance and mediate the therapeutic effects of acupuncture remian incompletely understood. Method A chronic migraine–like state was induced in mice by repeated dural inflammatory soup (IS), followed by electroacupuncture (EA). Behavioral hypersensitivity was assessed, and molecular changes in the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Sp5C) were analyzed using transcriptomic, biochemical, and functional approaches. Result Repeated inflammatory stimulation markedly increased CXCL13 and CXCR5 expression and ERK phosphorylation in the Sp5C, accompanied by mechanical allodynia, thermal hyperalgesia, glial activation, and elevated IL-6 and CCL2 levels. EA significantly attenuated pain hypersensitivity and reduced CXCL13/CXCR5 expression, ERK activation, glial reactivity, and inflammatory mediator release. EA also decreased migraine-related neuropeptides and synaptic plasticity markers, including substance P, PACAP, and NR2B. Functional manipulation experiments demonstrated bidirectional regulation of pain behaviors by CXCR5, establishing its causal role in chronic migraine–like sensitization. MicroRNA profiling identified a dysregulated miRNA signature converging on the transcription factor FOXO3, which indirectly regulated CXCR5 transcription, defining a miRNA–FOXO3–CXCR5 regulatory pathway. Conclusion Our study reveals the CXCL13/CXCR5/ERK axis as a previously unrecognized pathway in migraine neuroinflammation and demonstrates electroacupuncture's multimodal therapeutic mechanisms. These findings provide: (1) novel mechanistic insights into migraine pathophysiology through CXCR5-mediated signaling, and (2) translational implications for chronic migraine treatment by targeting the CXCL13/CXCR5/ERK axis. This work establishes a foundation for future development of targeted therapies and validates electroacupuncture as a viable intervention for migraine management.",

In Egypt, ALV-J has been actively monitored in various breeder flocks. This study investigated 200 eggs from ALV-J positive breeders, confirmed positive-polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-ALV-J, collected from a hatchery between January 2022 and December 2023. 200 tissue specimens (liver, heart, spleen, kidney, and lung) were collected from suspected embryos for PCR test, immunopathological identification, and sequencing analysis. To the best of our understanding, this is the first study specifically detecting ALV-J infection in chicken embryos in Egypt. The current study focuses on the genetic evolution and sequencing analysis of ALV-J isolates from chicken embryos across three Egyptian governorates: El-Sharkia, Al-Qalyubiya, and New Valley. Postmortem findings of the infected embryos showed stunting, curling, dwarfing, hemorrhagic body surface, enlarged liver, and congestion of chorio-allantoic membranes (CAM). Histopathological observation demonstrated no lymphoid or myeloid cell infiltrations, only degenerative changes and congestion of the examined organs existed. The immunohistochemical staining confirmed that the viral-positive signals were visceral tissues as the spleen, liver, and kidney. Only 30 samples were PCR-positive for ALV-J gp85 gene at size of 545 base pairs with a prevalence rate of 15%. Two ALV-J positive samples were sequenced and deposited in the Genbank under accession numbers (PQ119499 - PQ119500, ALV-J-II). ALV-J- gp85 gene phylogeny showed that the AlQalyubiya-1-EGYALVJ-env isolate is highly genetically correlated to Chinese strains (KJ179914-ALV-J-GD27, KJ179912-ALV-J-GD19, KJ179911-ALV-J-GD31) with nucleotide and amino acid identities of 98–100%; respectively. Moreover, Newvalley-2-EGYALVJ-env isolate is close similar to previous mentioned Chinese strains with nucleotide identity percentages of 98% and amino acid identity percentage 97%, 96%, 96%; respectively. This study confirmed that our two ALV-J isolates are not completely similar to the current Egyptian isolates. Also, ALV-J infection was continuously distributed in the breeders and considered one of the factors contributing to the tumor epidemics.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives This systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of non-technical skills (NTS) training for healthcare professionals working in emergency departments (EDs) and assessed the certainty of the evidence. Methods Peer-reviewed studies of NTS training for ED staff, including physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals, were systematically identified from PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, with supplementary searches of Google Scholar and reference lists (search date: 19 August 2025). Eligible studies reported learning outcomes, observed behavioural performance, and/or patient- or process-level outcomes in ED settings. Two reviewers independently screened records, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using RoB 2 for randomised controlled trials, ROBINS-I for non-randomised comparative studies, and the NIH/NHLBI tool for before-and-after studies. Owing to methodological heterogeneity, findings were synthesised narratively, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach (PROSPERO: CRD420251181995). Results Of 6,359 records identified, 15 studies met inclusion criteria, comprising two randomised controlled trials, one quasi-experimental study with a control group, and twelve before-and-after studies, predominantly from single-centre adult EDs in North America, Europe, and Asia. NTS training was commonly delivered through simulation-based courses with structured debriefing and was associated with consistent pre- to post-training improvements in knowledge, teamwork attitudes, and self-confidence, with low to moderate certainty of evidence. Behavioural performance improved across study designs, including more frequent closed-loop communication, clearer role allocation and prioritisation, improved situational awareness, and higher teamwork ratings measured using validated instruments such as the Team Emergency Assessment Measure (TEAM) and the Trauma Non-Technical Skills scale (T-NOTECHS) (moderate certainty). Evidence for clinical or process outcomes was limited but generally favourable in single-centre studies, including shorter resuscitation times and improved protocol adherence; no study reported effects on mortality or complication rates, and the certainty of evidence for these outcomes was rated as low to very low. Conclusion NTS training for ED teams improves learning outcomes and observable team performance, particularly when simulation is combined with high-quality debriefing and brief in-situ refreshers. Evidence for effects on patient outcomes remains limited. Future research should prioritise pragmatic multi-site designs with blinded video-based assessment and pre-specified process and patient endpoints.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Trypanosoma cruzi , the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, is transmitted via the dejections of triatomine insects such as Triatoma infestans. Parasite development inside the vector depends on temperature, which determines the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) and modulates the parasite load. As global warming is expected to increase mean temperatures and thermal variability, these shifts may influence vector competence. Methods Triatoma infestans individuals were experimentally infected with T. cruzi Dm28c strain and then exposed to four thermal regimes: two constant (18 °C and 27 °C) and two fluctuating (18 ± 5 °C and 27 ± 5 °C). Parasite load in the dejection samples was quantified by quantitative PCR over 42 days and the time to the first positive dejection determined to estimate the EIP. Results Higher temperatures significantly shortened the EIP, with mean values of 18.6 days at 18 ± 0 °C, 17.3 days at 18 ± 5 °C, 9.6 days at 27 ± 0 °C and 11.0 days at 27 ± 5 °C. Temperature variability did not affect the EIP but it did increase parasite load under cold conditions. Parasite load showed a bell-shaped curve, peaking earlier and at higher levels at warmer temperatures. A larger volume of ingested blood also reduced the EIP, especially under cold treatments. Conclusions Rising temperatures accelerate T. cruzi development within T. infestans , potentially enhancing vector competence under climate change scenarios. Although temperature variability did not affect the EIP, it increased parasite load, particularly under cold conditions, which is a relevant result considering that low temperatures have historically limited the vector and Chagas disease transmission. Temperature variability—not only mean warming—can modulate parasite development. Our results therefore provide novel and relevant insights into how climate change may alter vector-borne disease dynamics. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Increased thoracic kyphosis (TK) in adolescence can negatively affect posture, balance, and quality of life (QoL). While conventional corrective exercises (CE) are commonly used, Dynamic Neuromuscular Stabilization (DNS), based on developmental kinesiology, has shown potential as a targeted intervention. This study aims to compare the effects of DNS and conventional CE on TK angle, dynamic balance, and QoL in adolescent boys with increased TK. Methods In this single-blind randomized controlled trial, 60 male adolescents aged 14–16 years with increased TK were randomly assigned to three groups: DNS, conventional CE, or control. The DNS and CE group completed six sessions per week (three supervised and three home-based) for 8 weeks and control group continues their normal life. TK angle was measured using a Spinal Mouse device, dynamic balance was assessed with the Y-Balance Test, and QoL was evaluated using the SF-36 questionnaire. Results Analysis revealed that both the DNS and conventional exercise (CE) groups showed statistically significant improvements in all measured outcomes, including thoracic kyphosis (TK) angle, dynamic balance, and quality of life (QoL) compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, while the DNS group demonstrated significantly greater improvements than the CE group in TK angle and dynamic balance (p &lt; 0.05), the difference in QoL between the two intervention groups was not statistically significant. Conclusion DNS exercises were more effective than conventional CE in improving posture, balance, and QoL in adolescents with increased TK.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to determine the effects of a four-week running-based high-intensity interval training (HIIT) intervention on the reactive strength index (RSI) and motor abilities in youth football players. In this context, the contributions of the running-based HIIT protocol HIIT protocol, implemented in addition to regular football training, were evaluated on performance indicators such as speed, back strength, change of direction (COD), and countermovement jump (CMJ). This study aims to contribute to the development of scientifically grounded training programs to support performance improvement in youth football players. Methods A quantitative research design was employed in this study, specifically a randomized pretest–posttest controlled experimental design. Twenty male youth football players, aged 11–13 years, who voluntarily participated in the study were randomly allocated to either the experimental group (EG; n = 10) or the control group (CON; n = 10). The EG participated in a running-based HIIT program three times per week for four weeks by replacing a low-to-moderate-intensity technical–tactical segment of their regular football training, whereas the CON continued with only regular football training during this period without any additional training volume. The players underwent RSI, 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m sprint tests, back strength tests, the Illinois Agility Test, and CMJ tests both before the training sessions and at the end of the four-week intervention. Results According to the repeated-measures ANOVA results, pretest values did not differ significantly between the groups ( p &gt; .05). Over the 4-week period, significant improvements with large effect sizes were observed in RSI, sprint performance (10, 20, 30 m), back strength, COD, and CMJ tests ( p &lt; .05; ηp² = 0.29–0.55). Significant group × time interactions were also detected for all variables, again with large effect sizes ( p &lt; .05; ηp² = 0.20–0.30), indicating greater improvements in the EG compared to the CON. However, despite these favourable within-group changes, between-group post-test comparisons did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions This study revealed that a 4-week HIIT intervention applied to youth male football players had positive effects on the RSI and motor abilities, as evidenced by large within-group improvements and significant group × time interactions, despite the absence of statistically significant between-group post-test differences. These findings suggest that HIIT protocols should be integrated into training programs as an effective strategy to improve explosive strength, COD, and overall functional performance in young athletes. Trial registration This randomized controlled trial was retrospectively registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN45188963) on 16 July 2025 due to administrative delays during ethics approval and registry processing.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The escalating threat of antibiotic resistance, along with the global rise in cancer incidence and oxidative stress-related disorders, underscores the urgent need for a continuous identification of novel antimicrobial drugs, anticancer treatments, and antioxidant compounds. Actinomycetes isolated from soil are recognized for generating secondary metabolites with novel bioactivities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and anticancer properties. Results Molecular identification revealed that the predominant isolate belonged to the Streptomyces enissocaesilis SMS712 (Accession number PV464955). The S. enissocaesilis SMS712 extract demonstrated notable antibacterial activity, showing the highest inhibition zone (14.33 ± 1.53 mm) against Escherichia coli , while no antifungal activity was detected against the tested fungal species. The S. enissocaesilis SMS712 extract showed moderate antioxidant activity, ranging from 37% to 53.3%. Anticancer activity was evaluated against two cell lines, MCF-7 and HCT-16, yielding IC 50 values ranging from 21.9 µg/mL to 59.2 µg/mL. TLC separation followed by ¹H NMR analysis revealed four bioactive compounds from S. enissocaesilis SMS712 with antimicrobial, anticancer, and antioxidant activities. The identified compounds − 2-Methylhexadecan-1-ol, (Z)-13-Docosenamide, 2-Ethyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol, and (Z)-9-Octadecenoic acid - were further supported by molecular docking analyses, suggesting their therapeutic mechanisms. Conclusions This study highlights S. enissocaesilis SMS712 as a promising source for novel agents against antibiotic resistance, oxidative stress, and cancer. Graphical abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective observing the clinical effects of dust mite sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) on children with asthma, changes of Th17 / Treg cells and related cytokines in order to investigate the possible pathological mechanism of immune tolerance induced by SLIT. Methods Sixty children with asthma allergic to dust mites were included, divided into SLIT group ( n = 30) and non-SLIT group ( n = 30). Clinical symptoms of asthma in each group had been scored before, 1 year and 2 years after treatment. Meanwhile we also evaluated the proportion of Th17 and CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells in peripheral blood using flow cytometry. Besides, cell culture supernatant was collected to detect the changes of IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17 levels. Results We found that in SLIT group, asthma symptom and drug use score, Th17 cell percentages, IL-6 and IL-17 levels have significantly decreased throughout the study period ( p &lt; 0.05), while FEV1%, Treg cell percentages and IL-10 level have prominently increased throughout the study period ( p &lt; 0.05). By contrast, in non-SLIT group, asthma symptom score, lung function, Th17 cell percentages, IL-6 and IL-17 levels have all significantly improved, but on the whole lower than SLIT group ( p &lt; 0.05). However, we have observed no statistical differences in drug use score, Treg cell percentages, IL-10 level for non-SLIT group throughout the study period. Conclusions SLIT of Dust mite drops could change T immune cell profiles whereas improve asthma symptoms. SLIT might reverse the functional imbalance of Th 17 / Treg cells and induce immune tolerance by upregulating Treg cell function and downregulating Th17 cell function.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background WHIM syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant primary immunodeficiency characterized by the classical tetrad of warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis. The majority of cases are associated with gain-of-function mutations in the CXCR4 gene. Recent studies have expanded the clinical spectrum of the disease, revealing that only a subset of patients present with all four hallmark features. This underscores the syndrome’s variable expression and the need for greater clinical awareness of its atypical forms. Case presentation We report a case of a 6-year-old Saudi girl who presented with persistent neutropenia, recurrent upper respiratory infections, and an episode of thrombocytopenia following a dental procedure. She did not exhibit warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, or myelokathexis. Immunological workup revealed marked lymphopenia affecting T, B, and NK cells, while immunoglobulin levels remained within normal limits. Bone marrow findings were unremarkable. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous de novo CXCR4 frameshift mutation (c.1172_1173del), confirming the diagnosis of WHIM syndrome. The patient was clinically stable and managed conservatively with precautions. Conclusion This case contributes to the evolving understanding of the clinical variability in WHIM syndrome and highlights the importance of genetic testing in patients with unexplained neutropenia and recurrent infections, even in the absence of the complete clinical tetrad.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Various neurological diseases can cause rapidly progressive dementia, which is a clinical syndrome characterized by a rapid decline in cognitive function over a short period, typically less than 1 or 2 years. It can be caused by various neurological diseases, including neurodegenerative, inflammatory, vascular, metabolic, and neoplastic central nervous system diseases. Rapidly progressive dementia is particularly associated with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, but other conditions such as immune-mediated encephalitis, rapidly progressive subtypes of Alzheimer’s disease, and various other mimics of prion diseases must also be considered. Multiple cerebral microbleeds are typical imaging features of cerebral small vessel diseases, but can also appear in other rare conditions. Case presentation We describe the case of a 45-year-old Asian female patient with lung adenocarcinoma who exhibited rapidly progressive dementia and multiple cerebral microbleeds. The patient was a 45-year-old woman who experienced rapid cognitive decline without obvious triggers, accompanied by disorganized speech, difficulty in expression, and short-term memory loss. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed widely distributed microhemorrhages, while computed tomography and pathological examination further confirmed the diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma. The patient did not undergo a brain biopsy because of the rapid deterioration of her illness. Her condition deteriorated rapidly, leading to death in the fourth month. Conclusion Herein, we discuss the presence of the apolipoprotein ε4 allele risk gene and the role of the tumor in causing multiple nodular lesions in the patient’s brain, as well as multiple microbleeds. The role of the apolipoprotein ε4 allele risk gene in multiple nodular lesions of the brain and CMB requires further study, as it may be responsible for the rapid cognitive decline and imaging findings observed in patients. The role of the tumor in causing these brain lesions and cerebral microbleeds is also of interest as it may help to provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of rapidly progressive dementia in the context of cancer. This case highlights the need for a comprehensive diagnosis, including magnetic resonance imaging, blood and cerebrospinal fluid analyses, and brain biopsy, to identify treatable causes of rapidly progressive dementia.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The ancient DMRT family of transcription factors has been proposed as evolutionarily conserved effectors of sexual differentiation. While brain sexual differentiation has traditionally been attributed to a paracrine role of steroid hormones and intrinsic cues directly controlled by sex chromosomes, the downstream effector mechanisms remain elusive. To elucidate the role of Dmrts in mammalian brain sexual differentiation, we generated a comprehensive expression atlas for all family members in the mouse brain using in situ hybridization across sexes and development (E12.5, E14.5, E18.5, adulthood and, sometimes, P7). We found that all Dmrts , except Dmrt7 , were expressed in the brain. This study expands understanding of the DMA- Dmrt subfamily beyond pallial structures and identifies their expression maintenance in adult neurogenic sites. For the first time, we described the neuronal expression of Dmrt2 and Dmrt6 . Mouse Dmrts did not show clear sexually dimorphic patterns, but did show quantitative expression differences between sexes. Most Dmrts were maintained in postmitotic neurons during embryonic and postnatal stages, suggesting potential interactions with gonadal sex hormones during organizational (perinatally, with testosterone peaking at E18.5 in males) and activational phases (after puberty, with androgens in males and estrogens in females). Our analysis of Dmrt5 expression revealed its prominent presence in the mouse olfactory system. The olfactory system shows sex differences and is fundamental for controlling sex-specific innate behaviors in rodents. Thus, it represents an ideal scenario to test, as a proof of concept, the role of Dmrts in the sexual differentiation of the mammalian brain. The absence of Dmrt5 similarly affected the main olfactory epithelium, where sensory neurons reside, in both sexes; however, cell number-related defects in the olfactory bulb and piriform cortex differed between male and female embryos, revealing Dmrt5 interaction with sex in deeper layers of innate neural circuits. Our results provide a valuable resource for uncovering novel sites and mechanisms of sexual differentiation in the mammalian nervous system, potentially contributing to sex biases observed in psychiatric and neurological disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Streptococcus suis is a zoonotic pathogen that poses a significant threat to both the swine industry and human health. This bacterium utilizes a type VII secretion system (T7SS) to translocate effector proteins that mediate bacterial competition and contribute to virulence. However, the functions of T7SS effectors in S. suis remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified and characterized LXG-T2, a T7SS-secreted toxin from S. suis virulent strain WUSS351. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that LXG-T2 harbors a C-terminal glycine zipper motif, a structural feature commonly associated with membrane-disrupting toxins. Functional assays demonstrated that LXG-T2 exhibits strong bactericidal activity against E. coli and provides S. suis with a competitive advantage. Furthermore, the LXG-T2 has the capacity to compromise the integrity of bacterial membranes, as evidenced by the observed increase in membrane permeability and depolarization in target cells. Moreover, LXG-T2 exhibited cytotoxic effects on host cells and promoted S. suis survival in a murine infection model. Collectively, our findings establish LXG-T2 as a T7SS effector mediated membrane disruption to enhance both bacterial competition and virulence. This work not only reveals a novel mechanism by which S. suis manipulates microbial communities, but also highlights the significance of T7SS effectors as key mediators of pathogenesis in Gram-positive bacteria.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In the realm of image and vision computing, shape recognition remains challenging due to intra-class variations that can degrade performance. To address this, we propose an enhanced shape recognition method leveraging dual constraint reduction and adaptive orthogonal wavelet transform (ADCR). Firstly, we refine shape contours by reducing salient points to strong feature points (bone points), mitigating the impact of shape deformation. Secondly, we employ an adaptive orthogonal wavelet transform to ensure scale and mirror invariance, significantly accelerating recognition speed. Thirdly, we streamline the feature structure after wavelet transformation, retaining only minimum, mean, and maximum eigenvectors for efficient shape representation. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a MAP score of 79.2% on the ICL dataset with an average recognition time of 26.9 ms, outperforming similar methods by over 200 times in efficiency. Our ADCR method significantly enhances shape recognition capabilities.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The implementation of interventions in clinical practices is a challenge in healthcare settings, particularly in the field of habilitation. Although research on interventions in this area has increased, research on the implementation of these interventions has been slow. Exploring staff experience of implementation is therefore crucial to optimize the likelihood that interventions will be adopted and sustained in habilitation settings. The purpose of this systematic review is to synthesize the experiences of staff in implementing interventions for adults with congenital disabilities into a comprehensive overview. Methods Studies were included if they provided empirical data on staff experiences of implementing interventions for adults with congenital disabilities in health and social care settings, regardless of study design. Non-empirical studies and grey literature were excluded. Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology, we conducted a search using the Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Sociological Abstract, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts (ASSIA), and Web of Science databases. The last search update was conducted in February 2024. The Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) tool was used for qualitative studies, and the Mixed-Method Assessment Tool (MMAT) for the quantitative and mixed-method studies. The Convergent Integrated Approach (CIA) was employed to synthesize the data. Results Of the 5855 studies initially retrieved, eight met the inclusion criteria. The analysis and integration of all included studies were categorized into three themes: (1) conditions for implementation, (2) acceptability of the intervention, and (3) approaches for change. The results underscore the importance of organizational resources, vision, and collaboration in successful implementation. Conclusions Active participation of professionals and alignment of interventions with existing practices were identified as key factors for success. The consideration of external factors that can influence the implementation of interventions is also important. In general, these findings provide information to guide future planning and implementation of interventions within habilitation settings.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Plant litter input plays an important role in controlling soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover and the flow of carbon (C) among different pools. However, the relative effects of aboveground and belowground root litter on soil aggregate C dynamics across different forest types and along climate gradients remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined changes in soil aggregate mass proportion, litter-derived and native C contents of macro-aggregate, micro-aggregate and silt + clay fractions, and C flow among these fractions during 2 years of litter input, using 13 C isotope tracing technique in tropical, temperate and boreal forests along a climate gradient in China. Results The results showed that belowground root litter input enhanced soil aggregation across all three forests, but aboveground litter input had no significant effect. Belowground root litter input increased total and litter-derived C content across aggregate fractions compared to aboveground litter input in the tropical forest, while it decreased native C content in the same forest. However, the effects of litter input on total and litter-derived C contents were minimal in the boreal and temperate forests. In addition, patterns of soil C flow among aggregates varied depending on both litter input type and forest type. Conclusions Our results imply that belowground root litter enhances soil aggregation and aggregate C turnover compared to aboveground litter input. Moreover, the effects of root litter input on soil aggregate C turnover and C flow depend on forest types along the climatic gradient.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study explores crop diversification (CD) in smallholder farming systems in the coastal zone of the Ganges Delta in southern Bangladesh, which faces significant environmental challenges such as drought, erratic rainfall, soil salinity, waterlogging, and cyclones. These factors undermine agricultural sustainability and contribute to poverty and food insecurity. This research examines how environmental, farm resource, and socioeconomic factors influence CD across 200 farms in the Barguna, Khulna, and Patuakhali districts of Bangladesh. The Herfindahl index was used to measure crop diversity, showing an average value of 0.36, indicating moderate concentration and relatively high diversity, although half of the farmers exhibited higher values. The Fractional Probit model findings show that environmental factors such as reduced waterlogging and soil salinity positively influenced CD, while farm resources like access to irrigation, number of land parcels, and access to machinery facilitated greater diversity. Socioeconomic factors, such as greater distance from markets and the availability of hired labour, also promoted CD, but seasonal migration of the household head and low household savings hindered it. The study found that Khulna exhibited greater CD, while tidal flooding limited agricultural potential in Patuakhali district . The study recommends improving environmental and socioeconomic conditions in Bangladesh’s coastal farming systems through targeted soil rehabilitation, drainage and irrigation, expansion of water infrastructure and harvesting solutions, and improving access to affordable mechanisation. Strengthening rural infrastructure and financial tools, such as crop insurance and low-interest loans, will enhance resilience, farm incomes, and long-term sustainability. Tailored strategies are recommended for the Khulna and Patuakhali districts to support region-specific cropping systems and diversification.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The gayal ( Bos frontalis ), a semi-domesticated bovine species, demonstrates exceptional adaptability to lignocellulose-rich diets dominated by bamboo, suggesting the presence of a specialized gastrointestinal microbiome. However, the functional mechanisms underlying this host-microbiome interaction remain poorly understood. Here, we conducted integrated metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses of rumen, cecum, and colon digesta from yellow cattle and gayal raised on the same bamboo-based high-fiber diet. Results The results showed that gayal exhibited superior fiber-degrading capacity relative to yellow cattle, evidenced by significantly higher ( P &lt; 0.05) fiber digestibility, cellulase and xylanase activities, and increased volatile fatty acids production despite identical feed intake. Microbial community analysis revealed distinct composition in both the rumen and hindgut of gayal compared to yellow cattle, with notable enrichment of taxa specialized in lignocellulose degradation. Metatranscriptomic profiling further identified upregulation of key lignin-modification enzymes, particularly AA6, AA2, and AA3, primarily encoded by Prevotella , Cryptobacteroides , Limimorpha , and Ventricola . These enzymes are known to modify lignin structure to increase polysaccharide accessibility. These results demonstrate that gayal hosts a unique and metabolically active gastrointestinal microbiome capable of efficient lignocellulose deconstruction through a coordinated enzymatic cascade, especially effective in dismantling lignin barriers. Conclusions This study provides novel insights into host-microbiome co-adaptation to fibrous feeds and highlights the potential of gayal-derived microbial consortia and enzymes for improving roughage utilization in ruminant agriculture.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract While early childhood remains a formative period for healthy child development, it is simultaneously a time when parents experience increased mental health challenges. Such increased challenges (e.g., heightened parental stress, anxiety, depression, etc.) can lead to a variety of adverse child outcomes, including increased risk of externalizing and internalizing disorders. Despite the well-documented effects of parental mental health on child development, Canadian families face a plethora of barriers to accessing services in a timely manner, and as such, low-barrier, accessible mental health supports are needed. In an effort to increase available services to Canadian families, the current study translates the BEAM program (Building Emotional Awareness and Mental Health; thebeamprogram.com), a previously established online parenting and mental health app, into LightBEAM a massive open online intervention (MOOI). By translating an efficacious intervention into a MOOI format, we hope to increase accessibility, scalability, and reach of the program in an effort to better support Canadian families. To investigate the efficacy of translating BEAM into LightBEAM, a pilot waitlist control design will be utilized. Canadian families who are parenting a child between the ages of 1.5 and 8 years old and who are experiencing elevated symptoms of parenting stress, anxiety, depression, and/or anger will be recruited. When moving through the intervention arm of the trial, participants will have access to an app that houses 12 weeks of parenting and mental health videos, a group forum, and weekly exercises to reinforce key skills learned. A combination of Multilevel modeling and mediation models will be utilized to assess changes in participants' elevated mental health scores across the 12-week program and the 6-month follow-up period. Additionally, post-program focus groups will be conducted to further explore the feasibility and acceptability of the program. The translation of BEAM into LightBEAM, a national MOOI, has the potential to increase the scalability of this intervention to ensure that Canadian families have access to timely mental health and parenting supports. Results will be used to inform future iterations of the program. This trial was retrospectively registered with ClinicalTrial.gov NCT07026838 on June 10th, 2025{4}.

    "Abstract": "Relationship science emphasises that most people desire romantic relationships. Self-determination theory provides a theoretical approach that can capture the variety of motivations potentially underlying the pursuit of romantic relationships. Within this framework, couple and sexual motivations can help us to understand why people are in relationships, what motivates them to stay together and what can increase the risk of conflict. Indeed, how couples manage conflict can explain personal and couples' well-being within close relationships. Grounded in self-determination theory, a Structural Equation Model was tested to investigate the role of couple and sexual motivation by both partners in associating couple and individual well-being by both. We also examined whether conflict engagement played an intervening role in associations of motivation with well-being. 402 heterosexual young adult couples, aged 20 to 30, who had been in a stable relationship for between 1 and 5 years, participated in the study via a snowball recruitment technique. Using the Actor Partner Interdependence Model (APIM), results showed that couple motivation in both partners is positively related to their own couple and individual well-being. Female sexual motivation is positively related to their own individual well-being. An indirect association is found in both partners between couple motivation and individual well-being through the mediation of conflict engagement. In line with SDT, motivation emerges as a critical factor in the promotion of both individual and couple well-being and in the adoption of functional conflict resolution strategies. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings for future research and interventions are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Sepsis is a critical determinant of mortality in critical patients. Antithrombin (AT) plays a pivotal role as a serine protease inhibitor with dual anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory functions, yet its precise role in prognostic stratification remains undefined. This study aimed to investigate the association between AT activity and clinical outcomes in sepsis and to identify critical prognostic thresholds. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 222 septic patients from the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-III databases. AT activity was measured within the first 24 h following sepsis diagnosis, with the primary outcome defined as 28-day all-cause mortality. For preliminary description, AT activity was categorized into tertiles. The primary analysis utilized restricted cubic splines (RCS) to model the dose–response relationship and identify risk thresholds. Multivariable Cox regression models were employed to adjust for demographics, comorbidities, and SOFA score. Subgroup and survival analyses were performed to evaluate effect modification and visualize outcome differences across threshold-defined risk groups. To visually compare survival outcomes between patient groups defined by the RCS-derived risk thresholds, we generated Kaplan–Meier curves and employed log-rank tests. Results A non-linear relationship between AT activity and 28-day mortality was identified, with a marked increase in risk observed below approximately 55% in the overall cohort. Patients with AT activity &lt; 55% had significantly higher 28-day mortality (34.2% vs. 14.4%, p = 0.001), ICU mortality (33.3% vs. 9.0%, p &lt; 0.001), and incidences of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (22.5% vs. 3.6%, p &lt; 0.001) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (78.4% vs. 62.2%, p = 0.013). Subgroup analysis revealed a significant interaction with hypertension. In the hypertensive subgroup, a similarly elevated risk zone was observed below approximately 64% AT activity. Hypertensive patients below this level had markedly increased 28-day mortality (42.3% vs. 9.62%, p &lt; 0.001), ICU mortality (38.5% vs. 5.77%, p &lt; 0.001), and incidences of DIC (19.2% vs. 1.92%, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Reduced AT activity was significantly associated with higher mortality and organ dysfunction in sepsis. Risk thresholds were observed at approximately 55% for the overall cohort and 64% among hypertensive patients. Patients below these levels exhibited significantly increased mortality and higher incidences of DIC and AKI. These findings support AT activity as a prognostic biomarker for risk stratification and highlight its potential to inform future management strategies for high-risk patients.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Antioxidant peptides (AOPs), with their strong free radical scavenging ability and health benefits, have emerged as promising candidates for disease prevention and food preservation. However, traditional experimental approaches to AOP discovery remain hindered by inefficiencies and substantial resource demands. Here, we present Multi-AOP, a parameter lightweight multi-view deep learning framework (0.75 million parameters) that enhances AOP discovery through integrated sequence and graph learning. We employ Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) to generate sequence embeddings. Concurrently, we transform peptide sequences into SMILES representations and extract molecular graph features using a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN), capturing intrinsic physicochemical properties. By leveraging both sequence patterns and structural information through hierarchical fusion, Multi-AOP achieves accuracies of 0.8043, 0.9684, and 0.9043 on the AnOxPePred, AnOxPP, and AOPP benchmark datasets, respectively, consistently outperforming conventional machine learning algorithms and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Furthermore, we constructed a unified AOP dataset by integrating these benchmark datasets, facilitating the future development of generalizable AOP models. All datasets and the optimized predictive model are publicly accessible at https://github.com/CaiJianxiu/Multi-AOP .",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Glaucoma filtration surgery (GFS) often fails because of excessive scar formation driven by inflammation and fibroblast activation. Although the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway is involved in inflammatory responses, its role in post-surgical fibrosis remains unclear. Methods A mouse GFS model was established in wild-type (WT) and STING-knockout (STING-KO) animals. A parallel cohort of WT mice received a single intraoperative subconjunctival injection of the STING inhibitor H151. Bleb survival, intraocular pressure, histopathology, collagen deposition, and inflammatory/fibrotic markers were evaluated for 28 days. RNA sequencing, Western blotting, and ELISA were employed to profile the p38/MAPK axis. Primary human Tenon’s capsule fibroblasts were treated with angiotensin II in the presence or absence of STING silencing or H151 to corroborate mechanisms in vitro. Results STING expression was markedly up-regulated in fibroblasts within human and mice post-GFS tissues. STING-KO mice exhibited prolonged bleb survival together with reduced collagen deposition and fibroblast activation. RNA-sequencing revealed that STING deletion significantly altered the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Mechanistically, STING deficiency suppressed p38 MAPK phosphorylation, leading to decreased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-18, and IL-1β, as well as the fibrogenic factors α-SMA, collagen I, fibronectin, connective tissue growth factor, and collagen type III alpha 1 at the surgical sites. Consistently, the selective STING inhibitor H151 recapitulated these effects by suppressing p38 MAPK signaling and markedly reducing fibrotic scarring. Conclusions STING deficiency alleviates scar formation after GFS by suppressing p38 MAPK pathway. Targeting STING/p38 axis may improve surgical outcomes by modulating the balance between inflammation and tissue repair.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Extensive research acknowledges the vital role institutional investors play in fostering venture growth and organizational development toward innovation-driven sustainability. However, how institutional ownership affects corporate innovation is still under debate. This paper proposes that institutional ownership may exhibit a curvilinear, rather than linear, impact on corporate innovation performance, due to the paradoxical dynamics between resource superiority and capital myopia. Such tension is particularly salient in transitional markets undergoing significant institutional reforms and thus grappling with sustainability challenges. By employing a panel dataset of 1,884 publicly listed firms in China, the empirical results provide robust support that institutional ownership exerts an inverted U-shaped effect on innovation patenting. Moreover, this relationship is positively moderated by executive remuneration and market uncertainty, whereas institutional uncertainty has a negative moderating effect. Post hoc and mechanism analyses generate further evidence that the curving impact of institutional ownership on R&amp;D contributes to the concave curvilinear relationship with innovation performance. This study elucidates why institutional financing represents a mixed blessing for corporate innovation and how this relationship is contingent upon varying degrees of executive incentives and external uncertainty, facilitating a more nuanced understanding of institutional investment. In this way, this paper offers valuable insights for executives, firms, and policymakers seeking to harness the potential of institutional investors in corporate innovation and sustainability.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Sustainable finance can provide financial assistance to address environmental challenges. Nevertheless, whether sustainable finance can help facilitate low-carbon urban advancement remains an unaddressed topic. Using panel data from 271 cities in China from 2011 to 2019, we investigate the impact of sustainable finance on carbon emission efficiency and draw the following conclusions. First, sustainable finance may considerably strengthen the efficiency of carbon emissions via three transmission channels: economic growth, industrial upgrading, and technical innovation. Second, from two viewpoints, the “dual-carbon” aim and digital empowerment, our findings demonstrate the beneficial moderating impact of environmental and low-carbon regulations, the digital economy, and digital technology in the process of sustainable finance to increase carbon emissions efficiency. Furthermore, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that the favorable influence of sustainable finance on carbon emission efficiency is more visible in nonresource-based cities, high-level cities, low-carbon cities, pilot cities with carbon trading rights, two control zones, and cities with environmental legislation. Further analysis reveals a nonlinear link between the influence of sustainable finance and carbon emission efficiency. The findings provide new ideas for accelerating the realization of China’s “dual-carbon” goal as well as lessons for policymaking in developing countries.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Reward-based crowdfunding (RBC) has emerged as a transformative model in entrepreneurial finance, offering an alternative avenue for project funding and engagement. However, systematic exploration is lacking. This study provides a comprehensive examination of RBC through a hybrid review combining bibliometric analysis of 154 articles and a systematic in-depth content analysis of 63 articles. The analysis identified key themes, including “crowdfunding success factors”, “backer motivations and behavior”, “marketing and promotion strategies”, “warards and incentives”, “project outcomes and ecosystem impact,” and “challenges and barriers.” The findings emphasize the critical role of communication, strategic reward design, and social media engagement in campaign success. Additionally, the study highlighted the role of social capital, demographic influences, and the long-term benefits of crowdfunding for future venture capital investments. Practical implications include tailored guidance for entrepreneurs on optimizing campaign design and backer engagement; recommendations for platform developers on enhancing trust, transparency, and user experience; and policy insights that emphasize regulatory alignment, fraud prevention, and inclusive access. Specifically, the study recommends mandatory disclosures, standardized reward delivery guidelines, and streamlined campaign procedures to support a robust and sustainable crowdfunding ecosystem. However, the study’s scope is limited to English-language, peer-reviewed journal articles indexed up to Q1 2023, which may exclude nonindexed or region-specific perspectives. Future research should explore cross-cultural factors, interdisciplinary approaches, and the integration of emerging technologies such as blockchain to further enhance RBC practices. These results contribute to refining RBC practices, supporting entrepreneurs, and shaping robust crowdfunding ecosystems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This mixed-methods study investigated the effects of different dictionary formats within Google Classroom on the translation performance and attitudes of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. One hundred twenty male EFL university students in Egypt were assigned to one of three groups: an online dictionary, a CD-ROM dictionary, or a traditional paper dictionary control. Quantitative analysis revealed that both digital dictionary groups significantly outperformed the paper-based control group in translation accuracy, confidence, and enjoyment. However, while no significant quantitative differences emerged between the two digital groups, qualitative findings revealed a stark experiential divide. Participants lauded the online dictionary for its comprehensive features and empowering user experience, which fostered confidence and enjoyment, while describing the CD-ROM as limited and frustrating. These findings demonstrate that while any digital integration surpasses traditional methods, the specific pedagogical affordances of a tool are paramount; statistical parity in performance can mask crucial differences in learner agency and motivation. This study concludes that in technology-enhanced translation pedagogy, selecting tools with superior usability and rich features is essential not only for improving performance but for cultivating the positive affective experiences that underpin sustainable learning.",

The model is adaptable to diverse maritime supply chain and utilizes performance indicators, such as queue length and total cycle time. A case study conducted at Itapoá Port, Brazil, indicates that the infrastructure can be used as an efficient congestion management strategy, since it has the potential to reduce the total cycle time of full containers by 15.69% for import flows and 18.43% for export flows.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background In the process of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, the interconversion between 3-phosphoglyceric acid (3-PGA) and 2-phosphoglyceric acid (2-PGA) is catalyzed by phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM). Previous research reports indicate that a subclass of the PGAM family, although having sequence homology with the typical PGAMs, lacks PGAM activity and instead participates in biological processes through other mechanisms. Understanding the role of VdPGAM1 in the growth and pathogenicity of Verticillium dahliae is essential for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying its pathogenicity. In this study, knockout and complementation mutants were successfully obtained through Agrobacterium -mediated transformation (ATMT) technology. Wild-type (WT), knockout mutants, and complementation mutants were all used to study the function of VdPGAM1 . Results Enzyme activity assays, pyruvate content measurement, and the utilization of different carbon sources all suggest that VdPGAM1 protein lacks PGAM activity. A series of experiments, including the glass paper penetration test, spore detection, and electron microscopy observation, demonstrate that VdPGAM1 is involved in mycelial growth, penetration, and spore production. The VdPGAM1 gene knockout mutant exhibits enhanced resistance to abiotic stress, with reduced microspore and melanin content, and enhanced resistance to oxidative stress. The yeast two-hybrid assay (Y2H) and the luciferase complementation imaging assay (LCI) demonstrated that VdPGAM1 can interact with the adhesion protein VdFAS1. Furthermore, these mutants displayed increased hydrophobicity and adhesion ability, suggesting that VdPGAM1 negatively regulates the pathogenicity of V. dahliae to cotton. Conclusion VdPGAM1 is involved in the growth of V. dahliae and its response to abiotic stress. Combining the results of the virulence assay, RNA sequencing, and Y2H experiments, we confirmed that VdPGAM1 negatively regulates virulence. Additionally, we hypothesized that the interaction between VdPGAM1 and the adhesin VdFAS1 might play a crucial role.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Packet classification is a cornerstone of network security functions, such as firewalls, access control, and network metering. It involves taking different actions on packets based on security rules to implement these network security functions. As networks continue to evolve and the number of network instances rapidly increases, the complexity and size of network security rule sets are also expanding. Additionally, autonomous defense systems with artificial intelligence that can detect and block online attacks have become a new trend in network security. Packet classifiers need to not only achieve fast rule matching under large rule sets but also support rapid rule updates in order to deploy security rules issued by online defense systems in a timely manner. However, existing packet classification methods struggle to balance lookup speed with update performance. To achieve rapid rule matching and support fast rule updates in networks, we propose a novel approach called the Learned Index Updatable Tree (LIPT) to address this challenge. LIPT partitions the rule set into single-field non-overlapping subsets and constructs dynamic learned index trees for each subset using keys obtained by sampling. To implement rule updates directly within the learned index tree without reconstruction, LIPT employs a gap array layout in the data nodes, which reserves space for rule insertion. To enhance lookup and update performance, LIPT addresses the challenge of direct range validation in the data node through payload-assisted validation, which helps quickly identify lookup and insertion locations. Furthermore, LIPT employs a simple linear regression model to construct the learned index tree, enabling swift lookup based on the predictive results of the linear regression model; it also utilizes a cost model to simplify the construction process. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LIPT’s performance, showing that both lookup and update speeds are significantly improved compared to existing algorithms that support rule updating. Compared to the benchmark algorithm PSTSS, LIPT’s update speed increases by 25%, and its classification speed increases by 242%.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Despite growing attention to wildland firefighter safety, little is known about the full scope of environmental health hazards experienced occupationally. Previous research has documented exposures to carcinogens and combustion byproducts from smoke, dust, ash, engine exhaust, ignition devices, and location-specific chemical and radiological hazards. With growing attention to firefighters’ health outcomes, more research is needed on the environmental health hazards that they experience routinely and non-routinely. Qualitative research is well suited for exploratory investigations of environmental hazards. This study draws on a long-term ethnographic research project with federal wildland firefighters in Oregon to identify the environmental health hazards that wildland firefighters experience. I took detailed fieldnotes during participant observation working as a wildland firefighter with federal engine and handcrews. I also shadowed an incident management team, attended relevant meetings and trainings, and conducted 22 semi-structured interviews. I analyzed all data in NVivo, a computer program for coding qualitative data. Results Wildland firefighters were aware of commonly identified hazards of their work, including smoke exposure, heat, and “human factors” such as fatigue and diet. Firefighters experience additional hazards that are rarely discussed. Routine but generally unacknowledged hazards include non-vegetation smoke, dust, chemicals in gear and equipment, and fuels and exhaust. Incident- and location-specific hazards include food and water quality concerns, hazards in government housing, and military, radiation, industrial, and mining hazards. Addressing these hazards is challenging because of both practical and cultural barriers. Conclusion This exploratory cataloguing of the environmental health hazards faced by wildland firefighters is unlikely to be surprising to firefighters themselves, yet most of these hazards are underrecognized by land management agencies and researchers, and are incompletely mitigated in the work environment. Many of these hazards are (largely) invisible to those not working on the fireline or are only discussed in isolation, rather than as part of a cumulative or holistic understanding of firefighter health and safety. More attention by fire management agencies, fire leadership, and researchers is needed to the full range of hazards experienced by wildland firefighters.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Fire is a critical ecosystem process for maintaining savannas globally, but how it affects tree growth is complex. Climate, a dominant driver of tree growth, may interact with fire to produce novel climate-growth relationships because of the way climate influences fire intensity and the role it plays in facilitating post-fire tree recovery. Understanding how fire and climate interact to influence tree growth is critical for managing longleaf pine ( Pinus palustris ) savannas, a fire-dependent ecosystem undergoing rapid environmental change. Results We analyzed annual basal area increment (BAI) from 453 longleaf pine tree core samples collected across eight sites spanning three community types in Florida to quantify how monthly and seasonal climatic variables influence tree growth, and how these relationships are modified by fire and fire seasonality. We found that maximum temperature and precipitation during late spring and summer and summer to fall PDSI were key drivers of growth, but their effects varied by site and were frequently altered by the occurrence of fire. Notably, at four of eight sites, fire reversed the direction of climate-growth relationships. Reversals are when a positive climate effect in non-fire years becomes negative in fire years, or vice versa. Reversals most commonly changed the effect of climatic variables on tree growth from positive to negative, though the direction varied across sites and seasons. Fire also strengthened the effect that climate had on growth at four sites. Tree growth was slightly reduced in fire years regardless of the season of fire, but these differences were not statistically significant, suggesting overall resilience of longleaf pine growth to fire occurrence. Conclusions Our findings show that tree growth in frequent-fire systems is shaped by complex interactions between climate and fire, and that fire can mediate or even reverse the effects of climate. Importantly, individual tree responses varied significantly across and within sites, pointing to high intraspecific variability likely driven by individual tree characteristics (size and age) and local site conditions including competition and management legacies. By incorporating individual-level growth data, this study underscores the need for fine-scale, context-specific fire management strategies that account for local climate and ecological variation across the longleaf pine range.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract While plant pathogens rely on their hosts for nutrients, the specific way they take these nutrients remains unclear. Recently, Wang et al. discovered that the bacterial type III effector AvrBs2 acts as a xanthosan synthetase, facilitating the transformation of uridine 5'-diphosphate-α-D-galactose into a sugar phosphodiester known as bis-(1,6)-cyclic dimeric α-D-galactose-phosphate, or xanthosan. When xanthosan is released from the plant’s cytoplasm into the apoplastic space, Xanthomonas species absorb it via the XanT transporter and break it down with the XanP phosphodiesterase to use as a source of nutrition. Overexpression of XanP in rice blocks the nutrient supply for Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola ( Xoc ), making the crop resistant to bacterial leaf streak disease.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Diagnosing functional seizures can be challenging, and the semiology may vary between pediatric and adult age groups. Identifying those variabilities may be of diagnostic value. This study aimed to compare the semiological characteristics of functional seizures in both the pediatric and adult populations. Methods All video ictal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings at Cairo University Epilepsy Unit (CUEU) from January 2021 to December 2023 were retrospectively reviewed for adults or children with functional seizures. Detailed semiological characteristics of the ictal events were analyzed independently by at least two epileptologists. Each event was listed under the classification system as either major motor, minor motor, dialeptic, non-epileptic aura, or mixed type. Results A total of 54 pediatric and 65 adult video ictal EEG studies were evaluated. Minor motor type was the most common clinical semiology among adult and pediatric groups, yet more prevalent in pediatric than adult patients (61.1% vs. 40.0%, P = 0.022). In comparison, the major motor events were significantly higher in adults than in pediatrics (25 event [38.5%] vs. 9 events [16.7%], P = 0.009). No statistically significant differences were found between pediatrics and adults regarding pelvic thrusting (3.7% vs. 9.2%), back arching (7.4% vs. 4.6%), clenched fists (9.3% vs. 15.4%), ictal pain (13.0% vs. 18.5%), ictal fear (5.6% vs. 3.1%), or ictal crying (7.4% vs. 4.6%), respectively. Conclusions The semiology of functional seizures varies between pediatric and adult age groups; minor motor events predominate in pediatric patients, while the major motor type is more common in adults.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Antonie van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723) transformed observation into science through the power of a single handmade lens. His work emerged from the visual culture of seventeenth-century Delft, where craftsmanship, optics, and artistic precision intersected. While Robert Hooke’s compound microscope introduced the idea of microscopic visualization, Leeuwenhoek’s single-lens instruments achieved far superior magnification and resolution by minimizing optical interfaces. Using these deceptively simple devices, he documented the first observations of free-living microorganisms, fungal hyphae, red blood cells, capillary flow, oral bacteria, and spermatozoa in more than two hundred letters to the Royal Society of London. But his investigations reached far beyond microbiology. Leeuwenhoek also examined the barbed structure of the bee sting, the ordered vessels of ash wood, and the geometric microstructure of crystals and salts—demonstrating that hidden organization pervades both living and non-living matter. These studies established microscopy as a universal investigative tool, capable of unifying biology, medicine, botany, and early materials science under a single optical principle. Leeuwenhoek’s work marks one of the earliest examples of how rigorous observation can redefine scientific domains. His use of a home-crafted single lens created an empirical foundation for biological microscopy that persists to this day. The legacy of his minimalist optical design also survives in the digital age: modern clip-on smartphone microscopes and paper-based platforms such as the Foldscope reproduce the same single-lens principle through micro-optics mounted directly onto digital sensors. Three and a half centuries later, his work continues to remind us that new worlds do not emerge from new theories alone, but from new ways of seeing.",

The method is based on the burstiness property of long-tailed distributions and provides as a forecast the median value of activity at each range, of both ROTI amplitude and forecast horizon. Previous proposed ROTI forecasting methods may degrade when faced with missing data points and the irregular, heavy-tailed characteristics of ROTI. In contrast, our model, based on the power-law dynamics observed in the persistent and bursty nature of long-tail distributions, allows for gaps in the measurements and provides a global forecast for regions covered by the network of GNSS stations. The performance of the model has been validated against historical GNSS data across various ionospheric conditions, demonstrating its robustness. The proposed Bayesian probabilistic model demonstrates robust forecasting capabilities, validated across diverse ionospheric conditions using historical GNSS data. It achieves strong performance metrics, with Weighted Kappa values exceeding 40% for prediction horizons up to 120 min and maintaining Mean Precision above 65% across all tested horizons from 30 min to 6 h. By forecasting the probability of ROTI exceeding specific levels, this method helps to identify geographical regions where GNSS reliability may be compromised, thereby aiding in the mitigation of adverse space weather effects on critical navigation and communication systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background This case report is significant due to its illustration of how infectious endocarditis on a prosthetic mitral valve revealed an underlying metastatic colorectal cancer. Although uncommon, associations between cardiac infection and advanced malignancy, particularly with malignancy serving as the source of infection, have been documented in the literature, making this case clinically significant and complex. Case presentation A 54-year-old postmenopausal woman with insulin-dependent diabetes and poorly managed hypertension, who had previously undergone mitral valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis and tricuspid valve repair for rheumatic mitral stenosis, was admitted for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. On admission, she presented with normochromic normocytic anaemia (7.7 g/dL), elevated inflammatory markers (CRP 250 mg/L), and leukocytosis (14,000/µL, neutrophils 10,000/µL). Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography identified vegetation on the mitral prosthesis with elevated gradients. Blood cultures were positive for Escherichia coli. A thoraco-abdominopelvic CT scan revealed a rectal tumor, confirmed by FDG-PET, with features consistent with metastatic colorectal cancer, considered the entry point for the infectious endocarditis. Tumor markers including ACE, CA 19 − 9, and CA 72 − 4 were elevated. The patient was treated with dual antibiotic therapy and showed initial clinical improvement but later died due to ventricular tachycardia. Conclusions This case highlights the importance of considering atypical sources, such as metastatic cancer, in unresolved cases of endocarditis. It underscores the need for comprehensive diagnostic assessment, including oncologic evaluation, in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by atypical pathogens like E. coli. It also stresses the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration between cardiology and oncology teams. This case report is significant due to its illustration of how infectious endocarditis on a prosthetic mitral valve revealed an underlying metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC).",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Luminal breast cancer (LBC) is the most common subtype of breast cancer affecting women worldwide. Although luminal breast cancer typically has a better prognosis, it mostly responds poorly to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Non-coding RNAs, especially long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs are crucial in regulating biological processes that contribute to breast cancer development. MALAT1, a long non-coding RNA, is pivotal in the progression of breast cancer. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is critical for cell movement during embryonic development. Clarifying this role could pave various avenues for developing innovative strategies for combating this subtype of malignancy. The present study aimed to investigate the expression profiles and clinical relevance of MALAT1 level and EMT-related miRNAs (miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-93-5p, miR-135b-5p, and miR-146a-5p) alongside EMT markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, twist, SNAI1, Slug, ZEB1, and ZEB2) in LBC patients. Methods Fresh tissues were collected from fifty patients and twenty noncancerous controls. Differential expression of the markers was evaluated using qRT-PCR assay. Spearman Rho test assessed the relationship between the expression levels. Linear regression test evaluated the correlation between the parameters and various clinico-pathological features. Results Our results revealed an overall upregulation of MALAT1 in breast cancer tissues although this increase did not reach statistical significance. Overexpression of miR-20a-5p, miR-135b, and ZEB2 was reported, whereas miR146a-5p, ZEB1 and Vimentin levels were suppressed. Correlation analysis demonstrated that miR-20a-5p was positively correlated with SNAI1, E-cadherin, N-cadherin and Slug also it was significantly associated with family history and tumor laterality. Conclusions Our findings suggest that miR-20a-5p plays an oncogenic role in luminal breast cancer by promoting EMT, while MALAT1 may contribute to disease progression through indirect regulatory mechanisms. Finally, MALAT1 and miR-20a-5p might serve as potential therapeutic and prognostic targets in LBC.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is a frequent and debilitating complication of advanced malignancy, often resulting in significant morbidity and impaired quality of life. The optimal approach for durable pleural control and symptom relief remains debated. This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy and clinical outcomes of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pleurodesis versus conventional thoracostomy tube drainage with chemical pleurodesis in patients with MPE. A total of 100 patients with a confirmed MPE diagnosis were randomized equally into two groups ( n = 50 each): VATS pleurodesis and thoracostomy tube drainage with bleomycin pleurodesis. The primary endpoint was successful pleurodesis (complete response) after 30 days. Secondary outcomes included hospital stay, pain score, postoperative performance status, and complications. Results VATS achieved a significantly higher pleurodesis success rate (90% vs 72%; p = 0.022) and better postoperative performance status (ECOG I: 50% vs. 10%; p &lt; 0.001). Median hospital stay was shorter in the VATS group (4 vs. 7.5 days; p &lt; 0.001), and postoperative pain scores were lower ( p = 0.039).

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is the mildest form of hepatic encephalopathy, often undetected in clinical practice, and reflects central nervous system dysfunction caused by liver disease and/or portosystemic shunting. MHE is often assessed using various diagnostic methods, including psychometric tests and electroencephalograms. The Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score (PHES) is considered the definitive diagnostic tool for MHE; however, its practical limitations have led researchers to explore noninvasive biomarkers, whose diagnostic validity remains unproven. Objectives This study aims to assess the role of serum neurofilament light chain (NFLC) levels as an early diagnostic biomarker for MHE in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) before progression to overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE) compared to an abbreviated psychometric battery (APB) for neurocognitive assessment. Patients and methods This case-control study included 150 participants, divided into three equal groups: 50 cirrhotic patients with psychometric impairment consistent with MHE; 50 cirrhotic patients without psychometric impairment of MHE; and 50 healthy volunteers. All subjects provided a thorough history, underwent clinical examination, and had laboratory tests. Neurocognitive performance was assessed using an Abbreviated Psychometric Test Battery evaluating attention and psychomotor speed, and serum NFLC levels were measured with ELISA. Results Serum NFLC levels exhibited significant variation among the three groups, with the greatest levels in the MHE group (644.0 ± 153.1 pg/mL), intermediate values in cirrhotic patients without MHE (318.8 ± 49.7 pg/mL), and the lowest levels in healthy controls (61.1 ± 16.5 pg/mL). At a cutoff point of &gt; 420 pg/mL, serum NFLC predicted MHE with 98.0% sensitivity, 96.0% specificity, 96.1% positive predictive value (PPV), and 98.0% negative predictive value (NPV). The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.996 ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Elevated NFLC levels were linked to psychometric impairment consistent with MHE and had a significant inverse correlation with the APB score. This suggests that NFLC may be effective for early identification of MHE.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) is largely attributed to dysfunction of the cochlear stria vascularis (SV). This study aimed to define the molecular mechanisms underlying SV aging and identify therapeutic targets. Methods Lifespan transcriptomic profiling and systems-level analyses were performed on mouse cochleae to reveal age-associated pathways. Functional and pharmacological assays were used to examine the effects of IκB kinase (IKK) inhibition both in vitro and in aging mice. Results Aged SV displayed profound transcriptional reprogramming toward a pro-inflammatory and metabolically impaired state. A regulatory hub comprising AP-1, NF-κB, and CEBPB was identified as a master inflammatory switch. TNFα activation disrupted the blood-labyrinth barrier and mitochondrial function, while IKK inhibition reversed these effects and mitigated hearing loss in aging mice. Conclusions Targeting the IKK–NF-κB axis preserves cochlear integrity and offers a promising therapeutic strategy to prevent age-related hearing loss.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper investigates the built environment of traditional maritime adapted ‘sea nomads’ of the Andaman Sea. For centuries, groups of people with a maritime adapted subsistence strategy have lived in small groups distributed widely across the islands and coasts of the Andaman Sea and South China Sea, moving constantly between the variable coastal eco-niches, in a revolving kaleidoscope of reconfigured social patterns, to maximise access to fish, marine mammals and shellfish. To maintain the resilience and sustainability of this maritime subsistence strategy, the Chaw Lay have evolved an adaptive culture based on and characterised by mobility – physical mobility, artifact mobility and social mobility. Mobility is also characteristic of their built environment, which is based on a distinctive modular and recyclable construction technology. All of their structures are improvised with primary materials available in the immediate coastal environment occupied by the Chaw Lay, Using these materials, the Chaw Lay construct a variety of simple utilitarian structures all of which are based on the simple form of a ‘rack’ – ad-hoc, pre-fab, moveable and reusable – adapted to the coastal environment, tropical climate, and monsoon weather. This paper then examines the implications of this technological style for archaeological retrieval and interpretation. If – as this paper demonstrates to be the case with the Chaw Lay built environment – structures of a specific cultural groups are all constructed in accordance with a culturally pre-determined modular construction technology, an assessment can be made of the degree to which of a small archaeological sample can be understood to be an accurate and representative proxy for the whole of the society’s build environment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Nonlinear metasurfaces have been enabling unprecedented control over light generation and wave mixing, demonstrating enhanced wavefront control, beam shaping and steering of nonlinear light waves. However, the design and operation of nonlinear metasurfaces have been for the most part limited to localized modes, fundamentally limiting the overall nonlinearity enhancement of such devices. Periodic structures supporting extended lattice resonances can realize much larger quality-factor resonances, and hence stronger nonlinearity enhancement, but they are fundamentally limited in their wavefront shaping capabilities, due to their high symmetry. Nonlocal metasurfaces have been recently introduced in linear settings to support highly delocalized resonant modes that can promote very large quality factors, yet without requiring periodicity, hence providing also local control over the wavefront. Here, we extend the powerful features of nonlocal metasurfaces to nonlinear phenomena, experimentally demonstrating nonlinear nonlocal metasurfaces that simultaneously support high quality factor modes, and hence strong nonlinearity enhancement, as well as a spatially varying geometric phase tailored over a subwavelength scale. We show how nonlinear nonlocal metasurfaces can at the same time enhance light-matter interactions, boosting nonlinear conversion efficiency, and enable precise subwavelength control over the wavefront of the generated light. Using this platform, we demonstrate a silicon metasurface for beam steering of third-harmonic generation in the visible. Our results show control over the polarization and steering angle of the third-harmonic signal, extending the framework of diffractive nonlocal metasurfaces to nonlinear optics, and pave the way for the development of nanoscale nonlinear devices with unparalleled control over the optical properties of generated light.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Prunus mume originated from China and is highly valued for its remarkable combination of ornamental blossoms and high economic value. Previously published P . mume genomes contain unanchored genetic regions and excessive gaps. Here, we report the P . mume f. viridicalyx gap-free telomere-to-telomere (T2T) haplotype genome. The LE_hap1 and LE_hap2 genomes were 229.29 and 228.36 Mb in length, respectively, with an N50 length of the contig between 27.65 and 27.79 Mb and 24,318 and 24,316 protein-coding genes, respectively. The completeness, continuity, and accuracy of the P . mume f. viridicalyx genome was significantly improved over the previous P . mume genomes. The key mutated genes during P . mume f. viridicalyx cultivar domestication were identified by comparative genomic, population evolution, and selective sweep analyses to be significantly enriched in the anthocyanin metabolism process, glutathione metabolism process, and carotenoid biosynthesis. Further analysis revealed that early codon termination of the PmGSTF2 gene, which is the key gene for the characteristic production of P . mume f. viridicalyx, reduced anthocyanin accumulation. We assembled a complete T2T gap-free haplotype P . mume genome, which provides a reference for gene mining and genome evolution of the anthocyanin deficiency phenotype in P . mume .",

    "Abstract": "Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has a negative impact on quality of life (QoL) and sexual function, mainly owing to increased levels of anxiety and distress. Aims To examine the potentially moderating effects of general psychological health on the relationships between (a) HPV-related psychosocial burden and QoL and (b) HPV-related psychosocial burden and sexual function. Method The HPV Impact Profile, Female Sexual Function Index, General Health Questionnaire-28 and Life Satisfaction Inventory questionnaires were completed by 151 women. Results HPV-related psychosocial burden and general psychological health accounted for 23.2% of QoL variability. There was not strong evidence for a moderating effect of general psychological health on the relationship between HPV-related psychosocial burden and QoL. Higher HPV-related psychosocial burden predicted worse sexual function on average. However, HPV-related psychosocial burden accounted for only 4.1% of sexual function variability. Conclusions Higher HPV-related psychosocial burden is associated with lower QoL as well as worse sexual function. General psychological health predicts changes in QoL over and above HPV-related psychosocial burden; thus, a deep understanding of emerging mental health issues soon after diagnosis is crucial to improve counselling and enhance women’s mental empowerment to achieve a better psychological response.",

    "Abstract": "Background Depression screening in primary care has been widely discussed, but its economic implications have remained largely unexplored. The GET.FEEDBACK.GP randomised controlled trial evaluated feedback interventions after depression screening in primary care. The study arms were (a) feedback provided to the general practitioner; (b) feedback to both the patient and the treating general practitioner; and (c) a control group without feedback. Analysis of clinical effectiveness revealed that feedback interventions were not associated with decreased depression severity. Their economic implications were the subject of this study. Aims To evaluate the economic impact of general-practitioner- and patient-targeted feedback following depression screening for adults in German primary care. Method A cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective of feedback interventions after depression screening with a time horizon of 12 months was conducted. Direct and indirect costs were estimated. Quality-adjusted life years were calculated on the basis of the EQ-5D-5L, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves based on the net monetary benefit were constructed. Sensitivity analyses and post hoc explorative subpopulation analyses were performed. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03988985. Results In total, 987 participants who screened positive for at least moderate depression were included. Feedback provision was not significantly associated with changes in costs or quality-adjusted life years during follow-up. Cost-effectiveness probabilities of feedback interventions were lower than 50% compared with no feedback. Higher cost-effectiveness probabilities were observed in patients whose suspected depression was confirmed 1 month post-screening and in those with previous depression. Conclusions The analysed feedback interventions cannot be considered to be cost-effective for the investigated population. Patient-targeted feedback was potentially cost-effective for subpopulations, particularly patients with a later confirmed depression diagnosis; this requires further research.",

    "Abstract": "Background Studies have shown that klotho, a neuroprotective protein, plays a crucial role in neurodevelopment. However, its association with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, remains uncertain. Aims To elucidate klotho levels in adolescents with ADHD and to clarify its association with executive function. Method The present study enrolled 92 adolescents (mean approximate age 14 years) diagnosed with ADHD and 80 age-matched healthy adolescents. All participants had their klotho levels measured and underwent the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST); their parents fulfilled the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham IV (SNAP-IV) scale and the Child Behavior Checklist-Dysregulation Profile (CBCL-DP). Results Results from generalised linear models (GLMs), with adjustments for age, gender, body mass index, clinical symptoms (SNAP-IV and CBCL-DP scores) and ADHD medication use, indicated that adolescents with ADHD had significantly lower klotho levels ( P = 0.044) and performed worse on WCST ( P = 0.027) compared with healthy adolescents. The GLMs further indicated a negative association between klotho levels and the percentage of non-perseverative errors on WCST ( P = 0.002). Conclusions Klotho may serve as a novel biomarker of ADHD and play a key role in ADHD-related executive dysfunction.",

    "Abstract": "Background Bipolar disorder and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) share overlapping clinical symptoms and cognitive deficits. Up to 20% of individuals with bipolar disorder also meet the criteria for ADHD (bipolar disorder + ADHD), a subgroup that may experience greater cognitive and functional impairments than those with bipolar disorder or ADHD alone. Aims To (a) characterise cognitive profiles in bipolar disorder, ADHD and bipolar disorder + ADHD compared with healthy controls; (b) examine associations between cognitive and occupational functioning; and (c) investigate associations between cognitive function and polygenic scores (PGS) for bipolar disorder, ADHD and educational attainment. Method In this observational study, 477 euthymic individuals with bipolar disorder (including 78 with bipolar disorder + ADHD), 59 adult individuals with ADHD and 171 healthy controls completed standardised neuropsychological testing. Full-scale IQ and final school grades indexed current and premorbid cognitive ability, respectively. Occupational functioning was evaluated both cross-sectionally and through 5 years of registry-based follow-up. PGS were available for 295 bipolar disorder and 132 healthy control participants. Results All patient groups performed significantly below healthy controls across most cognitive domains. Bipolar disorder + ADHD exhibited poorer working memory than bipolar disorder ( d = −0.35, 95% CI [−0.66, −0.03]). Occupational function was lowest in bipolar disorder + ADHD (versus bipolar disorder, d = −0.44, 95% CI [−0.69, −0.19]). In bipolar disorder, poorer executive function (standardised regression coefficient ( stand β ) = 0.20, 95% CI [0.09, 0.31]) and older age predicted reduced occupational outcomes. PGS for educational attainment was associated positively with cognition in both bipolar disorder (working memory: stand β = 0.19, 95% CI [0.08, 0.30]) and healthy controls (executive function: stand β = 0.20, 95% CI [0.09, 0.32]), while PGS for bipolar disorder or ADHD were not significantly associated with cognitive performance. Conclusions Individuals with bipolar disorder + ADHD showed disproportionate working memory and functional impairment compared with bipolar disorder or ADHD alone. Executive function is a key predictor of occupational outcomes in bipolar disorder and is partly shaped by genetic propensity for educational attainment. These findings highlight the importance of considering ADHD comorbidity and cognitive profiles when evaluating functional prognosis and tailoring interventions.",

Interferon-gamma production in normal lymphocyte-macrophage cultures treated with 10 to 100 micrograms/ml of glycyrrhizin at 37 degrees C for 12 hr or longer, and then treated with 10 micrograms/ml of Con A, was enhanced four to eight times compared to control cell cultures. Lymphocyte-macrophage cultures treated with 10 to 100 micrograms/ml of glycyrrhizin alone did not produce interferon. No significant difference in the adsorption of [3H]Con A to glycyrrhizin-treated and control lymphocyte-macrophage cultures was found, but RNA and protein synthesis of the treated lymphocytes was increased compared to control cells; DNA synthesis, however, was reduced. Collaboration between enriched T-lymphocytes and macrophages, both treated with glycyrrhizin, was needed for the enhancement of interferon-gamma production. A smaller increase in interferon production was also observed in the glycyrrhizin-treated peripheral lymphocyte-macrophage cultures derived from an asymptomatic carrier of hepatitis B virus, in response to Con A and surface antigen of hepatitis B virus.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND IMPORTANCE: Ruptured neoplastic cerebral aneurysms (NCAs) due to choriocarcinoma are rare. They are found most commonly in distal middle cerebral artery (MCA) and carry a high risk of rerupture, morbidity and mortality. We present a case of choriocarcinoma-associated NCA managed by a combination of microsurgical-trapping, flow diversion, and low-dose induction chemotherapy initiated in the early postoperative period. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: This 3-month postpartum young woman developed subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left sylvian fissure due to an irregular left MCA trifurcation fusosaccular aneurysm. Serum and cerebrospinal fluid beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG) levels were elevated. While undergoing a systemic workup, she reruptured and was taken for emergent craniectomy, with microsurgical trapping and excisional biopsy of the ruptured vessel segment. Rest of the unruptured diseased segment in inferior MCA trunk was flow diverted 5 days later using a Pipeline Vantage device (Medtronic) designed for smaller and more distal vessels. In an attempt to halt disease progression and prevent rerupture, 2 low-dose induction chemotherapy cycles (etoposide and cisplatin) were administered immediately over the following 2 weeks. She was later transitioned to etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin-D + cyclophosphamide, vincristine chemotherapy. She gradually improved and serum β-hCG levels normalized over 4 weeks after surgery. At 6-month follow-up, she had slight disability (modified Rankin Scale 2), and angiogram revealed resolution of inferior MCA aneurysmal dilatation. CONCLUSION: This case highlights a strategic synergistic application of microsurgical and endovascular modalities with chemotherapy while balancing the risks of aneurysm rerupture, stent thrombosis, and intracranial hemorrhage. It is also the first reported case of a ruptured NCA treated with flow diversion.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a popular intervention for small vestibular schwannomas in patients with preserved hearing. Gamma Knife radiosurgery (GKRS) and CyberKnife radiosurgery (CKRS) represent 2 alternative modalities, with CKRS potentially allowing for the delivery of higher doses over multiple sessions. However, the optimal dosing and hearing outcomes of CKRS remain unclear. This study systematically reviewed all literature describing outcomes following treatment of vestibular schwannomas with CKRS, with a focus on tumor control, hearing preservation, and dosing schema. METHODS: The PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases were queried to identify primary retrospective studies reporting local tumor control and hearing preservation rates following CKRS for vestibular schwannoma. Studies were reviewed, and the systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to PRISMA and meta-analysis guidelines. RESULTS: Fifteen studies with study periods ranging from 1998 to 2018 were included. These studies comprised 2018 patients (mean age, 60.2 years; range, 11-91 years; 52% female), of whom 64 had neurofibromatosis type 2. The mean follow-up was 40 (range, 6-120) months, and 309 patients had undergone prior treatment (surgery and/or stereotactic radiosurgery). In aggregate, local control at the last follow-up was 96% (95% CI, 95%-98%), and 73% (95% CI, 66%-81%) of patients had preserved hearing. The most common major complications after CKRS were facial neuropathy (1.4%), trigeminal neuralgia (1.3%), and hydrocephalus (0.5%). CKRS provides a high rate of short-term and mid-term tumor control with hearing preservation comparable with GKRS, but long-term outcomes remain under investigated. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis found that CKRS offers high rates of tumor control and hearing preservation in patients undergoing stereotactic radiosurgery for vestibular schwannomas. Current data suggest that CKRS is a reasonable, safe therapeutic option for patients with small tumors and preserved hearing. Further exploration in larger cohorts and direct comparison with GKRS is merited.",

    "Abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by acid α-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency, leading to lysosomal glycogen accumulation. Pathogenic GAA variants result in enzyme dysfunction and glycogen storage in cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle, as well as in the central nervous system, driving both systemic and neurological manifestations. We previously characterized a transgenic knock-in (KI) mouse carrying the Gaa c.1826dupA variant to 12 weeks of age, showing it recapitulates key biochemical and phenotypic features of PD. Here, we extend this analysis to present a long-term characterization of the Gaa c.1826dupA KI model using physiological, behavioral, biochemical, and histopathological assessments. KI mice exhibited early-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with significant cardiac functional decline, reduced body mass, impaired skeletal muscle strength, locomotion, coordination, and balance. Biochemically, KI mice showed decreased GAA activity and increased lysosomal glycogen accumulation in the heart, diaphragm, gastrocnemius, and brain. Despite these abnormalities, survival did not differ from wild-type mice—a divergence from severe human PD but consistent with other murine models. Collectively, these findings support this KI model as a translational platform for therapeutic evaluation in PD.",

    "Abstract": "Moderate-altitude residence (1,600-2,400 m) elicits altitude acclimatization and reduces acute mountain sickness (AMS) following rapid ascent to higher altitude (HA). Cross-sectional studies suggest lower altitude residence (800-1,200 m) provides similar benefits, but conclusions are unclear due to lack of control. Purpose: Determine whether moderate-altitude residents (MAR, 1,200 m) experience less AMS than low-altitude residents (LAR) following active or passive ascent to HA (3,600 m). Methods: 78 Soldiers (mean±SD; age=26±5yr; women=8) were tested at their baseline residence at 331 m (LAR; n=41) or 1,200 m (MAR; n=37), transported to Taos, NM (2,845 m), hiked (n=39) or were driven (n=39) to 3,600 m and stayed for 4 days. AMS was assessed using the Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire twice on day 1 (HA1), five times on days 2 and 3 (HA2, HA3) and once on day 4 (HA4). Daily peak cerebral factor score (AMS-C) was recorded; if AMS-C was ≥ 0.7 individuals were considered sick that day. Results: Ascent condition (active vs. passive) did not demonstrate a significant main or interaction effect on AMS. The MAR vs. LAR experienced lower AMS incidence on HA1 (16% vs. 44%, p=0.008) and HA2 (19% vs. 39%, p=0.05), similar incidence on HA3 (14% vs. 29%, p=0.08) and lower incidence on HA4 (0% vs. 17%, p=0.007). AMS-C was lower in MAR vs. LAR on HA1 (0.40±0.49 vs. 0.74±0.86, p=0.04), HA2 (0.30±0.34 vs. 0.86±0.88, p=0.001), HA3 (0.30±0.36 vs. 0.56±0.69, p=0.03) and HA4 (0.09±0.14 vs. 0.35±0.58, p=0.01). MAR exhibited an approximately 3-fold reduction in the odds of developing AMS at HA1 (odds ratio (OR)=0.25, p=0.01), HA2 (OR=0.37, p=0.05) and HA3 (OR=0.38, p=0.09) compared to LAR. Conclusions: Residence at 1,200 m induces a 3-fold reduction in the odds of developing AMS following rapid ascent to 3,600 m.",

    "Abstract": "Loyalty programs are widespread across various markets, offering members rewards based on their past purchases for future benefits. This study offers new insights into the strategic use of loyalty programs and their impact on market competition by exploring the dynamics of loyalty programs within a repeated ordered search framework, in which consumers sequentially search for the optimal product across multiple firms over two periods. Our findings highlight distinct roles for price discounts and rewards in influencing consumer decisions. Price discounts discourage further search in the current shopping period, whereas rewards encourage consumer loyalty by inducing prominence in subsequent visits. As search costs increase, firms tend to offer lower price discounts but higher rewards, and this results in a higher industry profit but lower consumer surplus. Compared with their absence, loyalty programs decrease both industry profit and consumer welfare, leading to a lose–lose outcome. Moreover, we demonstrate that, when the firms are heterogeneous in terms of their network sizes, those with larger networks tend to offer lower rewards yet achieve greater consumer loyalty in contrast to the firms with smaller networks, which compensate with higher rewards.

    "Abstract": "Problem definition: A shift toward shopping at (autonomous) wheeled vending stores is redefining urban retail. Compared with traditional brick-and-mortar stores, such mobile stores are cost efficient to deploy and adaptive to fast-evolving business environments. However, mobile stores are confronted with unknown demand and limited capacity. Store mobility enables demand learning and profit maximization, yet an optimal dynamic store location policy remains unclear. Methodology/results: We model this “learning-and-earning” problem by taking optimistic actions under parameter uncertainty. The joint optimization over parameter and action set is complicated by the combinatorial nature and infinite choices within the action set. We overcome these challenges by leveraging continuous-approximation methods, and then, we propose a continuous-approximation optimistic (CA-O) learning framework under some special problem structures. Nevertheless, for more general scenarios, the problem remains intricate because of the nonconvexity in unknown parameters. We alternatively propose a CA-O faster learning algorithm by utilizing first-order approximation techniques and further proving a closed-form gradient to guarantee computational efficiency. We theoretically analyze and numerically validate the regret for the proposed algorithms. Managerial implications: In a Toronto case study, our algorithm significantly outperforms baselines. Mobile stores earn higher profits than brick-and-mortar stores through demand learning and store mobility. More broadly, this paper envisions the future landscape of urban retail enhanced by omnipresent mobile facilities. Funding: W.

    "Abstract": "Problem definition: Supply chain financing solutions allow financially weaker suppliers to secure funding based on the stronger financial standing of their buyers, presenting an alternative to conventional financing. This paper explores the preferences between immediate-tier financing (involving a direct buyer of the supplier) and remote-tier financing (involving a buyer’s buyer). Methodology/results: Using a model of a three-tier supply chain and a financial market, we solve for the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium for a game comprising supply chain financing supergame and financing subgames between a firm and investors, subject to equilibrium pricing of firms’ assets-in-place and moral hazard frictions. The game is dynamic and stochastic because production shocks and financing subgames occur over time, coinciding with trade transactions between firms, and because of the stochastic evolution of information about firms’ assets-in-place affecting demand for products of each firm. We identify three economic mechanisms that stem from the relative position of firms in the supply chain and that work against remote-tier financing: risk spillover, noise accumulation, and loss of hedging options. Risk spillover occurs when a firm’s pledge of assets to secure supplier financing increases its own financing risk, affecting upstream firms and transactions. Noise accumulation refers to the greater uncertainty in forecasts of asset values, which are realized later for remote-tier buyers. The loss of the hedging option occurs because, by helping the supplier initially, the remote-tier buyer loses some of the capacity to help the immediate-tier buyer later. These mechanisms may explain challenges faced by remote-tier supply chain financing in practice. Managerial implications: The paper highlights the challenges faced by remote-tier financing and identifies conditions under which it can be favorable. It extends traditional finance models to incorporate supply chain considerations, demonstrating the importance of these factors in economic and financial decision making.

    "Abstract": "Aims Total hip arthroplasty (THA) in the setting of proximal femoral defects and poor bone stock often necessitates distal fixation using specialized implants, such as monolithic tapered, fluted titanium stems (TFTSs), to ensure adequate stability. This study evaluates the mid-term outcomes of TFTS in both primary and revision THA. Methods This was a multi-institutional retrospective review of patients who received monolithic TFTS between July 2016 and June 2020 during either complex primary THA or revision THA. Outcomes included pre-, intra- and postoperative characteristics, as well as five-year all-cause, septic and aseptic revisions, and Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score for Joint Replacement (HOOS, JR) at different postoperative timepoints. Results A total of 115 patients with a mean follow-up of 6.3 years (SD 1.2) were included. Femoral component survivorship free from aseptic revisions was 99.1% (95% CI 97.3 to 100) at 5.1 years after TFTS. Aseptic revision occurred in a single patient (0.9%) due to periprosthetic acetabular fracture that necessitated femoral component removal for exposure 60.6 months following TFTS. Survivorship from septic revisions was 93.2% (95% CI 91.5 to 99.9) at 5.3 years. Septic revisions included debridement, irrigation and exchange of modular components (n = 3, 2.6%), and two-stage revision arthroplasties (n = 4, 3.5%) at a mean of 27.7 months after surgery (1.5 to 63.9). All-cause survivorship from any revision was 92.4% (95% CI 90.5 to 100) at 5.3 years after TFTS. HOOS, JR scores improved from preoperative to five-year follow-up (46.1 (SD 20.8) to 83.8 (SD 19.0), respectively). Conclusion The TFTS demonstrates excellent mid-term survivorship (99.1% at five years) and significant clinical improvement in complex primary and revision THA. These outcomes suggest that the TFTS can be considered a valuable option in this challenging patient population. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2026;7(2):138–147.",

    "Abstract": "Background Women remain underrepresented in surgery, with dropouts occurring at every stage of training, and women representing under 20% of consultant surgeons. This study explored the relationship between sex, applications for national selection for Higher Specialty Training (ST3), and receipt of an offer. Methods This retrospective longitudinal cohort study used data from the UK Medical Education Database. The study population included 1,960 doctors eligible to progress to higher training between 2014 and 2019. The primary outcomes of interest were application for and offer of an ST3 post. Logistic regression analysis was conducted after adjusting for confounders using a directed acyclic graph. Results Within the cohort, paediatrics and ear, nose and throat (ENT) had the highest proportion of female applicants (50%), followed by plastic and reconstructive surgery, general surgery (including vascular surgery applicants), urology, and trauma and orthopaedics, with the lowest (22%). Significant (p&lt;0.01) associations were identified between being female and applying for ST3 general, paediatric, and plastic surgery, while applications to orthopaedics favoured men. No association was found between sex and ENT or urology applications. For ST3 offers, significant sex associations favouring women were identified for general surgery and urology. No associations were observed for the other specialties or the cohort as a whole. Conclusions Differences exist in the proportion of women applying for ST3 across surgical specialties, with women more likely to obtain a post in general and urological surgery. Recognising these disparities and promoting efforts to cultivate a more diverse and inclusive workforce remains critical.",

    "Abstract": "Understanding 3D representations of spatial information, particularly in naturalistic scenes, remains a significant challenge in vision science. This is largely because of conceptual difficulties in disentangling higher-level 3D information from co-occurring features and cues (e.g., the 3D shape of a scene image is necessarily defined by “low-level” spatial frequency and orientation information). Recent work has employed newer models and analysis techniques that attempt to mitigate these difficulties within a model-comparison framework. For example, one such study reported 3D-surface features were uniquely present in areas OPA, PPA, and MPA/RSC (areas typically referred to as ‘scene-selective’), above and beyond a Gabor-wavelet baseline model. Here, we tested whether these findings generalized to a new stimulus set that, on average, dissociated static Gabor-wavelet baseline features from 3D scene-surface features. Surprisingly, we found evidence that a Gabor-wavelet baseline model—commonly thought of as a “low-level” or “2D” model—better fit voxel responses in areas OPA, PPA and MPA/RSC compared to a model with 3D-surface information. We highlight that this difference in results could be due to differences in the baseline conditions used across studies. These findings emphasize that much of the information in “scene-selective” regions—potentially even information about 3D surfaces—may be in the form of spatial frequency and orientation information often considered 2D or low-level. Disentangling lower-level and higher-level visual information is a continuing fundamental challenge for model-comparison approaches in visual cognition, and it motivates future work investigating which visual features could cue higher-level properties in our real-world visual experience—both within and beyond current model comparison frameworks.",

    "Abstract": "Dracunculus medinensis (Guinea worm; GW) is a parasitic nematode that causes dracunculiasis (Guinea worm disease; GWD). The annual incidence of GWD in humans has been reduced by over 99.9% globally since the 1980s thanks to the implementation of complementary interventions. Dogs are now the primary hosts of GW and impede eradication efforts. The antihelmenthic drug, flubendazole (FLBZ), was suggested as a possible therapeutic intervention after it was found to be partially effective at reducing fertility of D. medinensis in experimentally infected ferrets. A 2019 clinical trial of FLBZ in Chad found no statistically significant difference in GW infections between treated and control dogs, but longer term effects may be observed if FLBZ reduced fertility of D. medinensis. This study leveraged surveillance data from the National Guinea Worm Eradication Program of the monthly count of D. medinensis worms in dogs between January 1, 2019, and September 30, 2021, for 56 villages to examine whether FLBZ would have an observable effect over 33 months and in the presence of another intervention, proactive tethering. We fit hypothesis-informed models of the combined interventions using negative binomial generalized linear mixed models. We averaged the top models together and predicted the number of D. medinensis infections per month for an average village. Based on the model predictions, we observed a clear delineation of effects between March and August 2021, approximately one year after most villages initiated proactive tethering and approximately two years after a few villages initiated FLBZ treatment. During this period, the predicted number of dog infections were reduced by 83% (95% CI, 76% to 88%) when using FLBZ and proactive tethering concurrently, by 63% when using FLBZ alone (95% CI: 44% to 75%), and by 55% when using proactive tethering alone (95% CI: 52% to 58%) compared to baseline control methods. When used together, proactive tethering and FLBZ may be important tools in reducing the village-level D. medinensis burden in dogs.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Results from a few studies have been conflicting regarding whether iron deficiency affects HbA1c reliability, and the mechanisms by which iron might influence HbA1c are not fully understood. We aimed to compare the relationship between HbA1c and average glucose levels measured by continuous glucose monitoring, retrospectively, in iron-replete and iron-deplete states among non-anemic type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. Methods We compared the differences in HbA1c between iron-replete and iron-deplete groups using the Chi-square test for categorical data and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous data. We also evaluated the correlation between HbA1c and mean plasma glucose for both iron-replete and iron-deplete individuals using Pearson’s correlation and linear regression. Results A total of 146 of the 213 participants screened had complete data and were included in the final analysis. 43 out of 146 (29.5%) had iron deficiency, and 103 were iron-replete. No significant difference was observed in HbA1c levels between iron-replete and iron-deplete individuals: 69 (51.0, 85.0) vs 62 (46.0, 83.0) mmol/mol, P = 0.291). There was a strong positive correlation between HbA1c and mean plasma glucose concentration for both iron-replete and iron-deplete individuals (Pearson Correlation coefficient: 0.88 (0.83–0.92) and 0.93 (0.88–0.98), respectively). Conclusions HbA1c correlates well with mean blood glucose even in the iron-deplete state amongst non-anaemic T2DM individuals. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, particularly at screening and diagnostic thresholds.",

    "Abstract": "The digital transformation of work environments, particularly in academia, has introduced new psychosocial risks, including technostress. This cross-sectional study analyses the relationship between technostress and general health among university employees at the University of Zaragoza, examining the moderating effects of job type, contract status, and seniority. A total of 458 staff members, including academic and research staff and administrative and service staff, completed an online survey assessing general health, technostress, perceived stress, burnout, job satisfaction, resilience, social support, and other occupational variables. The results revealed that perceived stress was the most consistent predictor of emotional symptomatology across all subgroups. Technostress also emerged as a significant predictor, especially among permanent employees and those with longer tenure. Conversely, resilience and job satisfaction functioned as protective factors. Differences in health outcomes were observed depending on employment conditions, highlighting the importance of organizational context. These findings underscore the need for tailored interventions to mitigate psychosocial risks associated with information and communication technologies use and to enhance well-being in academic institutions. This study contributes to the growing evidence base on the health implications of digital work environments in the higher education sector.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the CFC tax rules are legally ineffective in relation to those of foreign countries that operate a tax refund system at the shareholder level of the CFC (e.g., Malta). Under such a tax refund system, the CFC itself is highly taxed, but its shareholder receives a tax refund from the CFC’s country of residence upon profit distribution. Therefore, the research question is that the current CFC rules, owing to their legal structure, cannot effectively cover foreign countries of residence of the CFC that apply a tax refund system at the shareholder level. Using theoretical and legal research, this study shows that CFC taxation is largely ineffective in relation to foreign tax refund systems unless all of a CFC’s shareholders’ tax refunds are included in the calculation of the CFC’s tax burden. To illustrate this phenomenon, a comparative analysis of the CFC legislation in Germany, Austria and South Africa is conducted. The issue of foreign tax refund systems represents a significant challenge, as they have the potential to undermine the efficiency of CFC taxation as a pivotal instrument in the fight against tax avoidance. To solve this problem, a legal framework for the taxation of CFCs in countries with a tax refund system is being developed within this study to strengthen the taxation of CFCs and fight international tax avoidance. This study is a pioneering investigation of the legal efficiency of CFC taxation in the context of foreign jurisdictions that operate a tax refund system at the shareholder level of the CFC. It identifies the fundamental shortcomings of CFC tax law in the context of foreign tax refund systems and proposes legal solutions.",

    "Abstract": "Epigenetic suppression and durable silencing of HIV represent a promising strategy to achieve ART-free remission, consistent with the “block and lock” HIV cure paradigm. BRD4 is a host epigenetic reader and plays a critical role in HIV transcriptional regulation. We previously identified ZL0580, a first-in-class BRD4-selective small molecule distinct from the pan-BET inhibitor JQ1, which induces HIV epigenetic suppression. However, detailed molecular mechanisms, pharmacokinetics (PK), and in vivo HIV-suppressive efficacy of ZL0580 remain undefined. Here, we show that ZL0580 selectively targets BRD4 bromodomain 1 (BD1) through interaction with a key glutamic acid residue (E151), as determined by structural modeling and mutagenesis. Transcriptomic profiling by RNA-seq reveals that ZL0580 and JQ1 induce opposing gene expression programs, consistent with their distinct effects on HIV proviral transcription and latency. In a humanized mouse model of HIV infection, ZL0580 monotherapy, or in combination with ART, potently suppressed active HIV replication, reducing the plasma viremia to nearly undetectable levels, and delayed viral rebound following treatment interruption. Collectively, these findings establish ZL0580 as an epigenetic suppressor of HIV in vivo and provide proof-of-concept for its potential as a “block and lock” HIV cure candidate, warranting further optimization and development.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract A novel etched substrate-integrated half-coaxial line (ESIHCL) is proposed and utilized to compose a shielded low-pass filter with high performance. In comparison with substrate integrated coaxial lines (SICLs), the characteristic impedance of the proposed structure is significantly enhanced and can be modified flexibly, making it highly suitable for implementing the inductive components of low-pass filters. Finally, a fifth-order Chebyshev low-pass filter with a ripple factor of 0.1 dB and a cut-off frequency of 0.85 GHz was designed by combining the high-impedance features of the new proposed ESIHCL and the low-impedance characteristics of the conventional SICL. The experimental results indicate that the designed low-pass filter achieves a minimum insertion loss of −0.2 dB and exhibits a wide 20 dB stopband from 1.197 to 18 GHz, which is employed in a compact size of only 0.0097 λg 2 . Moreover, its roll-off rate (ROR) reaches 53.628 GHz, demonstrating higher advantages in terms of filtering passband loss, stopband suppression, and size optimization. These characteristics make the filter highly suitable for modern RF systems, and are of great significance in reducing the size of RF systems in microwave regime.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The performance of free-space optical (FSO) communication systems is significantly affected by weather conditions and alignment losses between the transmitter and receiver, which can degrade signal quality. These challenges can be mitigated by optimizing key system parameters, particularly the divergence angle, which controls the optical beam’s spread during transmission. In this paper, we present a multi-verse optimizer (MVO) model to identify the optimal divergence angle, enhancing FSO system reliability under adverse conditions. Our approach evaluates the impact of divergence angles on system metrics such as link margin, deviation angle, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We compare the performance of MVO with particle swarm optimization (PSO), demonstrating that MVO achieves an average improvement of 20 %–30 % in link margin across different conditions. Simulation results validate the efficiency of MVO in optimizing FSO systems, identifying configurations that minimize link margin degradation and maximize system robustness. These findings offer actionable insights for designing resilient and efficient FSO communication links, ensuring dependable performance in diverse environmental scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This article presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the performance of a coupler system consisting of a laser diode (LD) and a single-mode elliptical core step index fiber (SMECSIF), together with a cylindrical microlens (CML) fabricated on the fiber tip. The study employs Gaussian field distributions for both the laser source and the fiber mode to develop a simplified yet accurate model for predicting the coupling efficiency (CE) between the LD and the SMECSIF through the CML. The analysis utilizes the ABCD matrix formalism under the paraxial approximation in order to describe the optical behaviour of the CML and explicitly accounts for the effect of its finite aperture. Analytical expressions for the CE are derived, allowing simple evaluation without the need for complex numerical simulations. The model developed helps to study the different parameters of fibers and source wavelengths in order to maximise the coupling performance. This analysis is therefore beneficial for providing theoretical guidance on designing efficient and high performance LD to fiber coupling systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The paper emphasises on the principles of O-ISAC such as coherent Lightwave modulation, spectrum recycling, and photonic signal processing which enable duality of operations to be realised seamlessly. By integrating sensing into the optical transmission, O-ISAC inherits the advantages of light such as high frequency, broad bandwidth, and low propagation delay, which is superior to the traditional RF-based ISAC. It has been shown by comparative study that OD integration shows better bandwidth scalability, lower energy consumption, and higher sensing resolution, which is a promising technology for the AI-based 6G ecosystem. To improve adaptation, the paper proposes an AI-based O-ISAC architecture. Machine learning and AI methods allow for adaptive resource allocation, joint perception-connectivity optimization, and intelligent orchestration among heterogeneous devices and apps. Simulation studies and experimental results also show the potential gains, including ∼65 % lower energy-per-bit consumption and over 2 × in enhancement of sensing accuracy with respect to the traditional dual-function systems. Last but not least, the abstract admits the deployment challenges, such as thermal management, fabrication yield, and standardization, which should tackle before the wide adoption. It ends with framing O-ISAC as a core nabling technology for scalable, sustainable, secure 6G networks, providing a road to a future-proof intelligent infrastructure.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives Viral infections are recognized contributors to the development or induction of autoimmune diseases, and COVID-19 has been associated with transient autoantibody formation and increased risk of new-onset autoimmune conditions. While individual-level risk is established, it is unclear whether these effects translate into measurable changes in positivity rates for autoimmune serology tests within the clinical laboratory. Methods We retrospectively compared the proportion of positive autoimmune serology tests performed in a large academic clinical laboratory during 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2022 (post-pandemic). Assays included: antinuclear antibody (ANA) indirect immunofluorescence, extractable nuclear antigens (ENA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), and organ-specific autoantibodies. Results ANA reactivity was stable between 2019 (39.0 %) and 2022 (39.2 %, p=0.84). ANA titers had a greater proportion of high-titer results in 2022 (≥1:2,560: 0.1 vs. 6.6 %, p&lt;0.0001). Homogeneous patterns increased (42.8% vs. 47.6 %, p=0.0047), while cytoplasmic patterns decreased (21.5% vs. 13.3 %, p&lt;0.0001). ANCA positivity declined (15.6% vs. 9.5 %, p&lt;0.0001). For organ-specific markers, anti-TPO positivity decreased (46.9% vs. 39.8 %, p&lt;0.0001), although titers were higher in 2022 (p&lt;0.0001). Other markers showed mixed or nonsignificant trends. Conclusions Although COVID-19 increases individual risk for autoimmune disease, we found no rise in overall autoantibody positivity at the clinical laboratory level. Positivity rates were stable or decreased, with some titers higher among positive cases. These findings suggest individual risk does not translate into detectable shifts at the laboratory level, underscoring the need for broader, longitudinal studies to define the long-term impact of COVID-19 and other viral outbreaks on the burden of autoimmune diseases.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Montmorillonite (MMT) is a layered silicate with high cation exchange capacity (CEC), but its intrinsic hydrophilicity restricts compatibility with hydrophobic polymer matrices. In this study, sodium MMT was modified using a homologous series of quaternary ammonium surfactants with varying alkyl chain lengths (C12–C18) at different CEC loadings (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0). The structural, thermal, and interfacial properties of the organo-montmorillonites (OMMTs) were systematically examined using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), CHNS elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and water contact angle (WCA) measurements. FTIR and CHNS confirmed increasing organic incorporation with chain length and loading, while XRD revealed expansion of basal spacing up to full CEC, followed by slight contraction at higher loadings due to surfactant reorganization. TGA identified two distinct decomposition regimes corresponding to strongly bound electrostatically intercalated surfactants and excess molecules stabilized via weaker surfactant–surfactant interactions. WCA measurements revealed maximum hydrophobicity at 1.0 CEC, with longer chains (C16–C18) favoring gallery expansion but mid-chain (C14) giving optimal hydrophobicity. Using the results, we establish a conformation scheme for surfactant packing within MMT galleries, linking ion exchange, chain length and loading to hydrophobic performance. This framework offers insight for tailoring OMMTs to achieve optimal polymer–clay compatibility in nanocomposite applications.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Black families often address police interaction safety with a conversation known as “The Talk.” Previous academic literature centering the physician’s perspective has proposed pediatrician involvement in anticipatory guidance on this topic. This study explores the views of Black teenage male individuals and their caregivers on pediatricians discussing safe police interactions as part of routine guidance and seeks to identify key factors for facilitating these discussions. METHODS Semistructured interviews were conducted individually with Black male individuals aged 13 to 18 years and their caregivers. Participants were recruited from primary care well visits at an academic institution in west Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Interviews were conducted virtually, recorded, and transcribed for analysis. Themes were validated by randomly selected participants of the study. RESULTS A total of 47 participants, including 20 youth-caregiver dyads, completed interviews. Participants supported pediatrician involvement in anticipatory guidance for teenagers about navigating police encounters, emphasizing that conversations should seek to improve youth safety and reduce fear during police encounters. Interviewees felt that racial concordance with pediatricians was not essential if the discussion was compassionate and culturally sensitive. Caregivers expressed a desire to align pediatrician guidance with family teaching and child’s social and cognitive development. Participants preferred one-on-one conversations with pediatricians to enhance receptivity. CONCLUSIONS Black teenage male individuals and their caregivers are open to pediatricians discussing police interactions as part of anticipatory guidance, emphasizing a tailored, sensitive approach. Further research is needed to investigate the perspectives of Black non-male youth and other populations disproportionately impacted by police violence.",

These melts have Mg-high (Mg# ≈ 76), Al-low and Ca-low basic compositions enriched in volatiles. Water content in melts could have reached up to 5.5 wt.%. These melts formed from a peridotite source, sometimes with slight admixture of pyroxenite component.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Miami-Dade County, FL, has complex hydrological and water management conditions, creating challenges for predicting groundwater levels. Due to the potential impacts of increasing sea level and changes in rain patterns on flooding and saltwater intrusion, it is essential to be able to accurately predict groundwater levels and to understand the drivers of groundwater levels. The method traditionally used to predict groundwater levels in south Florida and elsewhere is through the implementation of a numerical model. This research looks at machine learning techniques as an alternative method to provide improved predictions of groundwater levels. Extreme gradient boosting is one of the machine learning techniques that uses algorithms to train a model by identifying hidden patterns and relationships between groundwater level drivers and groundwater levels. The accuracies of the extreme gradient boosting model and a numerical model were compared by computing the root mean square error as a model performance measure. Comparing these two methods showed that the extreme gradient boosting model had better accuracy in predicting groundwater levels at the majority of groundwater monitoring sites. Furthermore, comparison of these two models helped us to identify problematic areas where both models performed poorly and narrow down the factors that could cause this poor model performance. Finally, the extreme gradient boosting method gave the importance of each feature included among the potential groundwater level drivers, including the ranked importance of a particular factor and its lag time, at each of the considered groundwater level monitoring sites.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Medical school admission pathways are designed to select suitable applicants, with different approaches potentially impacting students’ learning behaviors and performance. Objective This study aimed to compare students’ self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies, assessment engagement statistics (AES), nongrading evaluation (Outstanding [“O”]/Satisfactory [“S”]/Unsatisfactory [“U”]) preferences, and academic performance across admission pathways, and analyze correlations and linear regression models among summative scores, AES, and course learning outcome (CLO) scores. Methods This mixed methods retrospective observational and cross-sectional survey study used census sampling with selection criteria of all enrolled first-year medical students in 2021 (N=319) across 4 admission pathways: academic (n=23), quota (n=6), test (n=261), and rural (n=29). Demographics included age (19‐24 years) and sex (167/319, 52.4% male). AES, CLO scores, and summative scores were obtained from institutional databases. Two system-embedded institutional questionnaires assessed SRL strategies (316/319, 99.1% response rate) and “O”/“S”/“U” preferences (299/319, 93.7% response rate). Outcome measures included SRL strategies, AES, “O”/“S”/“U” preferences, CLO scores, and summative scores. Statistical significance was set at P &lt;.05. Results When compared among pathways, using one-way ANOVA with Fisher least significant difference post hoc tests, the academic group reported significantly higher mean (with 95% CI) goal setting (4.35, 4.07‐4.63), enthusiasm (4.43, 4.18‐4.69), and lower stress during study (2.64, 2.15‐3.12), while the rural group showed higher pre-examination stress (4.38, 4.10‐4.66) (all P &lt;.05). Most academic (14/22, 63.6%), quota (5/6, 83.3%), and test students (132/243, 54.3%) preferred “O”/ “S”/“U,” while the rural students preferred “S”/“U” (13/28, 46.4%). The academic group showed significantly higher CLO and summative scores but fewer total and intentional attempts and instances of first-pass and highest scoring attempts (all P &lt;.05), whereas the rural group showed significantly lower CLO and summative scores and higher instances of first-pass and highest scoring attempts (all P &lt;.05). For correlation analyses, using Pearson correlation coefficient, summative scores were positively correlated with CLO scores and number of passings and negatively with first-pass attempts. For multiple linear regression analyses, summative scores were positively influenced by number of passings for each CLO and CLO scores and negatively influenced by instances of first-pass attempts and highest scoring attempts. Overall, the academic group demonstrated higher academic performance and fewer attempts and instances of first-pass and highest scoring attempts, while the rural group showed lower academic performance, requiring more attempts for first-passing CLOs. Conclusions Admission pathways significantly influence students’ SRL strategies, AES, evaluation preferences, and academic performance. This study is innovative in analyzing these interconnected components within a single cohort, unlike prior research that examined them separately. By integrating assessment-engagement analytics with SRL data, it offers equity-oriented evidence on how admission systems shape learning behaviors and academic trajectories. These findings provide actionable insights for inclusive curriculum design and early identification of at-risk students. Real-world implications include targeted mentoring, SRL-focused interventions, and assessment reforms balancing academic rigor with psychological safety.",

    "Abstract": "We report on our study the impact of relativistic corrections to prompt $\\psi(2S)$ production at high transverse momenta $(P_T)$ at hadron colliders within nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD). Our computation bears on Leading-Power (LP) factorisation in terms of Fragmentation Functions (FFs), valid at high $P_T$, including next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections to partonic cross sections, augmented by next-to-leading-logarithmic (NLL) resummation of collinear emissions through DGLAP evolution. We have performed a joint evolution of charm and gluon FFs with a complete analysis of short- and long-distance uncertainties. Relativistic corrections turn out to be very large for the gluon FF and moderate for the charm FF. Their inclusion brings our results into agreement with the ATLAS and CMS prompt data without the need to consider higher-order colour-octet contributions, particularly for $P_T\\gtrsim 60$ GeV, where next-to-LP contributions are small. We have also studied the polar anisotropy, which is strongly affected by relativistic corrections to the gluon channel. We find that predictions are encouragingly close to the CMS prompt data up to $P_T=100$ GeV. We also comment on the impact of relativistic corrections in the $P_T$ range of the Tevatron. In a region where next-to-LP contributions should be important, we find that our results are very close to the CDF data.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate characterization of subducting slab geometry is fundamental to understanding the distribution of earthquakes, the dynamics of arc volcanism, and the assessment of seismic hazards. Well-constrained slab structures also serve as critical inputs for geophysical imaging and geodynamic modeling efforts that aim to resolve key processes in subduction zones. In this study, we present a comprehensive, margin-wide model of the Moho associated with the subducting oceanic plate beneath the Cascadia subduction zone, developed through the integration of publicly available offshore and onshore datasets. We integrate high-resolution seismic reflection data from the offshore CASIE21 expedition with three previously published, lower-resolution onshore slab models (McCrory et al., 2012; Hayes et al., 2018; Bloch et al., 2023) to construct a unified Moho surface. This synthesis produces six alternative Moho geometries, enabling flexibility for studies that require varying structural assumptions. The accompanying open-source workflow offers a transparent and adaptable approach for combining heterogeneous datasets. In areas lacking direct constraints, Moho depths were estimated through interpolation from adjacent regions. The resulting models provide a valuable foundation for analyzing along-strike variations in slab structure and their implications for Cascadia geodynamics.",

    "Abstract": "Generative AI offers strong potential for developing customized second language learning materials and tools. However, generating texts for absolute beginners—requiring strict lexical and grammatical control—remains a challenge. Although controlled text generation (CTG) techniques exist, they often require technical expertise and infrastructure, limiting accessibility for educators. This study evaluates, in the context of Spanish, a prompt-based approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) without fine-tuning or specialized tools. Prompts enforce linguistic constraints defined in two attachments: a categorized Spanish vocabulary list, and a set of example sentences illustrating approved Spanish grammatical structures organized by communicative function. Three variables were manipulated: AI model (ChatGPT-4o vs. Claude 3.5 Sonnet), prompt type (standard vs. extended, with constraint-enhancing techniques), and attachment format (rich-heavyweight vs. lightweight JSON). A secondary variable, text type (city descriptions, personal introductions, and dialogues), was also examined. A total of 720 texts were generated, 30 per condition. Measures included proportions of non-compliant lexical and grammatical items, user-perceived latency, and errors in vocabulary, grammar, and coherence. Model choice was the primary driver of constraint adherence, with Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperforming ChatGPT-4o. Extended prompts improved adherence across models. Attachment format showed no systematic effect on adherence, but JSON significantly reduced latency and response-time variability. Text type also influenced adherence, and error rates remained low. Findings offer educators a scalable, low-barrier solution for generating tailored beginner-level Spanish materials and AI-powered tools using LLMs, along with insights into how different design choices affect performance. This approach, transferable to other languages, provides a practical alternative to resource-intensive CTG techniques, addressing a critical gap in AI-assisted language education.",

    "Abstract": "Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) of patients with differentiated metastatic thyroid cancer has been standard treatment for more than 80 y. A high and uniform expression of the NaI symporter in malignant thyroid cells results in tumoricidal absorbed doses (ADs) delivered by the β-particle emissions of the radioactive iodine (<sup>131</sup>I). Treatment is less effective for patients whose disease exhibits reduced or variable expression of NaI symporter. <b>Methods:</b> We have investigated a treatment strategy that combines radioiodine with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for patients with low <sup>131</sup>I uptake. By combining the AD delivered by the RPT agent with that delivered by EBRT, we achieve the targeted tumoricidal AD (80 Gy 2-Gy equieffective dose) while maintaining safe normal-organ AD. A tracer administration of RPT is used to calculate a patient-specific administered activity (AA) for therapy that yields organ-at-risk ADs below toxicity thresholds. The tumor and relevant organ-at-risk ADs from the therapeutic administration are calculated and provided to the radiation oncology medical physicists for combination therapy planning. We illustrate this precision-medicine approach to treating thyroid cancer patients using data from the first 5 patients in our ongoing clinical trial. <b>Results:</b> A precision-medicine approach gave an AA ranging from 14.3 to 19.5 GBq. Combined RPT-EBRT therapy of the selected lesions yielded doses ranging from 73 to 147 Gy. <b>Conclusion:</b> We have demonstrated the feasibility of combined RPT-EBRT in thyroid cancer patients with reduced radioiodine uptake when a standard AA of 5.55 GBq (150 mCi) would have delivered a much lower AD to lesions, less likely to lead to a response. There is considerable patient variability in clearance kinetics. Clinical benefit assessment in adjusting AA on the basis of a precision methodology would require a multicenter trial.",

    "Abstract": "Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Advances in surgical techniques and immunosuppressive regimens have markedly improved early post-transplant survival. However, long-term outcomes remain compromised by HCC recurrence, chronic rejection, metabolic complications, and de novo malignancies. Recurrence of HCC after LT remains a major clinical challenge, with available prognostic models providing limited accuracy in risk stratification. Simultaneously, systemic therapies for unresectable HCC have rapidly advanced, particularly with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), providing new opportunities and unique challenges in transplant settings. With ICIs carrying a risk of acute and potentially fatal rejection and lacking controlled data on efficacy or safety in the post-transplant setting, tyrosine kinase inhibitors currently represent a standard option for post-transplant recurrence. Novel biomarkers, such as donor-derived cell-free DNA and the gut microbiome, are emerging as potential tools to refine risk stratification and guide immunosuppression. Furthermore, innovative immunotherapies, including oncolytic viruses and mRNA vaccines, are being explored as tumor-specific approaches. Collectively, these advances may reshape future management of LT recipients.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Abnormal glucose metabolism, which is a common condition in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), triggers a number of changes in various organs. Additionally, elevated blood glucose level also affects the bones. Bone mineral density (BMD), vitamin D, calcium, phosphates, and magnesium serum concentrations are significant factors assessed in bone metabolism. In this study, we evaluated these factors and the impact of vitamin D supplementation on vitamin D and BMD levels in T1DM patients. Materials and methods The study included 66 adults with T1DM and a control group of 66 healthy adults of the same age and weight. Densitometric measurements of the lumbar spine (L1–L4) and femoral neck (FN) were performed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The concentration of vitamin D, calcium, phosphates, and magnesium in the blood was assessed. All patients completed a questionnaire regarding vitamin D supplementation and symptoms associated with osteoporosis. Results Significant differences in the range, BMD, Z-score and T-score for FN and L1-L4 were observed in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Only 50% of participants with diabetes and osteopenia and only 40% of diabetic patients without osteopenia showed optimal vitamin D concentration. There were no differences in BMD, T-score and Z-score of FN, as well as in L1-L4 between the subjects who supplemented and those who did not supplement vitamin D. Conclusion Patients with T1DM are more at risk of developing osteoporosis than healthy individuals. Vitamin D may not be the only factor affecting BMD. Patients with T1DM should be screened for osteoporosis and other complications. Patients with type 1 diabetes should receive higher doses of vitamin D than healthy adults and control their calcium, magnesium and phosphates serum concentrations.",

    "Abstract": "Background Oral immunotherapy (OIT) has emerged as a promising food allergy treatment with significant evidence of increased efficacy in preschool-aged children. However, current OIT protocols are generally burdensome and focus on single food allergies, while many children have multiple food allergies. A feasibility-oriented approach that minimizes the impact of therapy while allowing both single and multiple food allergy treatment is important to enhance accessibility for routine clinical practice. This study assesses the safety of a feasibility-oriented OIT protocol in preschool-aged children with single and multiple food allergies. Methods This single-center prospective intervention study included children aged 9–24 months with proven food allergy (sensitization and a positive oral food challenge (OFC)). After a short dose escalation phase, children received one year of low-dose (300 mg protein/day) OIT, followed by an exit OFC four weeks after stopping therapy. Children with multiple food allergies received OIT for up to four allergens. Each allergen treatment is referred to as an OIT trajectory. Allergic dosing reactions (ADR) were recorded and classified using Sampson's severity score (grades I-V). Results Between May 2019 and Oct 2022, 124 children (median age 17 months, IQR 11–20 months) started OIT for 189 food allergies. Peanut ( n = 52), cashew nut ( n = 46) and egg ( n = 38) allergies were the most common. The median number of hospital-based dose escalations per patient was three (IQR 2–5). ADR occurred in 89 children and 117 OIT trajectories, most frequently during dose escalation (48.1%). Most reactions (95.3%) were mild (Sampson I-II) and resolved spontaneously (55.6%) or with antihistamines (29.9%). Ten reactions were severe (Sampson III-IV), of which one required epinephrine. Ten trajectories were discontinued due to side effects. Conclusions Our novel feasibility-oriented OIT protocol appears safe for various allergens and multifood OIT in preschool-aged children. Side effects were common but typically mild. However, they may lead to therapy discontinuation. Clinical Trial Registration https://www.onderzoekmetmensen.nl/en/trial/49735 , identifier NL7663.",

    "Abstract": "This investigation aimed to explore novel theoretical aspects and applications of the information-generating function measure for order statistics. We developed fundamental properties and established stochastic ordering relationships based on this information-theoretic measure. Our analysis demonstrated that when two order statistics share identical information-generating measures, their underlying parent distributions can be uniquely identified. We implemented our proposed measure to characterize the exponential distribution. Moreover, we derived bounds and investigated monotonicity properties for these functional measures. The study further examined how information-generating functions characterize distributional symmetry, with particular applications to uniform and normal distributions for identifying symmetry points of order statistics. Building on these theoretical foundations, we proposed a new symmetry test statistic derived from the information-generating properties of the order statistics. Using comprehensive Monte Carlo simulations, we evaluated the test's statistical power against existing alternatives. The present results demonstrated superior performance across various asymmetric distributional alternatives. The practical utility of our methodology is illustrated through an empirical analysis of chronic disease prevalence data.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Stress shielding is a major cause of radiological changes in the humeral component, which is commonly evident in cementless stems of reverse shoulder implants. The bulkiness of the humeral stem results in less load being transmitted to the bone, curtailing bone remodeling. Designing an implant with adequate strength and a suitable material that matches the mechanical properties of bone can help prevent the implant migration or loosening, thereby lowering bone resorption. Methods Humeral stems with no porosity and varied porosities, such as circular, elliptical, and trabecular architecture, were designed using 316L stainless steel and titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V). Finite element analysis (FEA) was conducted on eight bone–implant assemblies under four loading conditions for cortical and trabecular bones. Weighted mean of von Mises stress and mechanobiology associated with the strain energy densities were studied. This serves as a precursor in predicting the effect of stress shielding. Results The titanium implant with trabecular architecture was mechanically close to the intact bone compared to the other varied porosity designs. It also had better load-bearing capacity than the solid stems. Discussion These investigations help understand the load-bearing capacity of reverse shoulder humeral stems and ascertain the importance of combining the design and material in enhancing implant stability and longevity.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Given the high prevalence of vertebral fractures following radiotherapy in patients with metastatic spine disease, torso muscle segmentation is necessary for biomechanical modeling of vertebral loading, permitting individualized evaluation of fracture risk. Methods In this study, we developed and validated a deep-learning model for full volumetric segmentation of the thoracic and abdominal spinal musculature in cancer patients with metastatic spine disease from sparsely annotated clinical CT image data. We obtained CT data for 148 metastatic spine disease patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment, and an external set of randomly selected 30 subjects from the National Lung Screening Trial. We extracted 1924 axial CT images at the midpoint of each vertebral level (T4 to L4) and manually labeled the key extensor and flexor muscles (up to 8 muscles per side) at each level. We trained a 2D nnU-Net deep-learning (DL) model to segment each muscle and, using these sparse annotations, trained the model to segment each muscle’s 3D volume per spine. Two experienced radiologists independently and blindly evaluated the anatomical fidelity of the segmentations using a Likert scale, for 1) manual- and 2) DL-segmentation, 3) random test samples from the muscle’s 3D volume and 4) an external NLST CT data. Results The DL method achieved comparable performance to manual segmentations with a mean Dice score above 0.769. Mann-Whitney test analysis showed that the radiologist ratings of DL-generated muscle segmentations were noninferior to the manual segmentation for each muscle. Discussion Demonstrating excellent performance for rapid, high-anatomical fidelity 3D segmentation of the main flexor, extensor, and stabilizing thoracolumbar muscles, the DL model from clinical CT scans, this development holds significant potential for reducing the manual effort required to generate individualized musculoskeletal models in cancer patients.",

    "Abstract": "Total joint arthroplasty consistently alleviates pain and improves function in patients with end-stage joint disease. Nevertheless, up to 10% of hip and 20% of knee recipients remain dissatisfied after surgery, and registry data indicate that approximately one in five implants requires revision within 25 years, most commonly due to aseptic loosening, mechanical instability, or periprosthetic joint infection. Conventional postoperative surveillance relies on intermittent clinic visits and imaging, leaving a critical blind spot in our understanding of implant performance during daily activities. To address this gap, research has turned to fully implantable smart prostheses, such as hip and knee implants, embedded with sensors and low-power wireless telemetry that enable real-time monitoring of in vivo conditions. This review traces the evolution from early instrumented prototypes to the first commercially available smart knee; outlines enabling technologies, including sensing, communication, powering, and system integration; and summarizes clinical applications and early human data across this development continuum. Smart implants capture objective in vivo parameters that are not accessible to routine follow-up, including joint loads, range of motion, spatiotemporal gait metrics, and temperature, thereby enabling orthopedic phenotyping through dynamic, longitudinal digital representations of recovery trajectories and complication patterns. Fully implantable smart prostheses have the potential to shift arthroplasty toward continuous remote monitoring and proactive, precision follow-up care. Coupled with robust clinical decision-support systems and rigorous long-term evaluation, these technologies may usher in a new era of intelligent joint arthroplasty, with the potential to improve outcomes and extend implant longevity.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study compares the biomechanical performance of InterTan nails of three lengths (180 mm, 240 mm, and 320 mm) in treating AO/OTA 31A2.3 comminuted intertrochanteric fractures, which are highly unstable and prone to fixation failure. The research question focuses on identifying the nail length that optimizes stress distribution, displacement, and strain to enhance fracture healing and reduce failure risk, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for clinical decision-making. Methods Femoral CT images from a healthy 24-year-old male were used to reconstruct cortical and cancellous bone models in Mimics Research 21.0 and Geomagic Wrap 2021. A complete femur and AO/OTA 31A2.3 fracture model were constructed in SolidWorks 2022. InterTan models (180 mm, 240 mm, and 320 mm) were assembled with the fracture model, and finite element analysis (FEA) was performed in Ansys Workbench 18.0 under three loading conditions (standing, walking, and stair descent) to evaluate stress, deformation, and failure risk. Results Stress concentrated at the nail-screw junction and proximal aperture, with the 180 mm nail exhibiting the highest stress, the 320 mm nail the lowest, and the 240 mm nail intermediate values. Displacement increased with nail length under dynamic loads, whereas the 180 mm nail minimized displacement during standing. The 240 mm nail showed the lowest strain during standing but the highest during stair descent. Differences in stress and displacement were statistically significant (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion The 320 mm nail optimizes stress distribution, micromotion, and strain, thereby reducing failure risk and promoting healing. These findings align with biological osteosynthesis principles and support personalized treatment strategies.",

Recently, human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell exosomes (hADSCs-Exo) have emerged as a cell-free therapeutic strategy for promoting burn wound healing. These nano-sized particles function through various mechanisms, including promoting cellular migration, angiogenesis, inflammation reduction, immune response modulation, collagen remodeling, and scar prevention. They exert these effects by activating critical signaling pathways such as PI3K/Akt, IL-17RA/Smad, and mTOR. This review summarizes the biological characteristics and research relevance of hADSCs-Exo in burn injury management and discusses their translational implications.",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation (OTCT) is an important fertility preservation method for female cancer patients; however, its efficacy is limited by post-transplantation ischemia–reperfusion injury, leading to oxidative stress, apoptosis, and fibrosis that impair ovarian reserve and graft function. Mesenchymal stem cell–conditioned medium shows therapeutic potential through paracrine actions, but clinical use is restricted by relatively limited antioxidant capacity and delivery challenges. To address this, an antioxidant-enriched hydrogel (PG-gel) was developed from N-acetylcysteine–modified gelatin and poly (ethylene glycol) succinimidyl succinate, loaded with conditioned medium from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (CM-UCMSCs). This study evaluated the efficacy of PG-gel in protecting vitrified–thawed ovarian tissue during in vitro culture. The CM-UCMSCs-loaded PG-gel significantly suppressed intracellular reactive oxygen species generation. The PG + CM-UCMSCs group showed markedly reduced follicle loss, improved follicle morphology, decreased collagen deposition, lower apoptosis (fewer TUNEL-positive cells and reduced caspase-3 expression), diminished oxidative damage (lower 8-OHdG), and enhanced glucose consumption compared with the other culture groups. Transcriptomic analysis revealed downregulation of apoptosis-related genes (e.g., Ddit3, Trib3 and Hmox1) and upregulation of mitochondrial metabolism genes (e.g., Mt-atp8, Mt-nd1 and Mt-cyb). In conclusion, the PG + CM-UCMSCs system provided comprehensive protection to cryopreserved ovarian tissue by mitigating oxidative stress, fibrosis, and apoptosis, likely through regulation of apoptotic signaling and enhancement of mitochondrial energy metabolism, thereby offering a promising strategy to improve OTCT outcomes.",

This study systematically integrates blockchain technology for secure, transparent transactions with reinforcement learning (RL)-optimized Neutrosophic multi-regression for precise crop loss prediction in multicropping systems. Using real-world data from six crops (rice, banana, turmeric, elephant foot yam, coconut, cocoa), Neutrosophic multi-regression estimated losses with RL hyperparameter tuning, achieving superior prediction accuracy. A blockchain framework was developed for farmer validation, transaction security, and smart contract execution using Ethereum/Ganache. Results demonstrate 25%–35% reduction in predicted crop losses and enhanced supply chain traceability.

    "Abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) modeling is essential for reliable seismic assessment of concrete dams, as it captures canyon topography, monolith interactions, and joint nonlinearity that cannot be represented in two-dimensional (2D) analyses. This study systematically evaluates the seismic performance of a benchmark concrete gravity dam through comparative 3D and 2D finite element (FE) analyses, investigating two free-field foundation modeling approaches: (i) a direct FE method that explicitly accounts for canyon geometry, and (ii) an analytical approach employing simplified flat foundation assumptions. Using the domain reduction method, the nonlinear seismic analysis of the Pine Flat Dam implements effective earthquake forces as seismic input at the absorbing boundaries. The results reveal that while 2D analyses show methodological agreement (both relying on one-dimensional free-field assumptions), they fundamentally cannot reproduce 3D effects such as stress amplification from canyon geometry and monolith interactions. The direct FE method proves superior in predicting joint sliding and opening responses, as well as canyon amplification effects, whereas simplified approaches yield non-conservative estimates due to its failure to account for canyon-induced wave scattering. This study concludes that 2D modeling may be sufficient for preliminary analyses, but final design verification requires 3D simulation with direct FE free-field representation, particularly for dams located in irregular topographies.",

Randomized evidence in patients with T2DM remains limited. This trial evaluates the effects of GLP-1RAs on nicotine dependence and smoking exposure and explores potential neural mechanisms using functional MRI (fMRI). Methods and analysis This single-center, parallel-group randomized controlled trial will enroll 46 male adults with T2DM who are current smokers with Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score ≥4. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive a GLP-1RA or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) for 24 weeks as part of routine glucose-lowering therapy optimization. No structured smoking cessation counseling or smoking cessation pharmacotherapy will be provided by the research team. The primary endpoint is change in FTND score from baseline, assessed at weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, and 24. Secondary endpoints include changes in exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) and smoking cessation rate at weeks 12 and 24, and changes in metabolic parameters. Exploratory endpoints include changes in resting-state fMRI measures from baseline to week 24 and their associations with smoking- and metabolic-related outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Therapeutic resistance remains a major barrier to effective treatment in colorectal cancer (CRC), where the tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in modulating responses to chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapies. This review synthesizes current evidence on how cellular and non-cellular TME components contribute to resistance mechanisms in CRC. Key immune cells, including T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, orchestrate immunosuppressive networks that impair drug efficacy. For instance, regulatory T cells and M2-polarized macrophages promote chemoresistance via cytokine secretion and metabolic reprogramming, while neutrophils and myeloid-derived suppressor cells hinder immune checkpoint blockade through extracellular trap formation and T-cell exhaustion. Non-cellular elements, such as extracellular matrix remodeling, hypoxia-induced metabolic shifts, and dysregulated cytokines like IL-6 and TGF-β, further exacerbate resistance by fostering epithelial-mesenchymal transition and angiogenesis. Tables highlight specific molecular axes and therapeutic implications. By elucidating these interactions, this article underscores the potential of TME-targeted strategies, such as macrophage reprogramming, cytokine inhibition, and combination therapies, to overcome resistance and improve clinical outcomes in CRC patients. Future research should prioritize integrating TME biomarkers for personalized treatment approaches.",

    "Abstract": "Macroautophagy is essential for the long-term health of neurons and astrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS). The six mammalian ATG8 paralogs (LC3A/B/C and GABARAP/GABARAPL1/L2) exhibit an emerging “ATG8 code”—a division of labor among these proteins that assigns specialized roles in the autophagy pathway to each paralog, enabling fine-tuned proteostasis at synapses and the astrocyte–neuron interface. This review synthesizes how LC3 versus GABARAP mediate distinct steps of autophagy (LC3 primarily governs cargo recruitment and phagophore expansion, whereas GABARAP drives autophagosome maturation, transport, and lysosomal fusion) and how these molecular distinctions translate into functional differences in neurons versus astrocytes. Neurons coordinate autophagy across long axons and synapses: presynaptic autophagy clears aging synaptic vesicles and organelles, while postsynaptic autophagy modulates receptor turnover and synaptic plasticity. Astrocytes, by contrast, leverage autophagy for metabolic support and clearance of extracellular debris (e.g., amyloid-β plaques), interfacing with neuronal autophagy via transcellular mechanisms. Dysregulation of these processes underlies diverse CNS disorders: impaired autophagic flux and aggregate clearance contribute to neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s), whereas selective autophagy deficits at synapses disrupt circuit homeostasis (implicated in epilepsy and autism). Finally, we highlight emerging methodologies—from multi-omics and live imaging to optogenetics and targeted therapeutics—that are illuminating this specialized autophagy network and opening novel avenues for intervention.",

    "Abstract": "Thyroid dysfunction is a common endocrine disease among women of childbearing age, which seriously affects reproductive health. From an immunological perspective, this in-depth analysis clarifies the complex relationship between thyroid function and female reproduction. We studied the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis regulation by thyroid hormones through direct and indirect mechanisms, including metabolic mediators such as prolactin and leptin. Recent studies have shown that inflammatory cytokines (IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF-α) severely disrupt the production pathways of thyroid hormones, establishing an essential link between immune activation and reproductive problems. Since the placenta serves as an active immune interface affected by thyroid activity, there are significant physiological obstacles (including increased iodine clearance and elevated deiodinase activity), immunological challenges (such as altered cytokine profiles), and pathological barriers to optimal thyroid adaptation during pregnancy. This literature review indicates that thyroid problems substantially affect reproductive outcomes by altering the immune response at the maternal-fetal interface, influencing placental development, trophoblast invasion, and vascular remodeling. This review addresses a notable research deficiency through a modern perspective on thyroid dysfunction and reproductive issues, especially inflammatory cytokines related to preeclampsia. We believe that thyroid dysfunction can alter the expression of specific angiogenic factors (including sFlt-1, PlGF, and VEGF) and modify the immune cell profile at the maternal-fetal interface (particularly NK cells, macrophages, and T regulatory cells), creating a new framework for understanding and addressing thyroid-related reproductive diseases through targeted immunomodulatory strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Pseudorabies virus (PRV), a significant pathogen of swine, causes substantial economic losses, and even poses an emergent public health concern due to its zoonotic potential. The continuous evolution of PRV has undermined the effectiveness of current vaccines and antiviral drugs. Consequently, there is an urgent need to develop novel strategies to curb its spread. Methods The inhibitory effect of garcinone C on PRV replication was assessed in vivo and in vitro . To determine the stage of antiviral action, treatments were administered at different time points: pre-treatment, co-treatment, and post-infection. RNA sequencing was performed, and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Results In the study, we found that garcinone C inhibited PRV replication in a concentration- and timedependent manner in vitro. The antiviral activity of garcinone C was specific to post-infection administration and did not extend to pre-treatment and cotreatment conditions. Transcriptomic analysis identified DEGs between garcinone C- and vehicle-treated cells after PRV infection. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of the DEGs indicated that the antiviral effect of garcinone C was primarily associated with the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, potentially through the downregulation of the host epidermal growth factor. Furthermore, garcinone C suppressed the production of key inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-a during PRV infection. Oral administration of garcinone C conferred protection in PRVinfected mice, leading to attenuated weight loss, an improved survival rate, as well as reduced pathological changes and viral loads in tissues. Discussion Collectively, our findings identify garcinone C as a promising therapeutic candidate against PRV and elucidate its underlying molecular mechanism.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Leptospira interrogans and represents a major public health and veterinary concern. The persistence of the pathogen is closely associated with biofilm formation, yet targeted therapeutics are currently unavailable. The GroEL chaperonin, a conserved protein involved in biofilm formation and immunogenicity, was investigated as a potential therapeutic target. Methods A structure-based virtual screening approach was performed using a library of 543,503 natural compounds from the Life Chemicals database. Top-ranked ligands were evaluated using molecular docking and physicochemical and pharmacokinetic property analyses. Density functional theory calculations were performed to assess electronic stability, followed by molecular dynamics simulations to evaluate ligand–protein complex stability. Principal component analysis and MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations were subsequently applied to characterize conformational dynamics and binding affinity. Results Five compounds (F3385-2019, F1243-0200, F3139-0927, F2801-0179, and F1864-0208) exhibited strong binding affinities toward GroEL, with docking energies ranging from −10.34 to −8.26 kcal/mol. All shortlisted compounds complied with Lipinski’s Rule of Five and demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA analyses indicated stable ligand–protein interactions. Among the candidates, F1864–0208 and F1243–0200 emerged as the most stable and promising leads, whereas the remaining compounds showed moderate inhibition. Discussion This study provides computational evidence supporting GroEL as a viable drug target in L. interrogans . The identified natural compounds may represent promising scaffolds for the development of novel anti-leptospiral agents. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to validate their therapeutic efficacy and safety.",

    "Abstract": "Background Pediatric acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI) constitutes a major global health threat. Since 2020, global containment measures have disrupted pathogen circulation patterns, leading to altered epidemiological profiles across multiple pathogens with marked regional heterogeneity. Current research in Ningbo predominantly focuses on single-pathogen surveillance or short-term monitoring, lacking systematic analysis of multi-pathogen interactive dynamics, age-specific susceptibility mechanisms, and co-infections. Methods Clinical data from all 191,967 pediatric patients with ARTI at Ningbo LiHuili Hospital (2020–2024) were collected. Laboratory testing including influenza A/B virus (IFV-A/B) detection, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) testing, 13 respiratory pathogens analysis, and bacterial culture was systematically integrated and analyzed. Results From 2020 and 2024, the number of ARTI cases initially increased and then decreased, peaking in 2023. The incidence was highest in autumn and lowest in summer. Among all cases, 75,001 (39.07%) were diagnosed with acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI), with children aged 6 years exhibiting the highest susceptibility. Of the 41,766 cases tested, the overall pathogen detection rate was 67.61%. IFV-A/B, Human Parainfluenza Virus (HPIV), and Human Adenovirus (HAdV) were more frequently detected in acute upper respiratory tract infections (AURI) ( P &amp;lt; 0.05), while Human Rhinovirus (HRV), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), and MP were predominantly identified in ALRI cases ( P &amp;lt; 0.05). Each pathogen exhibited age-specific susceptibility patterns. Several pathogens, such as IFV-A, MP, and HAdV, displayed distinctive epidemic peaks. Co-infections were common, with a 17.38% co-infection rate observed in the group tested for 13 respiratory pathogens, and a higher co-infection rate of 39.49% when testing combined respiratory pathogens and bacteria. Correlation analysis among pathogens revealed predominant antagonistic interactions between viruses, positive associations among bacteria, and generally positive interactions between viruses and bacteria, though overall correlation strengths were weak. Conclusion Pediatric ARTI exhibit age-specific susceptibility and pathogen variation. The 2023–2024 resurgence demands precision control strategies for optimized intervention.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Shewanella species ( Shewanella spp.) were emerging and rare pathogens. Very few studies had focused on Shewanella spp. infection due to its low incidence. A retrospective analysis summarizing clinical and laboratory characteristics of Shewanella spp. infection at a tertiary hospital in Hefei City was conducted to learn more about the rare bacterium. Methods A total of 36 patients with Shewanella spp. infection from October 2019 to February 2025 were included. The data of all patients were collected by reviewing electronic records. Results Among 36 isolated strains, 77.8% were Shewanella algae and 22.2% were Shewanella putrefaciens . Abdominal pain was the most common clinical symptom. Intrahepatic stone and cholangitis was the main diagnosed disease. According to the type of main diagnosed disease, they were divided into two groups: hepatobiliary disease group and non-hepatobiliary disease group. The laboratory results were analyzed, and it was revealed that the laboratory characteristics of anemia, neutrophilia, leukocytosis, and so on were common. Serum coagulation tests results showed that it was significantly higher than the normal value, and all other serum biochemical and coagulation tests results were mostly normal. For microorganism culture, co-infection microorganisms were obtained. Shewanella spp. were usually susceptible to aminoglycoside, quinolone, cephalosporin, carbapenems, and compound antibiotics. All patients were treated with antibiotics, and there were one or more types of antibiotics to use, all of whom had effective treatment outcomes. Discussion Shewanella spp. infections were very limited. The study might improve the attention and awareness of the rare bacterial infection.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives Although Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis (DTaP) vaccines have been used in the U.S. for decades and have extensive safety records, a comprehensive post-marketing assessment for all available types is still needed. This study leveraged the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database to evaluate adverse events following immunization (AEFI) and analyze potential associations with vaccine administration. Methods We extracted all reports of adverse events (AEs) following DTaP vaccination from the VAERS database for the period 1990 to May 2025. Our analysis included descriptive statistics to summarize patient demographics and clinical features, and disproportionality methods to identify potential safety signals. Results During the study period, the VAERS database documented 57,341 children under 7 years who received DTaP vaccines, corresponding to 57,368 administered doses and 193,955 adverse event (AE) reports. AE reporting was more frequent in males (52.46%) than females (45.07%), with more than half of the cases (50.44%) involving children under 2 years old. The most common clinical outcomes were recovery (62.53%) and hospitalization (10.29%). Most AEs (89.61%) occurred within 0–30 days after vaccination, with a median onset time of 1.0 days. Infanrix (37.95%) and Daptacel (25.04%) were the most frequently reported vaccine types. Disproportionality analysis detected 158 positive AE signals across 24 system organ classes (SOCs). Among all SAEs, pyrexia (ROR = 1.01) was the most frequently reported, followed by convulsion (ROR = 1.82) and vomiting (ROR = 1.05). The most common signals for non-SAEs included injection site erythema (ROR = 3.79), injection site swelling (ROR = 3.00), and erythema (ROR = 3.03). Conclusions This post-marketing surveillance indicates that most reported AEs were non-serious and occurred within 30 days following vaccination. These findings support the known safety profile of DTaP vaccines and highlight identifiable timing patterns of AEs, which may help inform monitoring strategies and benefit-risk assessments after immunization.",

    "Abstract": "Calf diarrhea is a common gastrointestinal disease that usually occurs within one month of birth. The disease causes the greatest economic losses to the cattle industry. Currently, a variety of diagnostic methods have been developed for calf diarrhea infections. However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory in terms of sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, cost, and speed.To provide a more sensitive, specific, simpler, and faster detection method, we recently developed an RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay that can detect BVDV, BCoV, BRV, and ETEC infections in cattle on-site. Testing for each pathogen is performed in a single test tube, without the need to open the tube in the middle, and can be completed in under 50 minutes.The RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay can detect BVDV, BCoV, BRV, and ETEC at concentrations of at least 10 copies/μL. The RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay does not produce false-positive results due to the presence of other pathogens. The sensitivity of BCoV, BRV, and ETEC in the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a quadruple assay is equivalent to that of single qPCR. The sensitivity of BVDV in the quadruple assay is slightly lower than that of the single qPCR method.Due to its sensitivity, specificity, simplicity, and rapidity, the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay is more practical for on-site detection of cattle diarrhea pathogens than any existing detection method.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To explore the clinical significance of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) technology in diagnosing and treating periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) following total hip arthroplasty (THA). Methods From September 2018 to September 2024, 15 patients with periprosthetic infection after total hip arthroplasty were admitted. There were 11 males and 4 females; ages ranged from 28 to 87 years old, with an average of 63 years old. Infection occurred 6 to 42 months after total hip arthroplasty, with an average of 22.7 months. The infection lasted between 15 and 115 days, averaging 37.6 days. After being admitted to the hospital, joint fluid was collected for bacterial culture and mNGS. Following admission, joint fluid was collected for bacterial culture and mNGS, and antibiotics were adjusted based on the results, with surgery used to control the infection if needed. Results Bacterial culture method was positive in 10 cases (66.7%), with a total of 12 pathogenic bacteria types detected. MNGS was positive in 15 cases (100.0%), with a total of 19 pathogenic bacteria types detected. There was a statistically significant difference in the positive rate between the two methods (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Out of the 10 patients, 5 who tested positive using both the bacterial culture method and mNGS test showed identical pathogenic bacterial types, resulting in a 50.0% compliance rate. The testing time (from sample delivery to results) was (3.07 ± 0.96) days for bacterial culture method and (1.67 ± 0.49) days for mNGS test, and the difference was statistically significant (t=5.03, P&amp;lt;0.001). The patients were followed up for 13 to 82 months, with a mean of 40.7 months. In one patient, the infection returned three months after undergoing one-stage revision surgery, while the other 14 patients showed no signs of infection, resulting in an infection control rate of 93.3%. Conclusion MNGS can detect the pathogenic bacteria of postoperative PJI after THA more quickly and accurately than the bacterial culture method, which is crucial for guiding antibiotic and surgical treatment combinations for patients with postoperative PJI after THA.",

    "Abstract": "Objective The research aims to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms of Candida parapsilosis infection after keratoplasty and provide evidence-based guidance for the clinical management of Candida infections in ophthalmic practice. Method Biofilms were cultured from 45 strains of Candida . The total biomass of the biofilms was measured using the crystal violet staining method, and the biofilm activity was assessed via the XTT reduction assay. Cell surface hydrophobicity and adhesion were evaluated for all Candida strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of planktonic Candida was determined using the colorimetric microbroth dilution method, while the MIC of biofilm-embedded Candida was measured via the XTT reduction assay. The release of 1, 3-β-D-glucan was detected using the G-test, and the chemotactic ability of 1, 3-β-D-glucan on neutrophils was evaluated via the Transwell assay. Molecular typing of Candida parapsilosis was performed using microsatellite genotyping. Statistical analysis was conducted using the Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) test. Results In 45 postoperative ocular Candida isolates, Candida parapsilosis accounted for 48.9% (22/45), Candida albicans 35.6% (16/45), Candida tropicalis 11.1% (5/45), and Candida glabrata 4.4% (2/45). The total biofilm biomass and metabolic activity of Candida parapsilosis at 4°C were significantly higher than those of the other Candida species. In the cell surface hydrophobicity assay, Candida parapsilosis was more hydrophobic than Candida albicans and Candida glabrata , but less hydrophobic than Candida tropicalis . Among Candida parapsilosis isolates, 77.3% (17/22) showed strong adhesion ability and 81.8% (18/22) showed strong biofilm-forming ability (OD450&amp;gt;0.16). Candida colony and spore morphology were found to correlate with biofilm-forming ability. Strains with strong biofilm-forming ability had wrinkled, dry colonies; Gram-stained spores appeared as pseudohyphae; and lactophenol cotton blue staining showed spores that were uniformly and deeply stained. In the biofilm-antigenicity analysis, the non-biofilm-forming group’s 1, 3-β-D-glucan release was significantly higher than that of the strong biofilm group, thereby attracting more neutrophils. In antifungal susceptibility tests, except for C. tropicalis , biofilm-grown Candida showed higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) than planktonic cells for all antifungal drugs. Caspofungin was active against all isolates in both states. Conclusions This study demonstrates that C. parapsilosis has greater adhesion ability and a stronger capacity to form biofilms at 4°C (with higher metabolic activity) than other Candida species. When laboratory findings reveal a Candida isolate with a rough colony morphology, its biofilm-forming ability should be tested and antifungal susceptibility should be assessed under biofilm-growing conditions rather than in planktonic culture.Clinically, we recommend shifting antifungal therapy to caspofungin for such infections.",

    "Abstract": "Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is known as an autologous biological agent that can immensely promote wound healing. Bacterial infection is a common complication of wounds which obstructs wound healing. However, the effect of PRP on bacteria is still inconclusive. This in vitro study evaluated the antibacterial activity of PRP, platelet-poor plasma (PPP) and Frozen-PRP (Fro-PRP) against Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Enterobacter cloacae , Staphylococcus aureus , and Enterococcus faecalis . The antimicrobial activity was performed using modified agar diffusion method, colony-forming units counting test, and bacterial growth curve analysis. The results showed that PRP, PPP and Fro-PRP had antimicrobial effects on five bacterial strains including Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , Enterobacter cloacae , Staphylococcus aureus , and Enterococcus faecalis . The antimicrobial activity of PRP was significantly stronger than that of Fro-PRP and PPP. To a certain extent, frozen storage may reduce the antibacterial ability of PRP. Overall, our study demonstrates that PRP and other platelet derived products seem to be a promising alternative tool for infected wounds treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Esports has rapidly transformed from a niche digital pastime into a global cultural industry with increasing diplomatic relevance. This study examines how esports operates as a tool of soft power, public diplomacy, and nation branding across four key countries—South Korea, China, the United States, and India—each reflecting distinct governance structures, platform ecosystems, and strategic communication logics. Drawing on contemporary research in soft power, sports diplomacy, and media globalization, the study shows that esports now functions as a youth-driven, digitally mediated channel of international influence. Comparative analysis reveals that South Korea integrates esports into the Hallyu cultural wave; China uses a state-led model tied to digital nationalism and platform sovereignty; the United States projects corporate soft power through global publishers and streaming platforms; and India leverages esports within its Digital India modernization framework. The study identifies core challenges, including governance fragmentation, legitimacy disputes, over-commercialization, integrity risks, and social stigma. It also highlights emerging opportunities in AI-enhanced integrity systems, metaverse-based competitions, and multilateral governance initiatives such as the Olympic Esports Series. Ultimately, the study argues that control over global distribution platforms is becoming as important as game development itself, positioning esports as a transformative diplomatic arena for shaping national identity, cultural visibility, and youth-oriented international engagement.",

    "Abstract": "This study analyzes agency and news values across verbal and visual modalities in Croatian online news on the climate crisis, examining how climate change is portrayed. We explore newsworthiness, visual framing, and metaphor, linking agency to broader concerns about responsibility. In addition, the analysis traces how different types of agency shape news values in both metaphorical and non-metaphorical micro-contexts. To achieve our goals, we employ four theoretical frameworks: Halliday and Matthiessen’s Transitivity model; Conceptual Metaphor Theory as developed by Lakoff and Johnson and subsequently extended by Forceville, Steen et al., and Hart; Bednarek and Caple’s news values analysis framework; and the climate-change visual framing approach developed by O’Neill et al. The findings reveal a contradictory picture. Croatian online media primarily evoke worry, reinforced by the news values of Impact and Negativity and by frequent portrayals of humanity as the Goal in both texts and images. Metaphorical framings follow a clear pattern: individuals appear as victims facing stronger adversaries, while abstract entities such as the climate crisis and climate change are depicted as malevolent agents in a dominant war scenario. News stories rarely highlight initiatives that might foster a sense of agency. Most articles present climate change as a global problem and use images of places distant from, or only loosely related to, Croatia. The result is a narrative that feels remote and insufficiently relevant to the average reader.",

    "Abstract": "Background Insulin resistance (IR) has been shown to be associated with hypertension. The triglyceride-glucose body mass index (TyG-BMI) has emerged as a novel surrogate marker for assessing IR. This study aimed to investigate the association between the TyG-BMI index and hypertension among adults in rural southwest China using a cross-sectional study. Method We recruited 2,998 people between the ages of 30 and 79 from Rongchang, Chongqing municipality, southwest China, as part of The China Multi-Ethnic Cohort Study, considered the largest cohort study in southwest China. Logistic regression model, restricted cubic spline (RCS) model and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were applied to estimate the association between the TyG-BMI index and hypertension. Moreover, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were undertaken to check the consistency of the outcomes. Results A total of 2,998 participants were included in the present study, with a hypertension prevalence of 39.93%. After adjusting for confounding factors, the ORs of hypertension in Q2, Q3, Q4 were 1.641 (1.277–2.109), 1.768 (1.371–2.281), 2.463 (1.794–3.382) compared with the lowest quartile (Q1), respectively. RCS indicated that the TyG-BMI index was nonlinearly associated with hypertension ( P for overall &amp;lt; 0.001, P for nonlinea r = 0.046). The ROC analysis indicated that the TyG-BMI index had a 64.1% (AUC: 0.641, 95% CI: 0.621–0.661) ability to distinguish hypertension. Subgroup analysis in participants without diabetes, dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia and central obesity as well as sensitivity analyses also demonstrated the similar relationship between the TyG-BMI index and hypertension. Conclusion The current study demonstrates that the TyG-BMI index is associated with higher risk of hypertension among rural adults in southwest China. Lifestyle modifications, including weight control, vigorous physical activity and healthy dietary pattern can help improve IR and prevent hypertension.",

The treatment success rate, treatment efficiency, incidence of adverse events, and nursing satisfaction were compared between the two groups. Results The treatment success rate in the study group was 100% (85/85), which was higher than the control group's rate of 92.59% (75/81), with a statistically significant difference ( P = .03). The study group had shorter triage time, diagnosis time, emergency stay time, referral time to intensive care unit (ICU), and symptom remission time compared to the control group, with statistically significant differences ( P &amp;lt; .001). The total incidence of adverse events in the study group was 3.53% (3/85), significantly lower than the control group's rate of 12.00% (9/75), and the total family nursing satisfaction in the study group was 96.47% (82/85), significantly higher than the control group's rate of 87.65% (71/81), with statistically significant differences ( P = .04). Conclusion The “smart + specialty” integrated treatment model can improve treatment efficiency and success rates in emergency AoD patients, reduce the risk of adverse events, and enhance family nursing satisfaction.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Anomalous aortic origin of a coronary artery (AAOCA) is associated with sudden cardiac death. The intramural (IM) length is considered high-risk, yet radiologic measurements by computed tomography angiography (CTA) show variable agreement with measurements at surgery. We aimed to develop a semi-automatic computational method to estimate IM length in a retrospective cohort of surgical AAOCA patients. Methods In 58 patients [49 right(R), 9 left(L)], CTA images were used to generate 3D segmentations of the aorta and a centerline of the anomalous coronary. The distance from the centerline to the aortic segmentation was calculated. The IM length was estimated from a transition point in the derivative of the distance curve and compared to radiologic and surgical measurements. Results Our method demonstrated an overall root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3.4 mm, comparable to radiologic estimates (3.2 mm). For L-AAOCA subjects, our method showed lower root-mean-square error compared to radiologic estimates (our method: 3.6 mm, radiologic: 4.7 mm). For R-AAOCA subjects, the RMSE was higher in our method compared to radiologic estimates (our method: 3.4 mm, radiologic: 2.8 mm). Conclusion This is a pilot study of a computational approach to measure intramural length that is shown to be accurate relative to surgical measurements. Computational methods that represent and quantify morphology, including acute take-off angle, ostial characteristics, minimal luminal area, and intramural length, may be helpful for risk stratification and surgical planning in AAOCA.",

    "Abstract": "Background The monocyte-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (MHR) has emerged as a novel biomarker for cardiovascular outcomes. However, its role in atrial fibrillation (AF) remains unclear. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of MHR in predicting AF risk. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science up to March 20, 2025. The primary outcome was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of MHR for predicting AF using summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve analysis. The secondary outcome was to explore the relationship between MHR and AF risk. Pooled odds ratio (OR), sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. Results A total of 13 studies comprising 5,499 participants were included. Elevated MHR was independently associated with an increased AF risk (OR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.11–1.31; P &amp;lt; 0.001). The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.71–0.93) and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.60–0.75), yielding an area under the SROC curve of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.76–0.83). Subgroup analyses revealed significant diagnostic performance variations by AF phenotype: MHR had the highest sensitivity (0.91; 95% CI 0.74–1.00) and AUC (0.94; 95% CI 0.91–0.96) in non-procedural AF, followed by post-ablation recurrence (sensitivity = 0.86, AUC = 0.83) and new-onset AF (sensitivity = 0.80, AUC = 0.83). Large-sample studies (&amp;gt;600) showed lower sensitivity (0.71 vs. 0.90) but higher specificity (0.78 vs. 0.60) than small-sample studies (≤600). No significant publication bias was detected ( p = 0.45). Conclusions MHR demonstrates moderate diagnostic accuracy for AF risk prediction and is better suited as a screening or complementary biomarker than a standalone diagnostic tool. Its diagnostic performance varies significantly by AF phenotype and clinical context. Given the limited number of studies, significant heterogeneity, and unstandardized MHR cut-offs, large-scale prospective studies with standardized protocols are warranted to validate these findings and facilitate targeted clinical application.

    "Abstract": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a rare but severe complication of heparin therapy, characterized by a significant reduction in platelet count and a paradoxical prothrombotic state, which increases the risks of both arterial and venous thrombosis. This case report describes a 58-year-old male patient with multi-vessel coronary artery disease who developed acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) following successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Despite initial successful revascularization, the patient experienced recurrent chest pain, and HIT was clinically suspected based on a significant drop in platelet count and the 4Ts scoring system, though confirmatory anti-PF4/heparin antibody testing was unavailable at our institution. Treatment with corticosteroids was initiated; however, following transfer to another hospital, the patient received platelet transfusion—a contraindicated intervention in HIT—and subsequently succumbed to a fatal arrhythmic event. This case highlights the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of suspected HIT in PCI patients, where it may mimic other post-procedural complications such as stent thrombosis. It underscores the critical need for vigilant monitoring of platelet counts, timely access to confirmatory diagnostic testing, immediate initiation of guideline-recommended non-heparin anticoagulants, and seamless communication during inter-hospital transfers to prevent potentially harmful interventions and improve patient outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Background Temporary transvenous pacing in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and significant tricuspid valve disease is technically challenging, especially in the absence of fluoroscopic guidance. Catheter looping and knot formation are rare but potentially hazardous complications. Case summary An 82-year-old woman with permanent atrial fibrillation and severe mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation presented with complete atrioventricular block and a ventricular escape rhythm at 28 bpm. A temporary transvenous pacing catheter inserted via the right internal jugular vein failed to achieve consistent ventricular capture and became entrapped at 45 cm, forming a knot near the venous introducer. Given the patient's frailty and high surgical risk, a multidisciplinary team opted for a fully percutaneous strategy for removal. After definitive pacemaker implantation, the knotted catheter was successfully retrieved using a stepwise approach: engagement of the loop with a deflectable ablation catheter, externalization through a femoral sheath, and extraction using a 13-F dilator sheath to minimize venous trauma. Discussion This case highlights procedural pitfalls during emergency temporary pacing without fluoroscopy and illustrates a safe, creative percutaneous solution for knot retrieval using tools familiar to electrophysiology and lead extraction operators.",

    "Abstract": "Background Hemodynamic assessment of coronary artery stenosis has impact on arterial graft patency. Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) obtains hemodynamic information of coronary artery stenosis. Methods Patients with history of isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (with ≥1 arterial graft) and at least one postoperative coronary re-assessment were retrospectively investigated. The preoperative angiography was used for retrospective QFR analysis of the native coronary target vessel, to which the arterial bypass graft was anastomosed. Analysis was performed by certified investigators, who were blinded towards postoperative arterial graft patency status. Coronary targets with QFR values of ≤0.80 were defined as hemodynamically relevant, whereas values of &amp;gt;0.80 were defined as hemodynamically irrelevant. Results Out of 5,692 patients, 596 patients had a postoperative coronary assessment and were therefore eligible for inclusion. In 196 arterial target vessels QFR analysis was possible. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed higher graft patency rates for arterial grafts anastomosed to coronary branches with QFR values ≤0.80 (log-rank: p = 0.017). In multivariable Cox regression analysis, QFR ≤ 0.80 remained an independent predictor for arterial graft patency (HR: 0.475, 95% CI: 0.261–0.867; p = 0.015), while visually estimated stenosis from preoperative coronary angiography did not ( p = 0.160). With an area under the curve of 0.595, 95% CI (0.503–0.688), the performance of the model was poor to at most moderate. Most target vessels [546 (80.22%)] were not analysable in retrospective fashion. Conclusion Though target vessel QFR ≤ 0.80 was associated with higher arterial graft patency, our trial observed low feasibility (high drop out rates) and poor diagnostic performance of QFR used in retrospective fashion. Caution is warranted for retrospective use of QFR in datasets with similar constraints.",

    "Abstract": "Aims This study aimed to identify the association of plaque burden and morphological features, such as burden, length, and composition, with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in populations with very high cardiovascular risk using coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). Methods and results A retrospective cohort study was performed in Lithuania among stable symptomatic patients who underwent coronary CTA. All plaques were manually inspected using plaque analysis software. The study included 772 patients. The mean age was 59.6 ± 9.9 years in men and 65.2 ± 8.7 years in women ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Women exhibited relatively greater proportions of densely calcified plaque volume, whereas men demonstrated significantly higher proportions of fibrous, fibrofatty, and necrotic core volumes (all p &amp;lt; 0.001). Across cardiovascular risk categories, plaque burden, length, total plaque volume, and plaque dense calcium volume increased progressively from the lowest to the highest risk group (all p &amp;lt; 0.001). Among plaque characteristics, after adjusting plaque parameters for age, gender, and cardiovascular risk factors in the multivariable regression analysis, all analysed plaque parameters remained significant predictors of all MACE, with plaque burden, fibrofatty and necrotic core volumes being among the strongest (OR 1.048, 95% CI 1.038–1.059, OR 1.072, 95% CI 1.031–1.115, OR 1.056, 95% CI 1.003–1.111, respectively). Additionally, all analysed plaque characteristics, except fibrous volume, remained significant predictors of non-elective MACE. Plaque burden showed the strongest discrimination for all MACE (AUC 0.68; cut-off ≥17.8%) and non-elective MACE (AUC 0.64; cut-off ≥18.3%), while other plaque characteristics demonstrated modest but statistically significant discrimination value. Conclusion This study reveals that plaque morphology provides independent prognostic information. Among the studied very high cardiovascular risk population, patients with non-calcified plaque features–especially those with higher fibrofatty and necrotic core volumes–were the strongest independent predictors of MACE, whereas plaque burden provided the highest discriminatory performance for MACE, suggesting it's complementary role in risk assessment.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate prediction of Quality of Service (QoS) plays a crucial role in service recommendation and selection across large-scale distributed environments. Latent factor (LF) models have become a mainstream solution for QoS prediction owing to their simplicity and scalability, yet typical formulations struggle to capture complex latent interactions and usually rely on manually tuned regularization, which often limits prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Core-Enhanced Latent Factor (ACELF) model that integrates a learnable core interaction mechanism with an incremental Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)-driven adaptive regularization strategy. Specifically, a learnable core interaction matrix is introduced to model interactions between latent user and service factors, enabling richer representation learning beyond standard bilinear assumptions. To further enhance robustness, we design an incremental PID controller that dynamically adjusts the regularization coefficient of the core interaction matrix according to the training dynamics, allowing the optimization process to automatically balance model expressiveness and overfitting. Extensive experiments on real-world QoS datasets demonstrate that ACELF consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.",

This open-label feasibility study examined whether participation in a home-based computerized cognitive training (CCT) program implemented via a commercial platform was associated with changes in sleep and related outcomes in adults from the general population reporting persistent sleep difficulties. Methods Thirty-two adults completed a four-week CCT intervention delivered via the CogniFit platform. The program consisted of 20 self-guided training sessions (∼45 min each), combining cognitive tasks targeting attention, memory, and executive functioning. Standardized self-report questionnaires and a computerized cognitive battery were administered immediately before and after the intervention to assess sleep quality, mood, cognition, and quality of life. Changes over time were examined using repeated-measures analyses, with Gender included as an exploratory between-subjects factor. Results Relative to baseline, post-intervention assessments showed statistically significant reductions in insomnia severity and sleep complaints, along with decreases in depressive symptoms and worry. Changes were also observed in executive functioning and global cognitive performance. No significant change was found in self-reported quality of life. Exploratory analyses indicated gender-related differences in depressive symptoms, worry, and executive functioning. Conclusions In this community sample, participation in a cognitively oriented computerized training program was associated with changes in sleep-related, emotional, and cognitive measures over time. Given the single-group feasibility design and modest sample size, these findings should be interpreted as preliminary and do not allow conclusions regarding clinical efficacy. Larger randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether such cognitively focused interventions provide benefits beyond non-specific effects and to clarify their role as adjuncts within multimodal approaches to insomnia.",

Various AI techniques, such as machine learning, deep learning, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are examined for their diagnostic potential and performance relative to traditional methods. The review also examines the integration of AI with radiographic imaging, intraoral scanners, and other diagnostic tools commonly used in pediatric dental practice. While AI presents considerable advantages such as speed, objectivity, and the potential to reduce human error, limitations, including data privacy, lack of standardized datasets, and ethical considerations, are also highlighted.

    "Abstract": "Objective This in vitro study evaluated the accuracy of 3D-printed surgical guides for the placement of temporary anchorage devices (TADs) in the mandibular buccal shelf. Methods Fifty CBCT scans from the Dubai Dental Hospital database were used to create 100 3D-printed mandibular models. A total of 100 TADs (BENEfit “R” screw, 11 mm length, 2 mm diameter) were inserted in the buccal shelf region between the first and second molars. Each mandible was duplicated to form two groups: (1) a guided group, where TADs were placed using a custom-designed surgical guide, and a (2) manual group, where placement was performed freehand. Results The guided group showed significantly higher TAD placement accuracy than the manual group, with improved parallelism to roots, closer proximity to the buccal cortical bone, greater distance from the lingual cortical bone and root apices, more upright angulation, and increased safety from the inferior alveolar nerve ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). Placement success was 98% vs. 70% for guided and manual groups, respectively ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Bone measurements showed greater width at the second molar and greater length at the first molar. Correlation analyses indicated that TAD angulation and proximity to cortical bone, root apices, and the inferior alveolar nerve were positively associated with local bone width, particularly at the second molar region ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion The use of 3D-printed surgical guides significantly enhanced the accuracy, safety, and clinical reliability of TAD placement in the mandibular buccal shelf, offering a valuable adjunct to orthodontic practice.",

    "Abstract": "Aims Interdental papilla loss produces unaesthetic “black triangles” that impair function and patient satisfaction. While surgical and non-surgical techniques exist, hyaluronic acid (HA) injections have emerged as a minimally invasive option, but their comparative effectiveness and certainty of evidence remain unclear. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of injectable HA for interdental papilla reconstruction. Materials and methods MEDLINE/PubMed and EMBASE were searched from inception through May 2025 for peer-reviewed randomized and non-randomized trials, cohort studies, or split-mouth designs in adults aged 18 years or older. Eligible studies compared injectable HA to surgical (e.g., connective tissue grafts) or non-surgical approaches (e.g., platelet-rich fibrin, saline placebo). The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2.0 and the ROBINS-I tool. Where appropriate, meta-analyses were performed, and heterogeneity was evaluated using the I 2 statistic. Results Three trials ( n = 39; 138 papillae) were included. Compared with saline, HA reduced the surface area of black triangles (SABT) (MD: −43.0 mm 2 ), increased papilla height (MD 0.22 mm), and improved patient satisfaction (MD: 17 VAS points). However, comparisons with active regenerative comparators showed no statistically significant differences. Quantitative synthesis was limited by very high heterogeneity ( I 2 up to 97%), small sample sizes, and methodological concerns; all included trials were judged to have some concerns regarding risk of bias. Discussion Hyaluronic acid offers short-term esthetic improvements over placebo, but evidence certainty is low to moderate, and no clear superiority over other regenerative approaches was demonstrated. Substantial heterogeneity and limited methodological robustness limit the confidence in quantitative conclusions. Conclusions Injectable HA may improve interdental papilla esthetics in the short term compared with placebo; however, its clinical advantage over other regenerative materials remains uncertain. Given the high heterogeneity, small sample sizes, and risk of bias, larger, well-designed randomized trials with standardized protocols and longer follow-up are required before firm clinical recommendations can be made.

    "Abstract": "The Castillon massif, in the northern Pyrenees, features a complex of decimetric to metric ultramafic and mafic layers emplaced within metasedimentary series (from the bottom to the top: garnet, sillimanite, and kyanite-bearing gneisses and sillimanite + cordierite-bearing gneisses). Ultramafic and mafic layers and metasediments have been deformed and metamorphosed under granulitic facies conditions during the Hercynian orogenesis. The mineralogical, petrologic, and geochemical characteristics of the studied samples allow us to define two distinct series: 1) a pyroxene-bearing magmatic series (UM-M1) consisting of ultramafic (UM: dunites, harzburgites, and orthopyroxenites) and mafic (M1: norites, gabbro–norites, and gabbros) rocks; and 2) a pyroxene-free and hornblende-bearing series (M2; mela-, meso-, and leucogabbros). The leucogabbros exhibit some characteristics of anorthosites, including the high Al 2 O 3 whole-rock content (31 wt%), high An content (An 84–96 ) in plagioclase, weak rare earth element enrichment, and very positive Eu anomalies. We propose that the rocks of the ultramafic and pyroxene-bearing rock-series (UM-M1 series) are all associated with the same magmatic event and that the M2 series rocks are associated with a distinct separate event. Isotopic data suggest that these formations are Ordovician. The M2 rocks have juvenile Nd isotopic signatures (εNd (460) from +4.59 to +8.11), suggesting that they are derived from superheated alumina-rich basaltic or basaltic–andesite melts extracted from a relatively depleted mantle source. In contrast, most of the M1 rocks derived from parental basaltic melts show partially crustal contamination, with only a few clearly juvenile samples (εNd (460) from +0.45 to +6.59). We propose a geodynamic evolution for the Castillon massif involving a two-stage genesis and the emplacement of the two series. First, the emplacement of olivine-saturated basaltic melts in a deep metasedimentary crust resulted in the M1 series. The second step involves the emplacement of alumina-rich basaltic or basaltic–andesite melts to produce the M2 hornblende-bearing series (mela-, meso-, and leucogabbros) devoid of pyroxenes. The leucogabbros show strong similarities with common anorthosites although they have not been previously observed in the Variscan Pyrenees.",

    "Abstract": "This study combines petrological, logging, and seismic analyses to investigate the development of favorable reservoirs within a source-to-sink framework. Here, we focus on the Upper Enping Formation of the Huizhou 26 Sag, located in the Huizhou Depression of the Pearl River Mouth Basin. In general, the study area can be divided into three segments, each controlled by different boundary faults. The source-to-sink analysis first reveals that five major source catchments, each with distinct drainage area and relief, developed within Mesozoic intrusive rocks, enabling a quantitative assessment of the sediment supply capacity for each catchment. Sediment transport systems are then evaluated based on the characteristics of boundary faults. Specifically, fault throw influences the preferred drainage pathways into the lake, while fault geometry and configuration regulate drainage convergence upon entry. When both source catchments and transport systems are optimal, braided river deltas form within the lake, as observed in the central and northern segments; otherwise, fan deltas prevail, as in the southern segment. In this source-to-sink context, the factors influencing high-quality reservoirs are further investigated. First, sedimentary facies exhibit first-order control on reservoir quality, with braided river delta plain facies having much better reservoir properties than fan delta facies. Secondly, enhanced transport in areas such as multi-stepped faults and paleo-uplifts can significantly improve reservoir quality. Finally, volcanic material infill can further modify reservoirs through various diagenetic processes. Taken together, this study demonstrates that braided river deltas within source-to-sink systems characterized by optimal catchment and transport conditions should serve as the primary targets for favorable reservoirs. In contrast, in areas dominated by fan deltas, only sandstones significantly influenced by processes such as enhanced transport and dissolution can develop into high-quality reservoirs. These insights contribute to advancing the exploration of the Enping Formation and guiding future exploration of the deeper strata in the southwestern Huizhou Depression.",

    "Abstract": "Freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) play an important role in the degradation of rock masses and the stability of slopes in cold, high-altitude regions. However, the degradation behaviour of basalt with different weathering degrees under freeze-thaw (F-T) conditions remains insufficiently understood. In this study, basalt samples collected from a bridge foundation slope in an alpine mountainous region were subjected to 100 FTCs in laboratory. The degradation was investigated through measuring the P-wave velocity, porosity, uniaxial compressive strength, and direct shear strength. Microstructural damage in basalt was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) at different freeze-thaw stages. The experimental results indicate that moderately weathered basalt exhibits more severe freeze-thaw-induced degradation than slightly weathered basalt. This difference is reflected in larger increases in porosity and greater reductions in P-wave velocity and mechanical strength. SEM observations show the microcracks propagation and structural degradation induced by FTCs. On the basis of the experimental results, an empirical model between strength degradation and easily measurable physical parameters was developed. The experimental evidence obtained in this work contributes to the understanding of freeze-thaw-induced degradation of basalt. It also offers practical support for engineering design and evaluation of rock slopes subjected to repeated freeze–thaw effects.",

    "Abstract": "Rapid and accurate mapping of landslides following triggering events such as intense rainfall is critical for emergency response, hazard assessment, and disaster mitigation, particularly in mountainous regions prone to frequent slope failures. The effectiveness of optical imagery in such contexts is often limited by persistent cloud cover and fog during the rainy season, whereas synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides all-weather, day-and-night observations, making it a suitable alternative for time-sensitive mapping. This study presents a deep learning framework incorporating a morphological optimization model for precise landslide detection from a single post-event polarimetric SAR acquisition. The morphological optimization model is introduced to impose shape- and connectivity-aware constraints on SAR-derived candidates, suppressing isolated false alarms and improving boundary continuity under speckle and terrain-induced noise. The approach combines polarimetric parameter selection, a Deep Forest classifier, a majority voting scheme, and shape constraints to enhance boundary delineation. A rainfall-induced landslide in Bijie City, Guizhou Province, China, was selected as the case study, using quad-polarization ALOS-2 and dual-polarization Sentinel-1 imagery. The observed performance gap between ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 is consistent with the stronger vegetation penetration and reduced volume-scattering sensitivity of L-band compared with C-band in humid mountainous terrain. The quad-pol ALOS-2 data achieved the highest overall accuracy (95.2%), followed by dual-pol ALOS-2 (89.8%), while Sentinel-1 provided effective regional-scale detection (76.3%). The results confirm the method’s potential for rapid, reliable landslide mapping in complex mountainous terrain, and its applicability to operational disaster assessment in regions with similar geomorphological and climatic conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly integrated into higher education to personalize instruction and support student engagement. However, the mediating role of teaching methods in this process remains underexplored. Methods This systematic review analyzed 73 peer-reviewed articles published between 2015 and early 2025, retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science, following PRISMA guidelines. Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion criteria and coded using a structured framework that examined AI types, engagement outcomes, and instructional strategies. Results Findings reveal that AI tools—such as chatbots, adaptive systems, and predictive analytics—enhance engagement most effectively when embedded within interactive pedagogies like flipped classrooms, project-based learning, and scaffolded feedback loops. To conceptualize this relationship, we introduce the PMAISE model (Pedagogical Mediation of AI for Student Engagement), which maps the alignment between AI technologies, pedagogical strategies, and the affective, behavioral, and cognitive dimensions of engagement. Concrete examples from recent studies demonstrate how teaching methods amplify or inhibit the effects of AI tools. The review also critically examines emerging concerns related to ethics, data privacy, and structural barriers to equitable AI adoption. Discussion This study offers a conceptual and practical framework for integrating AI into higher education in a context-sensitive, evidence-based, and pedagogically meaningful manner, highlighting the crucial role of thoughtful pedagogical mediation in maximizing AI’s educational benefits.",

    "Abstract": "The study investigates the effect of using mobile-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications on the development of English reading skills among primary students in Jordan. The researcher employed a quasi-experimental design. The sample consisted of 60 fifth-grade students selected using purposive sampling and assigned to two group: an experimental group of 30 students who received instruction through a mobile AI- application and a control group of 30 students who were taught using traditional methods. Traditional instruction relied on teacher explanation, textbook-based activities, and conventional drills, with students required to read aloud to the teacher, who monitored their progress. Students were also required to read the text aloud to the teacher, who monitored their progress during reading. The study was conducted at Independent International Schools during the 2024–2025 academic year. The study instrument consisted of an observation checklist. The results indicated statistically significant differences between the two groups, favoring the experimental group ( F (1,57) = 149.619, p &amp;lt; 0.001, η 2 = 0.710), which was attributed to the use of AI applications in teaching reading skills. The study recommended organizing training workshops for teachers to familiarize them with AI applications that support and enhance teaching, as well as adopting new strategies aligned with modern technological advancements to meet students’ needs and interests. These findings suggest that AI applications can enhance reading skills and highlight the importance of teacher training and further research on AI-assisted learning.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates how students use video lessons within a blended master’s degree program (LM-93), addressing a persistent research gap: most studies investigate perceived usefulness or self-reported engagement, whereas far fewer analyze trace-based behavioral data in authentic higher education contexts. Understanding real usage patterns is crucial, as pedagogical effectiveness depends not only on content quality but also on how students interact with video-based materials. While many studies focus on self-reported satisfaction or outcomes, fewer examine fine-grained behavioral data in authentic blended university contexts. Drawing on evidence-based research on educational innovation, we analyzed 5,278 viewing sessions tracked through the Panopto platform across 14 courses over two academic years. A multi-step quantitative approach was applied, combining descriptive statistics, correlations, manual segmentation, and K-means clustering (Jain, 2010). Results show substantial heterogeneity in viewing behaviors: for example, only 18% of sessions fall into an “in-depth” profile, characterized by long viewing time, high completion, and frequent interactions. Four stable behavioral profiles emerged (in-depth, fast, partial, and discontinuous) highlighting diverse strategies in time management and engagement. These findings suggest that asynchronous video lessons can support engagement and self-regulation for a subset of students, but also risk reinforcing superficial or fragmented use for others. The study offers actionable implications for instructional design and inclusivity in blended learning: designing shorter and more navigable video lessons, integrating checkpoints and formative feedback, and using Learning Analytics dashboards to support data-informed and Universal Design for Learning–oriented practices. Limitations include the single-institution context, reliance on platform logs, and the absence of qualitative triangulation, which point to future research integrating behavioral, outcome, and qualitative data. The study also highlights the need for transparent and ethically informed uses of Learning Analytics when interpreting behavioral traces.",

    "Abstract": "This study focuses on the evaluation of vocational school teachers’ professional competencies. By addressing current limitations such as narrow evaluation dimensions and single-subject assessment, it integrates diverse theoretical frameworks and policies—including teacher efficacy theory—to construct an evaluation system. Through qualitative interviews and the Delphi method, the system comprises 7 primary indicators, 25 secondary indicators, and 89 tertiary indicators. These encompass: Professional awareness and ethics, Foundational competencies, Theoretical instruction, Practical teaching, Program development, Educational Research and Reform, and Professional development capabilities. A multi-subject collaborative evaluation model was established by integrating subjective and objective weighting methods using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and entropy method, and its empirical application was conducted at a vocational school in Hubei Province. Research findings indicate significant disparities in teachers’ professional competencies, with higher scores in the dimension of professional ethics, while competencies in teaching research, practical teaching, and other areas remain relatively weak. Regression analysis reveals that factors such as years of teaching experience and corporate training programs exert differential impacts on competency development. Finally, we propose countermeasures such as tiered training, school-enterprise collaboration, and institutional optimization to provide practical references and support for evaluating vocational school teachers’ competencies and advancing their professional development.",

    "Abstract": "Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are a class of amino acids characterized by a branched aliphatic side chain, and they play critical physiological roles in humans, including protein synthesis, metabolic regulation, and immune system maintenance. Beyond serving as fundamental building blocks for protein biosynthesis, BCAAs and their metabolites also function as signaling molecules that regulate a variety of physiological processes, notably insulin secretion. Accumulating evidence indicates that plasma BCAAs levels are markedly elevated in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), a phenomenon that may result from impaired activity of key enzymes in the BCAAs catabolic pathway, leading to metabolic dysregulation. It is widely recognized that BCAAs can activate the mTOR signaling cascade, thereby affecting insulin receptor sensitivity. In addition, aberrant BCAAs metabolism has been closely linked to alterations in the gut microbiota, which may further aggravate insulin resistance (IR). Taken together, dysregulated BCAAs metabolism may represent a critical mechanism underlying IR in T2DM. Therefore, this review summarizes current knowledge on BCAAs metabolism, explores its potential roles in the pathogenesis of IR in T2DM, and highlights emerging therapeutic strategies to reduce IR by targeting BCAAs metabolism.",

This study aims to monitor protein expression changes in ESRD patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods A total of 186 ESRD patients who underwent arteriovenous fistula creation surgery were enrolled in this study. Of these, 148 patients were classified into the T2DM (n = 73) and non-T2DM (n = 75) groups. Data-independent acquisition proteomic analysis was conducted to analyze differentially expressed proteins. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits, immunohistochemical staining, Western blotting were employed to validate the differently expressed proteins within the cohort. Results Proteomic analysis identified 26 upregulated and 15 downregulated proteins in the T2DM group compared with the non-T2DM group. The serum concentrations of 4-hydroxynonenal, malondialdehyde, and glutathione were elevated in the T2DM group. The immunohistochemical staining index for GPX4 and xCT was lower, while α-SMA, IL-6, TNF-α, and TGF-β levels were higher in the T2DM group compared with the non-T2DM group.

    "Abstract": "Background Thyroid hormones play an important role in the growth and development of the kidneys. However, there are few reports focusing on the correlation between thyroid hormones and diabetic kidney disease (DKD). The purpose of this study was to explore the association between thyroid hormone levels and DKD in euthyroid patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM). Methods We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study among hospitalized T2DM patients, and a total of 559 patients were enrolled in this study. The patients were divided into two groups: 136 in the DKD group and 423 in the non-DKD group. All patients received continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and glucose variability indices were recorded, including the standard deviation of glucose levels (SD), coefficient of variation of glucose (CV), mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE), and mean of daily differences in glucose (MODD). Univariate ANOVA, Pearson/Spearman correlation analysis, and multivariate logistic regression analysis were employed to investigate the relationship between thyroid hormones, glucose variability, and DKD. Results The DKD group exhibited lower free triiodothyronine (FT3) levels compared to the non-DKD group. In patients with type 2 diabetes, glycemic variability indicators (SD, CV, MODD) showed a significant decreasing trend across FT3 tertiles. Furthermore, FT3 was negatively correlated with SD, CV, and MODD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that FT3 and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) were related to the presence of DKD. Conclusions In euthyroid patients with T2DM, thyroid hormone levels influence glycemic variability. Lower levels of FT3 within the normal range are associated with greater glycemic fluctuations. Additionally, in these patients, FT3 and TSH levels are correlated with the occurrence of DKD. Reduced FT3 levels and elevated TSH levels worked as risk factors for the prevalence of DKD.",

Seizures occurred in 79.2%, while vitamin D deficiency (67.1%) and hypoparathyroidism (28.0%) were the leading causes of severe hypocalcemia. The mean ionized calcium level was profoundly low (0.66 ± 0.13 mmol/L). Patients with vitamin D deficiency had markedly low 25(OH)D levels (mean 18.4 nmol/L) and high PTH (mean 261.7 pg/mL), consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism. Conversely, those with hypoparathyroidism showed low PTH levels (22.2 pg/mL) despite significant hypocalcemia. Children with DiGeorge syndrome had even lower PTH levels (6.3 pg/mL) and preserved phosphate. In multivariate analyses, lower ionized calcium and lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were independent predictors of seizures. Cardiac complications (cardiogenic shock and/or acute heart failure) occurred in 5.7% and were associated with more severe hypocalcemia. Conclusion Severe pediatric hypocalcemia in Vietnam predominantly affects infants and young children and is largely attributable to preventable vitamin D deficiency. While vitamin D deficiency is globally recognized, this study provides novel region-specific insight into the high frequency of symptomatic presentations, including seizures and cardiac events, in a tropical setting with presumed adequate sunlight exposure. It also emphasizes distinct biochemical phenotypes that allow early etiological stratification. These findings reinforce the urgency of proactive vitamin D supplementation policies and biochemical screening protocols tailored for high-risk populations, particularly in resource-limited settings.",

    "Abstract": "Objective Autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT), a prevalent autoimmune disorder that frequently leads to hypothyroidism. A critical unmet need exists for disease-modifying therapies that target its underlying pathogenesis. This study aimed to identify and validate novel therapeutic targets for AIT. Methods We employed an integrative genomics approach, combining genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses, including expression (eQTL), protein (pQTL), and DNA methylation QTL (mQTL), across two independent AIT cohorts for discovery and replication. We performed two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) with sensitivity analyses, followed by summary-data-based MR (SMR) and heterogeneity in dependent instruments (HEIDI) tests. Top candidates were further evaluated via phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) and computational drug screening. Guided by these findings, we quantified plasma levels of the top-priority candidate, Ribonuclease T2 (RNASET2), via ELISA in AIT patients and non-AIT controls. To functionally validate its therapeutic potential, we developed a novel three-dimension (3D) inflammatory thyrocyte spheroid model and evaluated potential therapeutic effects of recombinant RNASET2. Loss-of-function (small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown) and gain-of-function (recombinant protein RNASET2 rescue) experiments further supported RNASET2 as a therapeutic target. Results Multi-omics integration consistently nominated RNASET2 as a causal protective factor against AIT. Signals of pQTL and eQTL for RNASET2 were associated with decreased AIT risk, while three mQTLs were correlated with increased risk. PheWAS indicated minimal pleiotropic effects, supporting its therapeutic suitability. Computational drug screening nominated genistein, a soy isoflavone known to upregulate RNASET2 expression, as a repurposing candidate. Empirically, plasma RNASET2 levels were moderately elevated in AIT patients, potentially reflecting a compensatory anti-inflammatory response. Crucially, recombinant RNASET2 effectively mitigated inflammation and apoptosis in the thyrocyte spheroid model, confirming its functional protective role. Consistently, RNASET2 knockdown heightened susceptibility to inflammatory cell death and cytokine expression, a phenotype reversed by recombinant RNASET2 supplementation. Conclusions By integrating large-scale genomic analyses with functional validation, our study establishes RNASET2 as a promising therapeutic target for AIT. RNASET2 augmentation represents a potential disease-modifying strategy, providing a translational bridge from genetic discovery to clinical application.",

    "Abstract": "Background Cushing’s disease (CD) is characterized by chronic hypercortisolism and is associated with persistent metabolic, psychological, and neurocognitive disturbances. While metabolic consequences are well described, the impact of disease activity and remission on eating behavior remains insufficiently explored. Objective This study aimed to compare multidimensional eating behavior patterns among patients with active Cushing’s disease, patients in biochemical remission, and healthy controls, and to examine their associations with cortisol biomarkers. Methods In this cross-sectional study, 74 participants were enrolled, including patients with active CD (n = 21), patients in remission (n = 32), and age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy controls (n = 21). Eating behavior was assessed using validated questionnaires: the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Emotional Appetite Questionnaire (EMAQ), Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire–Revised 18 (TFEQ-R18), Mindful Eating Questionnaire (MEQ), and Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ). Group differences were analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis tests followed by Dunn’s post-hoc comparisons with Bonferroni correction. Associations between eating behavior scores and cortisol parameters were evaluated using Spearman correlation analysis. Results Active Cushing’s disease was associated with higher night eating (NEQ; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and greater emotional and situational eating compared with remission and healthy controls (EMAQ total; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Positive emotion and situation subscales were higher in active disease (both p = 0.008), whereas negative total scores differed significantly only between active disease and healthy controls (p = 0.014). Mindful eating was reduced in both patient groups versus controls (MEQ total; p &amp;lt; 0.001), with active disease showing higher disinhibition (p = 0.002), greater interference (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and lower conscious nutrition (p = 0.016). Remission patients demonstrated partial but incomplete behavioral recovery. Late-night salivary cortisol correlated with MEQ interference (r = 0.5, p = 0.01), and cortisol levels after the 1-mg DST correlated with DEBQ emotional eating (r = 0.5, p = 0.01). Conclusion Cushing’s disease is associated with marked alterations in eating behavior, particularly during active disease, including increased night eating, emotional susceptibility, and reduced mindful regulation. Although partial improvement occurs after remission, residual behavioral disturbances persist. These findings underscore the importance of integrating behavioral assessment into the long-term management of Cushing’s disease.",

    "Abstract": "Objective Ovarian aging is an inevitable age-associated biological phenomenon.Enhancing clinical pregnancy outcomes in women with advanced maternal age (AMA) has emerged as a critical research priority in reproductive medicine. The current study seeks to unravel the mechanism governing mitochondrial energy metabolism reprogramming in granulosa cells (GCs) during age-associated ovarian aging. Methods We conducted an age-stratified prospective observational study involving GC samples from 10 young infertile women (young group: 21–34 years) and 10 infertile women with AMA (AMA group: 35–42 years), all undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET). Participants were recruited from November 2023 to November 2024. Additionally, an in vitro oxidative stress-induced senescence model was established using hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 )-treated human ovarian granulosa-like tumor cell line (KGN cells) to further investigate metabolic disturbances and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) levels in senescent GCs. Results High-resolution targeted metabolomics revealed 25 statistically significant metabolite alterations in ovarian GCs, indicating profound dysregulation of core energy metabolism pathways—particularly oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), glycolysis, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Compared to the young group, the AMA group exhibited upregulated glycolytic metabolites alongside downregulated OXPHOS and TCA cycle intermediates. These findings were further validated in an H 2 O 2 -induced KGN cells senescence model, where treated cells demonstrated: (1) increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity, (2) elevated extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and lactate (Lac) production, (3) reduced oxygen consumption rate (OCR), (4) depleted glucose and pyruvate(Pyr) pools, and (5) heightened mtROS generation relative to control group. Conclusions Collectively, our research demonstrates that GCs undergo mitochondrial energy metabolism reprogramming, characterized by a metabolic shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis, during ovarian aging. These observations suggest that age-associated glycometabolic perturbations may represent a novel therapeutic target for infertility in women with AMA.",

Epidemiological data show a significant increase in the prevalence of HT, which is about four times more common in adult women than in men. The pathogenesis of HT involves a complex interaction of genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, and immune regulation. Its clinical diagnosis is mainly based on serological tests (TPOAb/TGAb) and thyroid ultrasound features. The current treatment of Hashimoto’s is based on levothyroxine (T4) replacement. This article presents a narrative review of the pathogenesis, status, and challenges of treatment of HT to provide a theoretical basis for optimizing clinical practice and basic research.",

Methods A case-control study was conducted involving 54 MASLD patients alongside 54 healthy controls who were matched for age, gender, and ethnicity. Participants underwent comprehensive blood biochemical testing, including liver function, kidney function, glucose, lipid, XOR activity, markers of oxidative stress, and inflammatory factors. Non-targeted metabolomics detection was conducted to identify alterations in the metabolites of MASLD patients. Results MASLD patients showed significantly elevated levels of XOR activity, and this increase was positively correlated with significantly altered markers of oxidative stress and inflammatory factors, including increased malondialdehyde levels, tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-6. Metabolomic analysis revealed a unique pattern of specific metabolites, including animo acids, sphingolipids, phospholipids, and fatty acids, which were significantly altered in MASLD. A total of 100 metabolites were identified as differentially expressed between MASLD and control groups, with 44 metabolites specifically associated with XOR activity. These metabolites were significantly correlated with lipid profiles, oxidative stress indices, and inflammatory factors.

    "Abstract": "Background The corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test is used to diagnose adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency; however, the serum cortisol cutoff value indicating impaired response on this test (18 µg/dL [approximately 500 nmol/L]) was established from the insulin tolerance test. We aimed to define a serum cortisol cutoff after CRH stimulation to diagnose ACTH deficiency. Methods Patients who underwent CRH stimulation at Nagoya University Hospital from 2016 to 2022 were divided retrospectively into two groups based on the need for hydrocortisone replacement at final follow-up (discovery cohort). Plasma ACTH and serum cortisol levels were measured at baseline and 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes post-CRH administration using a current monoclonal antibody-based cortisol assay. The optimal cortisol cutoffs at each time point were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. These cutoffs were validated using a nationwide disease registry in Japan (validation cohort). Results In the discovery cohort (n = 227), cortisol levels were significantly higher in patients who did not receive hydrocortisone therapy (n = 136) than in those who did (n = 91) at all time points (p &amp;lt; 0.001). ROC analysis revealed that a 30-minute post-CRH cortisol level of 12.6 µg/dL (347.6 nmol/L) provided the best diagnostic performance to identify patients not requiring hydrocortisone therapy (sensitivity: 88.2%; specificity: 92.3%; AUC: 0.969). In the validation cohort (n = 52), this cutoff was confirmed as optimal (sensitivity: 81.0%; specificity: 86.4%; accuracy: 83.7%). Conclusion A 30-minute post-CRH serum cortisol level of 12.6 µg/dL is a useful cutoff for diagnosing ACTH deficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Background The temporal dynamics of sleep disturbances following radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), along with their underlying mechanisms and associated factors, remain poorly understood. This gap underscores the need for longitudinal investigations. Methods We conducted a longitudinal study of 160 DTC patients from Guangdong Southern Teaching Hospital. Self-assessment scales were used to assess patients’ knowledge of the purpose of ¹³¹I therapy, depression, anxiety symptom and sleep assessment scales were used to assess with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index, Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). Assessments were conducted at three time points: pre-therapy, peri-therapy (during hospitalization), and post-therapy. Results Of the 160 patients, 148 completed the study (53 males [35.8%]; 95 females [64.2%]). Risk factors associated with sleep disorders included anxiety, snoring, educational level, and work/study-related stress. Longitudinal trajectory analysis revealed nonlinear trends: the incidence of sleep disorders (35.8% → 52.9% → 32.6%), anxiety symptoms (23.6% → 40.7% → 14.0%), and depressive symptoms (47.3% → 56.4% → 33.3%) all increased initially before declining. Conclusion With increasing treatment duration, the incidence of sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression initially rose and subsequently declined. Sleep quality reached its lowest point at the end of treatment, whereas anxiety and depression levels peaked one month post-therapy before decreasing to levels below the pre-treatment baseline.",

Inflammation-related proteins were analyzed with differential expression through linear mixed modeling. Results Compared to normal tissue, inflammatory cell surface protein markers were increased in DKD tubules and interstitium. Markers of T cells (CD4, CD44), macrophages (CD68; proinflammatory), and antigen-presenting cells (APCs; CD40 and CD11c) were increased across all DKD compartments (vs. normal). Macrophage (CD163; prorepair) marker was increased in DKD tubules and interstitium (vs. normal). Fewer differences were observed in glomeruli for normal vs. DKD or TIN vs. DKD groups. CD66b+ (granulocytes) cell marker was higher in DKD (vs. TIN). As expected, TIN had higher levels of T cell and macrophage markers in tubules and interstitium (vs. DKD). Interestingly, CD34, a hematopoietic stem cell and endothelial cell marker, was lower in DKD tubules and interstitium (vs. normal) but higher in DKD (vs. TIN). Conclusion NanoString GeoMx DSP technology may fulfil a role in enhancing the understanding the inflammatory landscape engaged in DKD pathogenesis as well as measuring response to therapy. Moreover, additional investigations of CD34 progenitor cell depletion in DKD may be warranted.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Kidney stones are a common disorder with increasing global prevalence. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a systemic metabolic condition, has been suggested to be linked with kidney stones, but existing evidence is inconsistent. This study aimed to clarify the association between MASLD and kidney stones risk using both cross-sectional and cohort analyses. Methods A total of 1,875 participants from a cross-sectional study and 1,903 from a community-based cohort were analyzed. Logistic regression was used in the cross-sectional study, while incidence rates, Kaplan–Meier curves, log-rank tests, and Cox models estimated risk in the cohort. Subgroup and mediation analyses were performed, with METS-IR, WBC, and eGFR examined as mediators. Results In the cohort study, there were 94 incident kidney stone cases identified during a median follow-up of 34.62 months, with an incidence rate of 17.6 per 1,000 person-years. In the cross-sectional analysis, MASLD was positively associated with kidney stones, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.466 (95% CI: 1.059–2.028) after adjustment for potential confounders. Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed significant differences in cumulative incidence between MASLD and non-MASLD groups (log-rank P &amp;lt; 0.001). Cox regression confirmed MASLD as an independent risk factor for kidney stones (HR = 2.04, 95% CI: 1.29–3.23). Subgroup analyses showed consistent associations in metabolically high-risk individuals. Mediation analyses further highlighted METS-IR as a key mediator linking MASLD to kidney stone formation. Conclusions MASLD was independently associated with increased kidney stone risk, particularly in metabolically high-risk individuals. METS-IR mediated this relationship, underscoring the critical role of insulin resistance.",

    "Abstract": "The aim of this article is to examine how energy management systems (EMSs) in smart microgrids (MGs) can be achieved with the increased use of renewable energy, energy storage systems (ESSs), and time-of-use tariffs, which introduce variability and uncertainty in the market, supply, and demand. As a result, operators will be able to decrease operation costs and pollutant emissions while improving the flexibility of energy in various conditions. In this regard, the mathematical model for an EMS is first developed, which considers the real-time energy pricing, wind turbines (WTs), photovoltaics (PVs), fuel cells, microturbines, and ESSs, as well as the energy sold to the grid by the smart MG. Second, a stochastic optimization framework was examined that accounts for system uncertainty using the reduced unscented transformation layout. In addition, by applying the penalty function approach, the balance between generation and consumption, as well as grid limitations, is taken into account. To address the system’s uncertainties, the stochastic optimization was used to model load demand, PVs, WTs, and market price uncertainties. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework, the suggested energy management is considered under different case studies, such as with and without ESS, and limitations on exchanged power with the grid. Different optimization algorithms, such as grey wolf optimizer (GWO), improved GWO (IGWO), whale optimization algorithm, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and improved PSO (IPSO), are applied to solve the suggested stochastic multi-objective optimization problem by using the weighting factor ratios. To solve a stochastic multi-objective problem with grid limitations and an ESS, IGWO achieves the best rank in finding the best solution of 2,366.88 with a low standard deviation of 72.43. In contrast, the best solutions of GWO, WOA, PSO, and IPSO are 2,676.76, 2,818.56, 2,640.87, and 2,439.42, respectively, with standard deviations of 15,083.78, 146,046.86, 4,352.86, and 403.57. The total cost and emission of the best solution of the stochastic optimization problem for IGWO are 893.93 cents/kWh and 736.48 kg/MWh, respectively. This shows that the IGWO clearly outperforms GWO, WOA, PSO, and IPSO. In addition, as shown in simulation results, this model reduces energy prices and environmental pollution, optimizes the MG operations, and demonstrates the effectiveness of IGWO. In addition, different weighting factor ratios are considered to assess the sensitivity of the results to the weighting factor ratios.",

    "Abstract": "The operation of fuel cell electric vehicle-to-grid (FCEV2G) stations presents a significant challenge due to the need to manage onsite hydrogen production, storage, and vehicle dispatch in volatile electricity markets. While mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) can determine the theoretically optimal, perfect-foresight strategy, its high computational cost makes it unsuitable for real-time deployment. This study proposes and validates a machine learning (ML) framework to create a rapid and effective operational controller. We first developed a sophisticated MILP expert, enhanced with a rolling horizon and a lookahead mechanism, to generate a dataset of optimal decisions using historical Alberta market data. Subsequently, an agent with deep neural network policy was trained using behavioral cloning to mimic this expert. The agent’s architecture was designed with a 48-dimensional observation space, critically incorporating multi-horizon price forecasts to enable strategic foresight. The trained behavioral cloning agent demonstrated exceptional performance, capturing 93.2% of the expert’s maximum possible profit on the in-sample training data and a robust 80.4% on an out-of-sample test set, confirming its ability to generalize. Further analysis revealed that the agent successfully learned a smart but cautious operational strategy, characterized by a conservative inventory policy and forecast-driven patience. In conclusion, this research delivers a successful proof-of-concept for an intelligent FCEV2G operational controller. The primary contribution is the validation of a method to replace the complex, long-term strategy of a slow optimizer with a fast, near-optimal ML policy capable of making decisions in milliseconds. This work demonstrates a viable pathway for deploying data-driven, real-time operation systems for complex energy assets.",

    "Abstract": "Long-term monitoring is a crucial asset for informed decision-making in viable ecosystem management. Conservation initiatives involving local stakeholders are receiving increasing support; however, in remote regions such as the Western Amazon, scientific data are often scarce, and conservation efforts rarely integrate Indigenous knowledge into decision-making. To address this gap, this study aims to promote Citizen Science as a bridge between Indigenous communities, their ecological knowledge, and scientific data, thereby advancing environmental management and freshwater ecosystems conservation to the next level. Our case study focuses on the Curaray-Nushiño fluvial system in the Ecuadorian Amazon, home to the ancestral Waorani Indigenous Nationality. This area constitutes a biodiversity hotspot, where communities have relied on the integrity of the fluvial system that supports their livelihoods, which is threatened by anthropogenic pressures. Through the Citizen Science Project of the Alianza Aguas Amazonicas, Waorani monitors collected data, analyzed indicators of water quality, and documented the presence and abundance of edible fish. Data was co-produced through participatory field protocols, integrating community knowledge and scientific methods to inform about the ecological status of streams. Overall, results revealed that local monitors can successfully generate reliable datasets on water quality and fish diversity. This initiative highlights the potential of empowering Indigenous-led participatory freshwater conservation, reinforcing the role of local knowledge in generating and using data to preserve their territories.",

    "Abstract": "On 1 August 2021, a vigorous hailstorm hit Azzano Decimo, in northeastern Italy. The supercell storm produced hailstones up to 10 cm in maximum dimension, which is quite unusual in this area. The storm’s environment registered one of the largest potential instabilities ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"m1\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo> <mml:mn>3400</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> J <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"m2\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:msup> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">k</mml:mi> <mml:mi mathvariant=\"normal\">g</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>−</mml:mo> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:msup> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> ) ever observed by the local operational Udine radiosonde site. In this paper, we analyze the mesoscale environment supporting the hailstorm. Observations from the nearby operational Fossalon di Grado dual-polarization radar showed the presence of a pronounced Bounded Weak Echo Region and differential reflectivity column, both proxies for intense updrafts; however, Doppler velocities revealed only weaker winds, with the mesocyclone mostly confined to midlevels. Two independent observers in Azzano Decimo collected nine hailstones, including one with a maximum dimension of 9 cm. The physical structure of these hailstones was analyzed in the National Center for Atmospheric Research cold room, including normal and cross-polarized light photographs of thin sections to identify the different growth layers inside each hailstone. Additionally, ice samples were taken from 1 cm <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"m3\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>×</mml:mo> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> cm <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"m4\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>×</mml:mo> <mml:mspace width=\"0.3333em\"/> <mml:mn>1</mml:mn> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> mm pieces from these thin slices. The stable isotopic ratio analyses were performed on these specimens using a Picarro cavity ring-down spectrometer. Isotopic content of the hailstone layers revealed significant variability, including some internal layers that showed signs of kinetic fractionation owing to evaporating liquid being incorporated into the growth layer, likely from evaporation of surface liquid during wet growth or collection of recirculated raindrops that experienced evaporation prior to participating in hail growth. Despite such large isotope variability, the Jouzel model analysis suggested that the major growth happened at high altitudes (between 8 and 10 km), which is also in agreement with a reversible-adiabatic parcel model and radar observations from the event.",

    "Abstract": "Black carbon (BC) is produced by the incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels. After deposition in soils, BC forms a relatively stable carbon pool that contributes to long-term carbon sequestration. Understand the effects of land use on soil BC is critical for accurately interpreting the role of BC in the carbon cycle of karst areas. This study investigated the distribution characteristics of organic carbon (OC), BC, char, soot, and soil physicochemical properties within the 0–40 cm soil profiles of secondary forest, shrub, farmland, and wasteland in a rocky desertification area of Guangxi Province, a typical karst region in Southwest China. A combination of soot/char separation and δ 13 C BC isotope analysis was used to identify the sources of BC in these soils. The result show that average soil BC content was highest in secondary forests (7.20 g/kg), followed by shrub (5.85 g/kg), farmland (3.64 g/kg), and wasteland (3.38 g/kg). BC showed a positive correlation with OC, char, soot, soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and a negative correlation with bulk density. Among BC components, char accounted for a greater proportion than soot, and the heavy fraction of OC exhibited a higher BC concentration than the light fraction. Overall, the BC content was primarily derived from C 3 plant combustion, vehicle exhaust emissions, and fossil fuel use in agricultural production activities. Vegetation restoration improved soil BC levels and promoted OC sequestration, while thereby enhancing soil carbon stability.",

    "Abstract": "This study starts from the understanding that green finance is a central pillar of the green transition in the European Union, in which green finance is not just a financial instrument, but the mechanism through which both public capital (government or European funds) and private capital (banks, investors, companies) are directed towards projects that support environmental and sustainability objectives. The proposed research assesses which EU Member States perform best in the field of green finance and identifies the structural factors underlying these differences, using a composite index based on the entropy method. The index integrates eight indicators that capture financial effort and environmental outcomes, specifically green investments as a share of GDP, renewable energy share, environmental taxes, greenhouse gas intensity of the economy, Environmental Performance Index, green transport, protected areas, and waste generated per capita . Official international data sources, including Eurostat, the European Environment Agency, the World Bank, and Yale University, were utilized for all variables in 2023. All indicators were normalized, and weights were assigned objectively using the entropy method to ensure comparability and reduce subjective bias. The results show wide disparities across the European Union. Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Lithuania form the leading group due to high levels of green investment, strong renewable energy profiles, and low greenhouse gas intensity. Large industrial economies such as Germany and Italy score lower because their high emission levels outweigh the effect of existing environmental measures. Smaller and service-oriented economies, such as Luxembourg and Malta, perform relatively well due to their moderate emissions and balanced environmental outcomes. At the opposite end, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Czechia record the weakest results, shaped by carbon-intensive economic structures and limited green investment. These findings suggest that the interaction between financial commitment and structural characteristics, such as the energy mix and emission intensity, strongly influences performance in green finance. Strengthening green investment flows and accelerating emission reduction efforts remain essential for convergence across the EU. Tailoring national green finance strategies to each country’s structural profile can increase the effectiveness of financial instruments and support progress towards the objectives of the European Green Deal.",

    "Abstract": "Against the backdrop of increasing extreme weather events (EWEs) due to global climate change, and given the limited research on their impact on aquatic ecosystems, this study investigated the effects of floods and blizzards on periphytic algal communities in seven water bodies in the Shennongjia Forestry District, China. We hypothesized that EWEs would reduce periphytic algal diversity, weaken community stability. Results revealed that EWEs significantly decreased periphytic algal biomass (by 92.9% ± 2.9%), richness (1.3% ± 0.2%), evenness (21.5% ± 4.0%), and Shannon diversity (7.0% ± 1.4%) (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Additionally, these events destabilized the co-occurrence networks by reducing node connectivity, centrality, and complexity, resulting in structural simplification that diminished the system’s ability to withstand disturbances. Floods specifically increased water velocity (58.1%) and created shading, leading to a decline in algal diversity. In contrast, blizzards drastically reduced water temperature (69.5%), posing severe survival challenges to the algal communities. It was concluded that EWEs reduced community’s diversity by altering habitat heterogeneity and weakened network stability through changing in species’ adaptation and community shifts. Water temperature and velocity were identified as key drivers of community composition changes during EWEs. This research provided insights into the mechanisms of climate change affecting periphytic algal communities.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Immune reconstitution is a critical parameter in successful hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and involves different cell types and a microenvironment including cytokines. Natural killer (NK) cells and γδ T cells are known to repopulate early after HCT and are proposed to have the intriguing capacity of mediating graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects without accompanying graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Interleukin-15 (IL-15) and interleukin-7 (IL-7) are key homeostatic cytokines, with effects on both T and NK cells, making these cytokines especially interesting in an HCT setting. Methods In this prospective study, we investigated associations between IL-15 and IL-7, NK cells and γδ T cells, including activated subtypes, and clinical outcomes. We included 105 patients undergoing allogeneic HCT at a single-center institution. IL-15, IL-7, and extended T and NK cell phenotyping were measured longitudinally at fixed time points following HCT. Results We found high IL-15 concentrations early post-transplant to be significantly associated with reduced overall survival, reduced relapse-free survival, and excess acute GVHD. Furthermore, IL-15 showed significant inverse correlations with NK cells and γδ T cells, including activated subtypes early after HCT, and with conventional T cells at later time points. IL-7 was significantly inversely correlated not only with conventional T cells but also with γδ T cells early after HCT. Discussion These findings may suggest that early immune reconstitution of NK cells and γδ T cells is influenced by the bioavailability of IL-15 after HCT and that IL-15 could have a mechanistic effect in the activity of these innate effector cells. NK cells and γδ T cells are currently being investigated in several promising treatment settings, and IL-15 here may offer a potential benefit.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study aimed to elucidate the mechanistic role of M2 tumor-associated macrophages in esophageal cancer (EC) progression and to construct an M2 macrophage–related gene signature for prognostic prediction. Methods Integrated analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq data of EC were performed. scRNA-seq data were processed with Seurat and annotated using SingleR. Immune infiltration was evaluated through ssGSEA and CIBERSORT. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify M2 macrophage–associated modules, and candidate genes were intersected with differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional enrichment analyses were performed, and a prognostic risk model was established through multivariate Cox regression analysis. The functional roles of key genes were validated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Results Twelve cell types were identified by scRNA-seq, with macrophages representing the predominant immune population. M2 macrophages formed the major immunosuppressive subtype and were negatively associated with patient survival. WGCNA and DEG analysis identified 25 M2-related genes, from which a four-gene prognostic signature ( SPINK5 , A2ML1 , IL1RN , IL36G ) was constructed. The model effectively stratified EC patients into distinct risk groups with significantly different survival outcomes. Further in vitro experiments demonstrated that silencing IL1RN and IL36G in macrophages markedly suppressed the malignant phenotypes of esophageal cancer cells. Complementary in vivo experiments provided additional evidence, further indicating that IL1RN and IL36G play important functional roles in overall tumor progression. Conclusion A four-gene M2 macrophage–related prognostic model provides reliable prediction of clinical outcomes in EC. Among these genes, IL1RN and IL36G function as key regulators whose silencing inhibits M2 polarization and attenuates tumor proliferation, invasion, migration, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition.",

    "Abstract": "In pediatric Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ B-ALL), the clinical value of highly sensitive minimal residual disease (MRD) detection by immunoglobulin next-generation sequencing (Ig-NGS), and its role for tracking clonal evolution, remains inadequately characterized. In this study, we evaluated MRD in a cohort of pediatric Ph+ B-ALL patients using Ig-NGS in parallel with conventional methods, including flow cytometry (FCM) and BCR-ABL reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Malignant clonal burden at diagnosis, MRD kinetics, and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) clonal evolution were analyzed for their prognostic relevance. We observed that a lower percentage of malignant clonal cells detected by Ig-NGS at diagnosis was associated with improved relapse-free survival (RFS) (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Ig-NGS-derived pre-treatment malignant clone burden showed stronger association with relapse risk compared with FCM or RT-PCR. Furthermore, Ig-NGS MRD negativity at the end of induction (EOI) was associated with superior two-yeas RFS (p = 0.01), and Ig-NGS detected molecular relapse earlier than FCM or RT-PCR in some patients. Specific IGHV and IGHJ gene usage patterns and the extent of V-replacement clonal evolution at diagnosis were also correlated with prognosis. In summary, these findings suggested that Ig-NGS based MRD assessment may provide enhanced prognostic stratification and enable dynamic monitoring of clonal evolution in pediatric Ph+ B-ALL. Its integration into routine clinical practice may enhance early relapse prediction and support more precise risk-adapted therapeutic decisions.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Abscopal effects (AbE) during combined radiotherapy (RT) and immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) represent a potential mechanism for systemic tumor control, yet sex-specific differences in these responses remain largely unexplored. We investigated sex-associated signals in outcomes of combined RT-ICI in a multicenter cohort. We analyzed the incidence of AbE and survival outcomes with respect to clinical and biomedical markers. Methods In this observational multicenter study, patients with metastatic solid tumors receiving RT-ICI and showing at least one non-irradiated lesion (NIL), assessed using iRECIST criteria, were analyzed. Abscopal response (AR) was defined as ≥30% reduction in NIL size, abscopal progression (AP) as ≥20% increase, and abscopal control (AC) as changes within this range. Results Among 3,773 screened patients, 142 met the inclusion criteria (62% male, median age 62 years; 38% female, median age 58 years). AR and AC occurred more frequently in females (24% vs. 14%, 35% vs. 31%). While OS showed no significant difference (p=0.81), Cox regression analyses revealed significant associations of a longer ICI-to-RT-interval (males: HR = 0.903 [0.833–0.978], p=0.012; females: HR = 0.748 [0.621–0.900], p=0.002) and a BMI ≥25 kg/m² with survival in both sexes (males: HR = 4.282 [1.473–12.446], p=0.008; females: HR = 4.801 [1.182–19.502], p=0.028 with survival in both sexes). Elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (≥5 mg/L) showed prognostic significance only in males (HR = 4.764 [1.184–19.170], p=0.028). Conclusion Our findings suggest the possibility of sex-specific patterns in AbE occurrence. Additionally, our analyses identified sex-associated prognostic factors, including the importance of ICI-to-RT interval and BMI in both sexes and the male-specific prognostic value of CRP. These observations warrant further research and consideration in designing personalized RT-ICI combination strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Shark-derived single-domain antibodies, known as VNARs, represent unique and advanced tools in medical biotechnology. Recognized for their small size, simple structure, and exceptional stability, VNARs can access cryptic epitopes that are inaccessible to traditional antibodies, making them valuable tools for next-generation diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Additionally, their evolutionary origin and structural diversity provide resistance to extreme pH, temperature, and proteolytic environments, making them especially suitable for demanding biomedical settings such as ocular and intestinal applications. Recent progress highlights their growing clinical potential: VNAR-based CAR-T cells targeting PD-L1 demonstrated strong anti-tumor effects in preclinical assays, with VNAR-B2 successfully blocking PD-L1/PD-1 interactions and reducing tumor growth in mouse models. Meanwhile, the TXB2 VNAR platform allows efficient, non-invasive transport of biologics across the blood-brain barrier. These developments emphasize VNARs’ advantages over traditional antibodies and even camelid VHHs in targeting difficult-to-reach sites and environments. Additionally, commercial development in VNAR technologies is advancing, with companies like Elasmogen using its soloMER™ platform to develop shark-derived, humanized single-domain antibodies for challenging therapeutic environments. This review consolidates emerging insights into VNAR structural biology, display technologies (phage, ribosome, yeast, and bacterial), and library engineering strategies, emphasizing their growing role in immunodiagnostics, infectious disease detection, targeted therapies, and barrier-crossing biologics. It addresses key translational challenges such as humanization and half-life extension, which are crucial for clinical application, ultimately highlighting the transformative potential of VNARs in bridging vital gaps in modern medicine.",

However, its clinical application is limited by a lack of standardized detection methods and concerns about preanalytical variability. Objectives This study aims to evaluate the impact of preanalytical factors (delayed processing of blood and repeated thawing/freezing) on serum CHI3L1 levels. Additionally, we sought to correlate CHI3L1 blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels and identified its cellular source in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from MS patients. Methods We used an in-house Single Molecule Array (Simoa) assay to measure CHI3L1 levels in serum, plasma, and CSF from MS patients and controls. The source of CHI3L1 production in PBMCs was determined by flow cytometry. Results A strong correlation was found between serum, plasma, and CSF CHI3L1 levels. Serum CHI3L1 levels remained stable with delayed processing up to 6 hours and for up to three freeze-thaw cycles. Monocytes, particularly classical monocytes (CD14 ++ CD16 - cells), were identified as the main producers of CHI3L1 in PBMCs. Conclusions The study establishes preanalytical guidelines for sCHI3L1 assessment and confirms that blood levels can be as informative as CSF levels.

    "Abstract": "Introduction SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by immune system dysregulation, including aberrant activation of B and T lymphocytes and overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-21. Through the STAT3 signaling pathway, this cytokine plays a key role in SLE-promoting autoantibody production and immune imbalance. It has been reported that miRNAs, such as miR-155 and miR-21, could be overexpressed in SLE and contribute to the STAT3 pathway dysregulation. We aimed to analyze the association between miR-155 and miR-21 and the expression of SOCS1 , PTEN , PIAS3 , and IL21 in PBMC from SLE patients. Materials and methods PBMC isolation was performed by density gradient centrifugation using Histopaque-1077, culture overnight, and seeded at a concentration of 1x10 6 cells/mL in 24-well flat-bottom cell culture plates for subsequent stimulation with 0.5 μg/mL ionomycin and 2.5 μg/mL PMA. The expression levels of miR-155, miR-21, SOCS1, PTEN, PIAS3 , and IL21 were measured using the RT-qPCR technique. Western blotting determined the expression of SOCS1, PTEN, PIAS3, IL-21, and p-STAT3 proteins. IL-17A levels in cell culture supernatant were determined using ELISA to assess cell stimulation. Results Our results showed an increased expression of miR-155 and miR-21 in SLE patients compared to HC in both, stimulated and non-stimulated PBMC. The increased miR-155 and miR-21 expression were associated with a decreased gene expression of SOCS1 and PTEN . The IL21 expression was observed in stimulated PBMC with higher levels in SLE patients. These also showed lower expression of SOCS1, PTEN, and PIAS3, while levels of IL-21 were increased in total protein from PBMC, culture cell supernatants and plasma levels. Overall, p-STAT3 was increased in the PBMC of SLE patients. Finally, miR-21 inversely correlated with PIAS3 and PTEN and miR-155 with SOCS1. Discussion These findings highlight the association between miR-155 and miR-21 with target genes SOCS1, PTEN, and PIAS3, that may contribute to the aberrant activation of the STAT3 pathway and the overproduction of IL-21 in SLE patients.",

    "Abstract": "With advances in microbial sequencing technology, the role of microorganisms in cancer development and treatment has been increasingly explored. The gut microbiota, as a key shaper of both innate and adaptive immunity, is believed to migrate from the gut and colonize the pancreas, thereby influencing the tumor microenvironment(TME) of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer exhibits treatment resistance due to its immunosuppressive TME and high interstitial density. Multiple sequencing analyses of pancreatic tumor tissues have revealed that alterations in the tumor-associated microbiota are associated with prognosis and treatment response, suggesting that the microbiota may serve as a complementary modality in immunotherapy. This paper describes potential pathways by which the gut microbiota can migrate to the pancreas and analyzes changes in tumor microbiota composition. It also identifies microbiota types associated with prognosis, and summarizes treatment strategies leveraging the gut-pancreas axis to enhance the personalization and precision of care. It critically examines the limitations of existing research, and aims to leverage microbiome ecology to overcome the immune -suppressive barrier in pancreatic cancer and improve patient outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction The immunological drivers of portal hypertension regression after hepatitis C virus (HCV) cure are poorly understood, particularly in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection We aimed to identify baseline immune signatures predicting the evolution of the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) in people with and without HIV (PWH/PWoH). Methods We prospectively followed 41 individuals with advanced cirrhosis (18 PWoH, 23 PWH) who were cured of HCV with direct-acting antivirals (DAA). Baseline plasma and cellular immune markers were extensively profiled using multiplex assays and flow cytometry. We used mixed-effects modeling to test for associations between these baseline immune features and the change in HVPG over a 48-week follow-up period, with q-values controlling for false discoveries. Results Two distinct immunological profiles of impaired HVPG regression emerged. In PWoH, impaired regression was linked to a broad proinflammatory profile [TNF-α (AMR = 1.13; q=0.012), IL17A (AMR = 1.28; q=0.012), and IL10 (AMR = 1.2; q=0.028)], a widespread total CD4+ T-cell activation [HLA-DR+ (AMR = 1.44; q&amp;lt;0.001) and CD38+HLA-DR+ (AMR = 1.3; q=0.007)], and robust activation across central memory (CM) and effector memory (EM) subsets. Conversely, in PWH, impaired HVPG regression was associated with sVCAM-1 (AMR = 1.58; q=0.096), and a more focused activation within EM (HLA-DR+, AMR = 1.08; q=0.030) and TemRA (CD38+HLA-DR+, AMR = 1.12; q=0.030) CD4+ T-cells. Discussion HIV coinfection fundamentally reshapes the immunological landscape of post-cure portal hypertension recovery. The shift from systemic inflammation in PWoH to endothelial dysfunction and T-cell exhaustion in PWH reveals distinct pathological pathways. Understanding these signatures is a crucial step toward developing targeted therapies to promote complete hepatic recovery.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs. Some patients still develop severe refractory SLE despite conventional treatments. Belimumab, a biologic targeting B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), shows therapeutic promise in SLE, but its effects on pediatric patients remain unclear. Methods This study used CyTOF to analyze immunophenotypic changes before and after belimumab treatment and investigate immune features in refractory SLE. Results Results showed that belimumab treatment primarily reduced transitional and naïve B cells, and also decreased age-associated B cells (ABCs), a subset implicated in autoimmunity or chronic inflammation. Plasma cells and plasmablasts persisted in refractory cases. CD38 expression on B cells was elevated in severe disease and correlated with disease activity, while CD73 expression increased during recovery and inversely correlated with activity. Discussion These findings indicate that combining belimumab with conventional therapy induces significant immune modulation, particularly within B cells. Persistent plasma cells and plasmablasts may contribute to disease refractoriness. CD38 and the CD73-mediated adenosine pathway may provide insights for future research strategies in SLE.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To evaluate the clinical relevance of the C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR) in patients with autoimmune encephalitis (AE), with an emphasis on its predictive utility for disease severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and functional outcomes. Methods A retrospective cohort of 114 patients with AE was analyzed. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and albumin (ALB) levels were measured within 24 hours of admission, and CAR was subsequently calculated. Disease severity was assessed using the Clinical Assessment Scale for Autoimmune Encephalitis (CASE) and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge. Statistical analyses included the Mann–Whitney U test, Spearman correlation, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to evaluate associations with ICU admission, respiratory failure, and disability. Results Patients requiring ICU admission exhibited significantly elevated CRP levels (11.00 vs. 2.40 mg/L, p &amp;lt; 0.001), reduced ALB levels (36.00 vs. 38.00 g/L, p = 0.029), and higher CAR values (0.282 vs. 0.064, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Comparable patterns were observed in patients with respiratory failure and severe disability (mRS ≥ 3). CAR demonstrated stronger correlations with both CASE score at admission (r = 0.448, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and mRS at discharge (r = 0.222, p = 0.018) than either CRP or ALB alone. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, sex, CASE score, and other potential confounders, identified CAR (OR = 2.100; 95% CI: 1.151–3.831; p = 0.016), CRP (OR = 1.023; 95% CI: 1.004–1.042; p = 0.015), and ALB (OR = 0.875; 95% CI: 0.787–0.973; p = 0.013) as independent predictors of ICU admission. ROC curve analysis indicated high predictive accuracy for CAR (AUC = 0.835; cutoff = 0.125; sensitivity = 91.3%) and CRP (AUC = 0.820; cutoff = 4.35; sensitivity = 82.6%). Conclusion CAR represents a novel and readily accessible biomarker that outperforms CRP or ALB alone in predicting disease severity and the need for ICU care in patients with AE. Its incorporation into early clinical assessment protocols may enhance risk stratification and inform decisions regarding intensive care resource allocation.",

    "Abstract": "The global prevalence of erectile dysfunction (ED) continues to rise, which has become an important issue affecting the physical and mental health of men. Existing evidence suggests that ED is closely related to various immune-mediated skin diseases. This review elaborates on the epidemiological characteristics, potential mechanisms, and clinical management strategies of ED associated with immune-mediated skin diseases. It discusses the future research directions and challenges in this field. Epidemiological studies consistently show that the prevalence of ED in such patients is higher than that in the general population, indicating that immune-mediated skin diseases may significantly increase the risk of ED. Its pathogenesis is complex and diverse, involving the interaction of multiple pathways. In terms of clinical management, a multidisciplinary collaborative model is advocated, with the active control of the inflammatory activity of the primary skin disease as the cornerstone of treatment. The treatment of ED should be individualized, combined with psychological intervention and lifestyle optimization, to comprehensively improve the treatment effect. Future research should further explore its molecular mechanisms and conduct large-sample, prospective clinical trials to optimize treatment strategies and ultimately enhance patients’ sexual health and overall quality of life (QoL).",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by chronic neuroinflammation and loss of dopaminergic neurons. The neurotoxin MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) selectively targets dopaminergic neurons, effectively replicating the pathological features of PD. Lupeol, a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid, has been shown to exhibit neuroprotective properties in various models by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of lupeol in an MPTP-induced mouse model of PD. Methods Male mice were administered MPTP (30 mg/kg, i.p.) for seven days to induce PD-like pathology. Lupeol (50 mg/kg) was administered as a potential therapeutic intervention. Behavioral assessments were conducted to evaluate motor function. Biochemical analyses were performed to measure dopamine and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels. Immunohistochemical and molecular approaches were used to assess glial activation, oxidative stress, and apoptotic signaling pathways in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum. Results Lupeol treatment significantly improved MPTP-induced motor impairments and restored dopamine and TH levels. Additionally, lupeol reduced neuroinflammation, by decreasing microglial activation, astrocyte reactivity, and lower levels of inflammatory mediators. Oxidative stress markers, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO), were diminished in SNpc and striatum following lupeol treatment. Furthermore, lupeol upregulated antioxidant defense mechanisms by increasing the expression of Nrf-2 and HO-1. Apoptotic markers, such as Cytochrome C, Bax, and Caspase-3, were downregulated, indicating reduced neuronal apoptosis. Conclusion The current study suggests that lupeol exerts neuroprotective effects by inhibiting glial cell activation, thereby reducing neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in an MPTP-induced PD mouse model.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Neurological complications are increasingly recognized as a significant consequence of COVID-19; however, time-resolved, brain-specific characterization of transcriptional alterations underlying SARS-CoV-2–associated neuroinflammation and neuronal injury remain limited. We hypothesized that brain transcriptional responses evolve dynamically during acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in temporal transcriptional programs. Methods KRT18-hACE2 transgenic mice were intranasally inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Brain was harvested at 4 and 6 days post-infection (dpi) for analyses. Results Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed a broad spectrum of viral neurotropism and gliotropism, accompanied by an increased apoptotic burden, particularly in cortical neurons (ClCas3/SATB2+). Robust activation of myeloid cells (Iba1+/CD68+) provided evidence of neuroinflammation. Cytokine/chemokine profiling demonstrated pronounced upregulation of inflammatory mediators (CXCL10, IL-12p40, CCL12), alongside reduced CX3CL1, suggesting impaired neuron–microglia communication. Whole-transcriptome and gene ontology analyses uncovered stage-dependent molecular programs, with early alterations at 4 dpi enriched in protein ubiquitination, vesicle trafficking, and synaptic processes, followed by intensified innate immune activation and engagement of chromosomal maintenance pathways at 6 dpi. In parallel, pronounced suppression of mitochondrial function at 6 dpi, pointing to energy exhaustion and transcriptional-translational discordance, as supported by digital PCR and a substantial reduction in COXIV protein levels. Discussion These findings provide a time-resolved molecular landscape of SARS-CoV-2–induced neuroinflammation and metabolic stress, highlighting CNS vulnerability during severe infection and suggesting pathways potentially relevant to COVID-19-associated sequelae.",

    "Abstract": "Background Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an aggressive malignancy with endemic prevalence in southern China. Emerging evidence highlights the critical function of the N6-methyladenosine (m 6 A) methylation in NPC progression, where sustained cytokine activity contributes to immunosuppression and immune evasion. Methods Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing datasets were obtained from the GEO database. High-dimensional downstream analyses, including hdWGCNA, cell–cell communication, and pseudotime analysis was performed to characterize cellular interactions and transcriptional programs. Machine learning algorithms and immune infiltration profiling were integrated with MeRIP-seq to identify the key m 6 A-regulated gene. The post-transcriptional regulatory role was further validated in NPC cells with overexpression or knockdown of METTL14, or in cells with YWHAH silenced. Results B cells were identified as the primary senders to the TNF pathway, with epithelial and myeloid cells acting as influencers and receivers. YWHAH emerged as a key TNF-associated, m 6 A-regulated gene, with elevated expression in naive/GC B cells, interleukin (IL)-1β+ tumor-associated macrophages, and differentiated epithelial cells. METTL14-deficient increased YWHAH transcript abundance and RNA stability, whereas TNF-α stimulation further enhanced YWHAH expression. Conversely, YWHAH knockdown impaired NPC cell migration and upregulated IL−6/IL−8 expression, effects that were partially rescued by TNF−α treatment. Conclusion Integration of multi-omics data facilitated the identification of YWHAH as a METTL14-regulated gene, which plays a pivotal role in the NPC immune microenvironment. The elevated expression of YWHAH indicates its role in regulating immune balance. Together these findings suggest a potential regulatory link between TNF-α, YWHAH and METTL14 in the context of NPC.",

Soluble fermentable dietary fiber (SFDF) is a safe, accessible nutritional factor that may support cognition through microglial remodeling and antioxidant defense, but its dose–response effects and cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Methods We combined three levels of evidence (1). In 2,350 older adults from NHANES (2011–2014), weighted regression and spline modeling assessed the association between total dietary fiber intake and cognitive performance. (2) In a D-galactose–induced aging mouse model, inulin supplementation (as a representative SFDF) was tested for effects on behavior, cytokines, and oxidative stress. (3) We analyzed an independent single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset of naturally aged mice receiving a 5% SFDF intervention to characterize microglial state remodeling. Results Higher total dietary fiber intake was nonlinearly associated with better cognition, with ~15 g/day as the threshold for maximal benefit. In mice, SFDF improved memory and learning, alleviated anxiety-like behavior, reduced IL-6, TNF-α, and lipid peroxidation, and enhanced antioxidant defenses. Single-nucleus analyses indicated that the 5% SFDF intervention was associated with a shift toward a reparative Mic.7 microglial subtype enriched for immune regulation and oxidative defense programs. Conclusions These convergent population, animal, and single-cell findings support a model in which higher total dietary fiber intake is associated with better late-life cognition, and SFDF interventions can attenuate aging-related neuroimmune activation and oxidative stress in experimental systems, highlighting dietary fiber as a scalable nutritional strategy to support healthy cognitive aging.",

The role of ferroptosis in AAA pathogenesis remains insufficiently understood. This study aims to investigate the role of ferroptosis in AAA by identifying ferroptosis-associated molecular subtypes and examining their relationship with immunological characteristics using an artificial neural network (ANN) model. Methods We analyzed three publicly available datasets (GSE7084, GSE47472, and GSE57691) to identify differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) and employed consensus clustering to classify AAA samples into two subtypes. Immune infiltration was assessed with the CIBERSORT algorithm, and a diagnostic artificial neural network (ANN) model based on subtype-specific genes was developed to discriminate ferroptosis-associated molecular subtypes and derive the NeuraAAA score. Results Nine differentially expressed FRGs were identified, and the model incorporated three key genes (oncostatin M, heme oxygenase-1, and interleukin-6), achieving high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.988). Consensus clustering stratified AAA samples into two ferroptosis-associated subtypes with distinct immune profiles, with the C1 subtype showing higher immune infiltration and immune scores than C2. The derived NeuraAAA score was elevated in the immune-enriched subtype and correlated with immune-cell infiltration, and a nomogram integrating NeuraAAA and immune score showed good calibration. Immunofluorescence confirmed increased expression of all three genes in AAA specimens. Conclusion Our study reveals the heterogeneous role of ferroptosis in AAA pathogenesis, demonstrating that ferroptosis-associated subtypes are linked to variations in the immune microenvironment. These findings provide new insights into AAA pathophysiology and suggest potential targets for subtype-specific therapeutic strategies, contributing to advances in precision medicine for AAA treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To assess platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) prognostic utility for overall (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in immune checkpoint inhibitor-treated cancer patients, and examine impacts of geography, cancer type, cutoff, ICI class, treatment line and stage. Methods A systematic literature search identified studies investigating PLR and prognosis in ICI treated patients. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses examined key covariates; publication bias was assessed. Results Analysis of 98 publications (86 OS, 72 PFS) demonstrated that elevated PLR was a robust predictor of shorter OS (HR 1.79, 95% CI: 1.60-2.00) and PFS (HR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.44-1.78). Subgroup analyses revealed: (1) Geographic region: Asian populations exhibited the most consistent correlation with OS and the highest PFS risk (69%). (2) Cancer type: For OS, prognostic value was maintained across all cancers; the most pronounced impacts were observed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HR 2.10), esophageal carcinoma (HR 2.08), and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HR 2.61). For PFS, a notable link to poor outcomes was observed in NSCLC and hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas renal cell carcinoma showed no such correlation. (3) PLR cutoff: both PLR ≥180 (OS: HR 1.87; PFS: HR 1.68) and PLR &amp;lt;180 (OS: HR 1.73; PFS: HR 1.53) subgroups consistently yielded unfavorable outcomes. (4) ICI category: for OS, camrelizumab showed the strongest prognostic relevance (HR 4.68), whereas for PFS, all ICIs yielded consistent results. (5) Treatment line: both first-line (OS: HR 1.98; PFS: HR 1.93) and second-line or beyond (OS: HR 1.87; PFS: HR 1.79) demonstrated clear prognostic utility without inter-subgroup differences. (6) Tumor stage: Advanced stages (III–IV, IIIB–IV, IV) confirmed the predictive value of PLR for both OS and PFS. (7) Cancer Subtypes: PLR remained prognostic in nivolumab-treated, stage IV genitourinary cancers; correlated with survival in pembrolizumab-treated but not nivolumab-treated NSCLC; and remained predictive in camrelizumab-treated/advanced gastrointestinal tumors. Notably, elevated PLR was uniquely associated with worsened OS and PFS in nivolumab-treated renal cell carcinoma. Conclusions Elevated PLR is consistently associated with shortened OS across the cancer types receiving ICIs, while its prognostic value for PFS fluctuates depending on cancer type and ICI class. The prognostic impact of PLR is particularly robust in the nivolumab-treated RCC, pembrolizumab-treated NSCLC, camrelizumab-treated gastrointestinal tumors, and various advanced-stage malignancies.

    "Abstract": "Background Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) offers unique reconstructive solutions for severe tissue loss, restoring form and function. Acute and chronic rejection remains a significant barrier, with acute episodes occurring in most recipients and chronic rejection persisting as the leading cause of graft failure. Unlike solid organ transplantation, VCA involves highly immunogenic tissues, like skin and mucosa, making rejection more frequent and challenging to manage. Methods A systematic review was conducted following PRISMA 2020, searching PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science for original human VCA studies reporting immunosuppressive protocols and outcomes in acute or chronic rejection. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale and Level of Evidence; extracted data included demographics, regimens, rejection episodes, treatments, and graft survival. Results Fourty-six studies (136 recipients) met inclusion criteria: upper extremity (n=69; 51%), face (n=33; 24%), abdominal wall (n=33; 24%), scalp and penile (each n=1; 0.7%). Acute rejection occurred in 81/136 (60%) within year 1, most often at POW 1–2 (n=52), 5–12 (n=42), and 13–52 (n=30). Severity was Banff grade I (n=49; 36%), II (n=73; 54%), III (n=50; 37%), and severe IV (n=1; 0.7%). Common symptoms included skin lesions (n=43; 32%), edema (n=32; 24%), erythema (n=29; 21%), and rash (n=15; 11%), with some experiencing numbness (n=4; 2.9%), tingling (n=5; 3.7%), or burning sensations (n=5; 3.7%). Corticosteroids were the mainstay (n=98; 72%)—methylprednisolone (n=31; 23%), clobetasol (n=15; 11%), and prednisone (n=11; 8.1%); tacrolimus was used in 49 (36%), including topical in 29 (21%). Other immunosuppressants included antithymocyte globulin (n=19; 14%), alemtuzumab (n=11; 8.1%), mycophenolate mofetil (n=11; 8.1%), and rituximab (n=6; 4.4%); basiliximab (n=4; 2.9%), sirolimus (n=2; 1.5%), and plasmapheresis (n=4; 2.9%) were used selectively. Monotherapy was used in 42 episodes, and dual therapy in 51, most commonly methylprednisolone plus topical tacrolimus (n=26). Conclusion This review underscores the ongoing challenge of rejection in VCA and the need for improved treatment strategies, with corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and mycophenolate mofetil remaining standard while emerging biologicals offer promise. Acute rejection is often manageable yet threatens graft survival, whereas chronic rejection is less reported, likely under-recognized and harder to treat, underscoring need for novel immunomodulators, standardized protocols, and prevention to improve outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Background Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Among various metabolic pathways, bile acids act not only as crucial metabolites but also as key signaling molecules that regulate diverse physiological and pathological processes in the liver. However, the biological functions and clinical implications of bile acid metabolism in HCC progression remain largely unclear. Methods Single-cell transcriptomic data from 67 patients with HCC were integrated to construct a bile acid metabolism scoring system. Pseudotime trajectory analysis was employed to characterize the differentiation patterns of cells exhibiting abnormal bile acid metabolism. Spatial transcriptomics was used to explore their spatial distribution features. Furthermore, machine learning algorithms were applied to analyze transcriptomic data from HCC cohorts to develop a prognostic prediction model. The findings were complemented by immune infiltration analysis, molecular characterization, and drug sensitivity prediction using CellMiner, followed by molecular docking validation. Results G6PD + malignant tumor cells with high bile acid metabolism scores exhibited enhanced bile acid metabolic activity, accompanied by activation of macrophages and endothelial cells. These cells were predominantly localized at the tumor boundary region. A prognostic prediction model based on G6PD + expression successfully identified a high-risk subgroup with significantly poorer outcomes. In vitro experiments demonstrated that knockdown or overexpression of G6PD markedly affected the proliferative, migratory, and invasive capacities of HCC cells. Conclusion This study reveals that bile acid metabolism promotes HCC progression by facilitating vascular network formation and establishing an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The bile acid metabolism scoring system may serve as a novel prognostic biomarker and provide a theoretical foundation for developing precision therapeutic strategies in HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Optic nerve injury, encompassing conditions such as glaucoma, optic neuritis, and traumatic optic neuropathy, is a major cause of irreversible vision loss. Traditional broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory treatments have shown limited efficacy, highlighting the need for precision-based therapeutic approaches grounded in the underlying pathological mechanisms. As the primary immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), microglia play a crucial role in regulating neuroinflammation following optic nerve injury. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms governing microglial neuroinflammatory regulation, including early inflammatory signal recognition mediated by damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), dynamic transcriptional networks regulating polarization between pro-inflammatory and pro-repair phenotypes, bidirectional modulation of phagocytic clearance by the complement system, and the complex multicellular interactions among microglia, astrocytes, and Müller cells. The concept of conditioning injury conditioning injury (intraocular inflammatory stimulation) has revealed the dual nature of neuroinflammatory responses: through temporal polarization shifts, microglia can both release neurotoxic mediators that worsen injury and secrete neurotrophic factors that promote axonal regeneration and myelin repair. This shift from traditional broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory strategies to precision functional modulation forms the basis for emerging therapeutic approaches, including PPARγ pathway activation, selective complement system targeting, and time-dependent modulation. We also assess the potential of advanced technologies, such as nanodelivery systems, single-cell analysis, and molecular imaging, in precision diagnosis and treatment. Finally, we critically examine the limitations of current research, including interspecies variability, model constraints, and clinical translation barriers, and discuss the translational potential of microglia-targeted therapies in protecting and restoring clinically meaningful visual function.",

    "Abstract": "The development of endometrial cancer is a gradual malignant transformation process driven by multiple factors, and the immune microenvironment is closely related to clinical outcomes and immunotherapy responses. Under physiological conditions, the immune microenvironment of the normal endometrium undergoes periodic reshaping under the regulation of estrogen and progesterone, maintaining the balance between immune defense and reproductive capacity. However, continuous exposure to risk factors, such as non-antagonistic estrogen, may trigger endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. During this period, the immune microenvironment becomes dysregulated, supporting malignant progression. For example, estrogen-stimulated interactions between endothelial cells and macrophages, elevated neutrophil/lymphocyte ratios, and the accumulation of regulatory T cells all combine to cause dysregulation of immune microenvironment. The abnormal immune microenvironment that occurs in the precancerous lesion stage interacts with systemic and genetic carcinogenic factors, ultimately shaping the unique immune microenvironment of each molecular subtype of endometrial cancer. POLE-mutated and MSI-H subtype endometrial cancer are immune-infiltrated tumors, whereas the copy-number high subtype is immune-suppressive tumor and the copy-number low subtype is immune-desert tumor. However, still little is known about the immune dysregulation that occurs during the precancerous stage and its impact on subsequent malignant progression. This review systematically describes the changes in the immune microenvironment during the process from normal endometrium to endometrial cancer, emphasizing that endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia is a key stage of immune imbalance, thus paving the way for early immune intervention and precise immunotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) cause a high economic burden with frequent medical visits, and in severe cases can lead to hospitalization due to complications like bacteremia or sepsis. UTIs are treated with antibiotics; however, this contributes to the emergence of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) bacterial strains because of misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is the most common cause of UTIs and is commonly associated with antibiotic resistance. Several host defense mechanisms including the urothelial barrier, antimicrobial peptides, and complement protect the urinary tract from infection. If UPEC is encountered, a pro-inflammatory immune response starts to combat the infection, with antimicrobial peptides and protein as a first line of defense followed by the activation of the innate and adaptive immune responses. These innate and adaptive immune responses are sometimes inadequate during established UTI, and recurrence of UTI is common. In addition, an overactivation of the immune response to UPEC causes immunopathologic damage to tissues and cells. Anti- E. coli vaccines have been proposed as an ideal approach both to improve the immune response to infection and to limit the emergence and spread of AMR strains. Currently, a few UTI vaccines have been licensed in a couple of countries but are not broadly approved and novel vaccines are being explored. In this review, we focus on the pro-inflammatory response to UPEC infections and the immunopathologic effects of an overactive pro-inflammatory response during UTIs in humans. We highlight the components of the immune response during UTI that can be utilized for the development of a preventative UPEC vaccine.",

    "Abstract": "Arrhythmia is a prevalent complication associated with various cardiovascular diseases. The onset of cardiac disease or injury can impair the normal function of cardiomyocytes, thereby precipitating arrhythmic events. Moreover, non-cardiomyocytes, including immune cells, may also play a contributory role in arrhythmogenesis. For instance, processes such as the infiltration of inflammatory cells that secrete pro-inflammatory mediators, fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transformation, and endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition have all been implicated in this process. Recent investigations have identified a distinct subset of resident macrophages within cardiac tissue that exhibit functional properties differing from those of bone marrow-derived macrophages. Cardiac tissue-resident macrophages (CRMs) are distinguished from bone marrow-derived macrophages by their developmental origin, transcriptomic profile, and functional traits. Beyond their canonical immune functions shared with bone marrow-derived macrophages, CRMs uniquely contribute to cardiac homeostasis by exerting direct electrophysiological modulation via ion channels and gap junctions. This constitutes a distinct mechanism underlying their role in arrhythmogenesis. Advanced methodologies, such as patch-clamp electrophysiology, high-throughput sequencing, and proteomic analyses in mammalian models, have revealed the complex electrophysiological interactions between CRMs and cardiomyocytes. While both CRMs and bone marrow-derived macrophages play roles in arrhythmia initiation and progression, existing reviews have primarily focused on bone marrow-derived macrophages. This review seeks to clarify the electrophysiological properties of CRMs and to delineate the specific mechanisms through which these cells contribute to arrhythmogenesis, thereby providing novel perspectives for the development of anti-arrhythmic therapeutic strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Background Penile cancer (PeCa) is a rare but aggressive disease where lymph node metastases (LNM) represent the most significant prognostic factor. Accurate identification of LNM remains a clinical priority, but traditional imaging and clinical parameters often fail to detect occult LNM. Soluble immune checkpoint proteins (sICs) have recently emerged as potential non-invasive biomarkers in various malignancies, although unexplored in PeCa. The primary aim of this study was to explore the value of a panel of 14 sICs for predicting LNM in PeCa. The secondary aim was to compare plasma sIC levels between PeCa patients and cancer-free controls. Methods Using ProcartaPlex immunoassays, BTLA, IDO, LAG-3, HVEM, PD-1, PD-L1, PD-L2, TIM-3, CD80, CTLA-4, GITR, CD27, CD28, and CD137 were measured in plasma from 284 PeCa patients and 45 cancer-free controls. PeCa patients were divided into a training set (n=202) and a test set (n=82). A prediction model for LNM was created using logistic regression. Results Overall accuracy of the prediction model reached 77.5% (95% CI: 70.9 - 83.3) for the training set, yielding 8.9% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity in predicting LNM. Upon validation using the test set, the accuracy decreased to 62.2% (95% CI: 50.8-72.7) with 17.9% sensitivity and 85.2% specificity. When comparing PeCa patients and cancer-free controls, four inhibitory sICs (IDO, TIM-3, CD80, and CTLA-4) were found at significantly higher levels in the PeCa group. Due to the rarity of the disease, the main limitation of the study is the small number of patients with LNM. Conclusion Our study provides no evidence that sICs can predict LNM in PeCa, although four inhibitory sICs were significantly elevated in PeCa patients compared to cancer-free controls, suggesting systemic immunosuppression associated with tumor presence, consistent with findings in other malignancies. Studies with larger cohorts are warranted to clarify the prognostic significance of sICs in PeCa.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Systemic sclerosis (Scleroderma; SSc) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, particularly in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (SSc-PAH) and pulmonary fibrosis (SSc-PF). Effective risk stratification and treatment of SSc remains a significant challenge. This proof-of-concept study aimed to identify potential biomarkers capable of distinguishing between three SSc patient groups, defined by no pulmonary involvement (SSc-NLD; n=30), SSc-PAH (n=30), SSc-PF (n=30) compared to healthy controls (HC; n=30). Methods The study employed Olink-based proteomics using the Cardiovascular II and Immuno-oncology panels, and untargeted metabolomic profiling using Ultra-high Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS), to discover distinct molecular signatures. Results Proteomics analysis revealed significantly elevated levels of MCP-1, MCP-3, and MCP-4 in SSc-PF compared to all other groups. However, no robust discriminatory cytokines were identified for SSc-PAH or SSc-NLD. Validation of systemic MCP-1 and IL-6 by ELISA supported the proteomics findings. IL-33 levels were found to be reduced in the SSc-PAH group. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory sIL-6R were also identified in SSc-PAH and SSc-PF, indicating shared inflammatory pathways. Protein-protein interaction analyses demonstrated greater network complexity in SSc-PF, with pathway analysis suggesting overlapping biological mechanisms across pulmonary groups. Metabolomics analysis uncovered a unique panel of metabolites altered exclusively in SSc-PAH, including quinolinate, dimethylarginines, hydroxyasparagine and orotidine. In contrast, no metabolites were uniquely discriminatory for SSc-PF or SSc-NLD. Metabolite-metabolite interaction networks revealed nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism as the more significantly enriched metabolic pathways in SSc-PAH. Correlation analyses identified distinct protein-metabolite profiles across groups. Of note is the loss of IL-33-related metabolic associations specific to SSc-PAH. Discussion This study identified a candidate biomarker panel comprising three cytokines and ten metabolites capable of differentiating between SSc-PAH, SSc-PF, SSc-NLD, and HC. Biomarkers of SSc-PAH were linked to nicotinate and nicotinamide, as well as tryptophan metabolism, whereas those of SSc-PF reflected immune cell infiltration and fibrosis. These findings highlight the potential biomarker panels for diagnosis and targeted therapeutic development.",

    "Abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is an immunogenic tumor in which tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) represent a functionally important component of the tumor microenvironment. Recent studies have revealed pronounced phenotypic heterogeneity of RCC-infiltrating neutrophils, including interferon-responsive, immunosuppressive PMN-MDSC-like, pro-angiogenic, and NET-forming subsets that cannot be adequately described by the classical N1/N2 model. Their polarization is shaped by ELR + CXC chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL8), cytokine signals, systemic inflammation, hypoxia driven by VHL/HIF pathways, and tumor-intrinsic oncogenic alterations such as PTEN loss, ERβ- and c-Myc–dependent programs, as well as epigenetic remodeling. TANs exert predominantly pro-tumor functions in RCC, promoting T-cell exclusion and exhaustion, supporting angiogenesis and stromal remodeling, and facilitating epithelial–mesenchymal transition, venous invasion and metastasis. NETs, enriched in hypoxic and necrotic tumor regions and in venous tumor thrombi, further contribute to vascular occlusion, metastatic dissemination and local immune dysfunction, and are reflected by distinct transcriptional signatures. Clinically, high TAN density, activation markers and neutrophil/NET-associated gene signatures are consistently associated with aggressive tumor behavior, early recurrence, poor survival and resistance to VEGF-TKIs and immune checkpoint inhibitors. Emerging data also link neutrophil-rich stromal inflammation with the tumor resident microbiome, suggesting composite TAN-microbiome biomarkers for refined risk stratification. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on phenotypic diversity, regulatory circuits and functional programs of TANs and NETs in RCC, and discuss their prognostic and predictive significance, as well as therapeutic strategies aimed at chemokine blockade, complement modulation, NET inhibition and neutrophil re-education.",

This study aims to describe the clinical and molecular characteristics of IEI in a highly consanguineous population and investigate the impact of genetic diagnosis on patient management. Method This retrospective study included 52 patients with suspected IEI, as defined by the IUIS criteria. Clinical, immunological, and demographic data were recorded. Genetic analyses were performed primarily using next-generation sequencing (NGS) gene panels, and all pathogenic variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Variants were interpreted in accordance with the ACMG guidelines. Results A total of 52 patients were included in the study, with 92% of the individuals born to consanguineous parents, comprising 28 females and 24 males. The mean age at diagnosis was 4.63 ± 2.5 years. The median duration of follow-up was three years. The overall incidence was 0.3% representing the proportion of patients diagnosed with IEI among those referred to our center during the study period. A high rate of consanguineous marriage was observed, reported in 92% of the cases. The most frequently represented category was Predominantly Antibody Deficiencies (PAD), accounting for 20 patients (38.5%), including 12 cases (23%) of transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI) and 7 cases (13%) of selective IgA deficiency. Among the 52 patients, 3 (5.8%) were diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): 1 patient had ADA deficiency, and two patients had DNA ligase IV deficiency (LIG4). Additionally, 14 patients (26%) were diagnosed with combined Immunodeficiencies (CID). Thirty patients were treated with IVIG, and 3 patients underwent HSCT. A molecular diagnosis was established in 33 patients (63%). Genetic findings influenced clinical management in 82% of variant-positive cases, including decisions regarding HSCT, targeted therapy, and genetic counseling. Conclusion This study highlights the distinctive genetic characteristics of IEI in a population with high consanguinity, emphasizing the need to incorporate molecular diagnostics into standard immunology practice, particularly in areas where recessive disorders are prevalent.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) is a major veterinary pathogen causing significant economic losses in the livestock industry. Despite its impact, effective vaccines and targeted antiviral strategies remain limited, largely due to an incomplete understanding of host factors regulating viral replication and pathogenesis. Methods To systematically identify host genes essential for EHV-1 infection, we established a BHK-21 cell line stably expressing Cas9 and performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen using a pooled lentiviral single-guide RNA library. Significantly enriched candidate genes from positive selection were validated by generating knockout cell lines. Viral replication and protein expression were assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. Pathway enrichment and protein interaction network analyses were subsequently conducted. Results Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening identified multiple host factors critical for EHV-1 replication. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were involved in key cellular signaling and regulatory networks associated with viral infection. Functional validation demonstrated that knockout of selected host genes significantly suppressed EHV-1 replication and viral protein synthesis. Discussion These findings highlight essential host determinants required for EHV-1 replication and suggest that targeting host factors may represent a promising strategy for antiviral intervention. This study provides a foundation for the development of host-directed immunotherapeutic and antiviral approaches against EHV-1 infection.",

    "Abstract": "Air-sea fluxes have rarely or never been estimated from in situ observations in many parts of the global oceans, especially in the Arctic, despite their critical roles in weather and climate. In consequence, their reproductions by numerical models have seldomly been validated against observations. In this study, observations from Saildrone Explorer uncrewed surface vehicles are used to validate surface sensible and latent heat fluxes from GFS deterministic forecasts and GEFS ensemble forecasts in the Arctic during May – October 2019. The most striking result from this study is the low biases in sea surface temperature (SST) in the initial conditions of both the deterministic and ensemble forecasts. Excessively cold predictions of SST lead to reversed signs in air-sea differences in temperature and humidity in comparison to the observations. Consequently, surface sensible and latent heat fluxes in the forecast can be negative (from air into the water), while observed fluxes are positive. The larger SST biases at the initial time og the GEFS ensemble forecasts is the main reason for their underperformance in comparison to the GFS deterministic forecasts. The results clearly demonstrate the vital step of improving forecasts in the Arctic is to prepare for accurate initial conditions of SST.",

    "Abstract": "Focusing water waves is a potential technology improving the power generation of wave energy converters. Two semi-ellipsoidal reflectors, including long-axis opening and short-axis opening, were adopted to investigate the water-wave focusing effects. A 3D numerical wave tank was built and solved using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. First, the wave fields around the reflectors against different wave periods were calculated. Furthermore, the wave elevation at monitoring locations of the reflectors against different wave steepness was investigated. Results demonstrate that the number of focusing points of the long-axis opening is more than that of the short-axis opening for short wave periods. The locations of focusing points move with the change of wave periods. However, for long wave periods, the waves can be focused over a large area in front of the reflector. The wave height at the focusing area overall becomes smaller with the increase in the wave periods. Additionally, the wave steepness has insignificant effects on the dimensionless wave height.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction The study on the use of deep learning in pattern recognition of gunshot wounds (GSW) represents a novelty in the field of forensic pathology. Although artificial intelligence (AI) has already revolutionized many medical specialties, applications in forensic medicine are still limited. Nevertheless, AI-based tools could be of great use in a discipline that relies heavily on visual analysis. Scant scientific evidence from recent experimental studies has demonstrated the AI potential in predicting shooting distance based on GSW pictures. Previous approaches achieved a classification accuracy of 98%; however, further studies are needed to evaluate its applicability in forensic practice. The aim of this project is to further explore the application of deep learning techniques for the classification of GSWs. Materials and methods The study, conducted at the University of Catania, employed the free software Lobe AI. It was necessary to proceed through 4 consecutive phases: training, model validation, testing, and data analysis. Four study categories were then identified: GSWs, entrance/exit wounds, wounds based on the pathological range of fire, and wounds based on the type of weapon ammunition. For the software training, educational images were extracted from a forensic atlas specializing in GSWs. For the testing phase, photos from the Catania forensic case history and photos of healthy skin as a control were selected. For each study category, two phases were adopted, characterized by an increasing number of files used for training. Finally, data were recorded and subjected to statistical analysis based on the following parameters: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity. Results Encouraging data have been observed, especially when compared with available scientific evidence. Numerous parameters were shown to be above the threshold attributed to the human limit, and in some fields, the highest predictive values to date were recorded. Discussion Among the intrinsic limitations of the study, the limited data available emerged, especially for the algorithm training phase; moreover, it will be vital to proceed with the development of a specific software pre-trained on the basis of natural elements and secondarily directed to the recognition of the typical forensic characteristics. Among the strengths, however, it is possible to include the number of categories analyzed and the unprecedented use of an “intact skin” control category. In conclusion, the extension of the project to various research centers and the increase in the size of the sample adopted will allow the elimination of the emerged biases. This pilot study lays the groundwork for future multicenter research aimed at developing a robust and generalizable forensic AI model.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study aimed to evaluate the predictive efficacy of the Naples prognosis score (NPS) in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) and explore its mechanistic link to renal injury, with the goal of providing a novel clinical tool for early SA-AKI risk assessment. Methods One-way ANOVA was applied to variables exhibiting normal distribution and homo-geneous variance. Spearman analysis was performed to assess relationships. Non-normal distribution variables were analyzed using the rank sum test. Binary and ordered logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate independent relationships with SA-AKI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was employed to determine diagnostic accuracy. The survival curve was plotted by Kaplan Meier. Results The NPS score was significantly higher in the SA-AKI group than in the non-AKI group ( P &amp;lt; 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that NPS was an independent predictor of SA-AKI (OR = 11.777, P &amp;lt; 0.001), with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.855. Correlation analysis indicated positive associations of NPS with renal injury markers (urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, cystatin C) and negative associations with platelet count and low-density lipoprotein. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that NPS effectively predicted SA-AKI regardless of vasopressor use or continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), with AUC values of 0.898 in the vasopressor group and 0.866 in the non-CRRT group. Conclusion Naples prognosis score serves as an independent predictor of SA-AKI, integrating inflammatory, nutritional, and metabolic markers to provide new insights into SA-AKI pathophysiology. Clinically, NPS offers a simple and feasible tool for early identification of high-risk SA-AKI patients, guiding personalized treatment strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study aimed to further investigate the correlation between C-X-C motif chemokine 8‌ (CXCL8) and the prognosis of bacterial upper respiratory tract infections (BURTIs) in the elderly population (≥65 years) and to evaluate its potential as a clinical biomarker in this specific high-risk cohort. Methods A total of 58 elderly patients with BURTIs admitted to our hospital between January 2023 and June 2023 (observation group) and 42 healthy individuals (control group) who underwent physical examinations concurrently were selected as the research subjects. Peripheral blood CXCL8 levels were measured in both the observation and control groups at admission and reassessed in the observation group after treatment to determine differences in CXCL8 between groups and changes in CXCL8 before and after treatment in the observation group. The correlation of CXCL8 with BURTI clinical effectiveness was analyzed. Subsequently, BURTI patients were followed up for 1 year, and the effect of post-treatment CXCL8 expression on the prognostic recurrence of BURTIs was evaluated. Results The CXCL8 in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (89.67 ± 8.33 pg./mL vs. 71.20 ± 10.88 pg./mL) and decreased after treatment ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). Patients with recurrence showed higher CXCL8 levels than those without (78.44 ± 8.84 pg./mL vs. 69.67 ± 5.51 pg./mL, p &amp;lt; 0.05). According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, CXCL8 exhibited excellent effects on the occurrence and prognostic recurrence of BURTIs (AUC = 0.788). Conclusion CXCL8 is elevated in elderly patients with BURTIs, demonstrating good evaluation effects on the occurrence and prognostic recurrence of BURTIs. However, these findings position CXCL8 as a promising biomarker for guiding personalized treatment in elderly BURTI patients, though further validation and integration with clinical scores are needed to improve risk stratification.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Female fertility preservation (FFP) has become a clinical priority because gonadotoxic therapies for cancer and benign diseases are increasingly common and may cause irreversible ovarian failure. The current clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on fertility assessment, oocyte/embryo cryopreservation, and ovarian tissue cryopreservation and transplantation for women at risk of iatrogenic infertility. Methods This guideline was developed in accordance with the WHO Handbook for Guideline Development. A multidisciplinary Guideline Development Group (GDG) formulated nine key clinical questions in the field of FFP, and Cochrane-standard systematic reviews were conducted for each question. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach, with critical outcomes including live birth, clinical pregnancy, time to pregnancy, treatment-related delays in oncotherapy, and severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Recommendations were formulated by the GDG through the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision framework. Results and discussion The GDG agreed on nine recommendations tailored to the Chinese clinical practice environment. When cancer treatment must start within two weeks, a random-start stimulation protocol is conditionally endorsed; pooled data show only one extra mature oocyte, but the time saved outweighs the marginal gonadotrophin increase. Letrozole co-administration is strongly recommended because it restrains oestradiol without reducing yield and may lessen OHSS risk in hormone-sensitive tumours. For ovarian tissue cryopreservation, slow freezing and vitrification are deemed equivalent in the absence of comparative trials; institutional capacity dictates the choice. Concurrent GnRH-agonist during chemotherapy is strongly advised across seventeen RCTs and improves subsequent live birth. Oocyte cryopreservation is weakly preferred to tissue for sexually mature women on the basis of higher cumulative pregnancy and lower morbidity, while ovarian tissue cryopreservation remains the default when stimulation is impossible. Baseline fertility evaluation should combine age, AMH and AFC; no single marker is superior, yet together they refine counselling. Orthotopic transplantation is strongly favoured over heterotopic grafting because published live births are almost exclusively pelvic. Finally, ovarian cortical fragments should undergo routine histopathology, augmented—according to metastatic risk—by immunohistochemistry, PCR or murine xenograft; tissue harbouring malignant cells is usually withheld from re-implantation.",

    "Abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA), a chronic degenerative joint disease, arises from a confluence of factors including aging, mechanical injury, and obesity. Autophagy, a fundamental cellular process involving the degradation and recycling of cellular components, plays a critical role in chondrocyte homeostasis and survival under stress. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), a diverse class of RNA molecules with no protein-coding potential, exert significant influence on gene expression through post-transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms. Growing evidence suggests a crucial interplay between ncRNAs, autophagy, and OA pathogenesis. This review summarizes the multifaceted role of autophagy in OA chondrocytes and delves into the regulatory mechanisms of ncRNAs on OA-associated autophagy, aiming to elucidate the intricate pathological network underlying OA development and identify novel therapeutic targets.",

    "Abstract": "Background Previous studies have shown that complement activation is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on dialysis. This study aims to investigate the relationship between complement 3 (C3) and vascular calcification (VC) in non-dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) patients. Methods Four hundred and fifty six NDD-CKD patients were enrolled from 2019 to 2022. C3 was measured by immunoscattering turbidimetry. According to the results of CT imaging, the patients were divided into the aorta vascular calcification group and the non-aortic vascular calcification group. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis and logistic regression model were used to explore the association between C3 and VC in NDD-CKD patients. To assess how it predicted, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was undertaken. Results In NDD-CKD patients, the third tertile of C3 (0.95–1.63 g/L) was significantly correlated with VC (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.13–3.83, p = 0.020). Older age and history of underlying diseases (hypertension, hyperlipidemia) are independent risk factors for VC in NDD-CKD patients. The area under the curve (AUC) of C3 for predicting VC was 0.849 g/L (sensitivity, 79.4%; specificity, 76.7%). Conclusion In patients with NDD-CKD, serum complement C3 exhibits a J-shaped relationship with vascular calcification, indicating a complex, non-linear association. Additionally, older age, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were confirmed as independent risk factors.",

    "Abstract": "Background and aims Numerous risk-prediction models for hepatic encephalopathy (HE) after TIPS have been proposed, but their quality, discrimination, and clinical utility remain uncertain. We aimed to identify key predictors of post-TIPS HE and to critically appraise existing models. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies (inception 15 July 2025) from Chinese (VIP, Wanfang, CNKI, and CBM) and international (Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library) databases. Model quality and bias were assessed via PROBAST. Pooled AUCs and predictor effect sizes were calculated using STATA 15.0 and MedCalc. Results A total of 24 studies (5,197 patients) yielded 32 unique models; the incidence of HE ranged from 19.9 to 46.6%. Discrimination was generally good (AUC range, 0.64–1.00; 30 models &amp;gt;0.70; 22 &amp;gt; 0.80). PROBAST flagged high bias—especially in model analysis. A meta-analysis produced a summary AUC of 0.815 (95%CI, 0.780–0.849). Consistent predictors ( p &amp;lt; 0.01) included older age, diabetes, higher Child-Pugh score/class, elevated ammonia, and increased portal-to-splenic vein diameter ratio. Conclusion Existing post-TIPS HE models demonstrate strong discrimination but suffer methodological limitations and bias. Future studies should employ multicenter cohorts, harmonized definitions, rigorous analytics, and external validation to yield robust, clinically actionable tools.

    "Abstract": "Background This study aimed to evaluate the distribution of relative peripheral refraction (RPR) and its relationship with ocular biometry in Chinese children of different refractive statuses. Methods This study included 309 participants aged 4 to 14 years who were divided into three groups based on refraction: hyperopia, emmetropia, and myopia. IOLMaster 700 was used to acquire ocular biometry data, and RPR was measured using multispectral refraction topography. Refraction difference values (RDVs) were used to describe the RPR and included the total defocus (TRDV), defocus at 0° to 15° (RDV15), 15° to 30° (RDV15–30), 30° to 45° (RDV30–45), and 45° to 53° (RDV45–53) eccentricities, and superior (RDV-S), inferior (RDV-I), temporal (RDV-T), and nasal (RDV-N) quadrants. Results In participants with emmetropia and myopia, RPR values became more positive as the distance from the foveal pit increased, whereas hyperopic participants showed a decrease in relative hyperopic defocus in the RDV45–53. Beyond 30° eccentricity, there were significant differences between the refractive groups; those with emmetropia and myopia had significantly higher RPR values than those with hyperopia. The spherical equivalent was negatively correlated with RDV-T ( β = −0.31, p &amp;lt; 0.01) and TRDV ( β = −0.26, p &amp;lt; 0.01). In myopic children, the correlation extended to multiple peripheral regions with increasing degrees of myopia. The ocular parameter most strongly associated with RDV45–53 was the axial length/corneal radius of curvature (AL/R, β = 0.48, p &amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusion In emmetropic and myopic children, RPR values became progressively positive with greater eccentricity, indicating a relative peripheral hyperopic shift. In contrast, hyperopic children showed a reduction in the RPR beyond 30° eccentricity. The spherical equivalent was negatively correlated with temporal and total RPR, and AL/R showed the strongest association with far peripheral RPR.",

    "Abstract": "Background Teledermatology has expanded markedly in the post-pandemic era; however, its impact on the histopathologic presentation of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) remains insufficiently characterized. Tumor depth and histologic subtype are key prognostic factors and may differ according to diagnostic pathway. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational study at a tertiary referral hospital in southern Europe, including all histologically confirmed BCCs diagnosed in 2019 through face-to-face dermatology and in 2022 through teledermatology. A total of 486 tumors were analyzed (201 face-to-face; 285 teledermatology). Histologic subtypes (superficial, nodular, micronodular, sclerodermiform) were examined individually and grouped into non-aggressive (superficial/nodular) versus aggressive (micronodular/sclerodermiform) categories. Statistical analyses included Welch’s t -test, chi-square tests, and multivariable logistic regression. Results Mean tumor depth was significantly lower in the teledermatology cohort (1.67 mm vs. 2.51 mm; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Histologic subtype distribution differed between pathways (χ 2 = 41.3; p = 0.002): superficial BCCs were more frequent in face-to-face consultations (15.9% vs. 8.8%), whereas nodular and micronodular variants predominated in the teledermatology group (65.6% vs. 62.2 and 13.3% vs. 4.0%, respectively). Sclerodermiform tumors were slightly more common in face-to-face evaluations (17.9% vs. 12.3%). When regrouped into non-aggressive versus aggressive patterns, the distribution differed between pathways, although this categorization did not indicate a predominance of low-risk histology in the teledermatology cohort. In multivariable analysis, tumor depth was the only independent predictor of consultation pathway ( β = −1.10; p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion Teledermatology was associated with the diagnosis of significantly shallower BCCs, even across subtypes, supporting its role in facilitating earlier histologic detection. Subtype differences were pathway-specific but did not fully account for the depth disparity. These findings highlight teledermatology as an effective diagnostic route for timely identification of BCC in contemporary clinical practice.",

All had normal or near-normal standard biochemistry results, except for increased levels of procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the absence of any infectious source: PCT: 41, 5.8, and 1.2 ng/mL, respectively (normal range &amp;lt; 0.05 ng/mL) and CRP: 127, 21, and 14 mg/L, respectively (normal range: 0–5 mg/L). Right hepatectomy with negative surgical margins resulted in the eventual normalization of CRP levels in all patients, and PCT levels normalized in the latter two patients. The PCT level was 0.07 ng/mL at 3 months in the first patient. The emergence of two bone metastases in the rib and right femur at 7 months was accompanied by an increase in PCT levels to 0.8 ng/mL. Radiotherapy provided transient control in the femur only. Consequently, a thoracic wall resection was performed, followed by a segmental resection of the femur. Treatment with bevacizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day and atezolizumab at 1200 mg/day every 21 days was started. A PET-CT scan conducted at the 42nd month showed no signs of recurrence, and the PCT level was 0.04 ng/mL. The other patients exhibited normal PCT levels and no evidence of recurrence at 16- and 6-months post-treatment. Since PCT measurement is routinely available, baseline levels should be measured at least once during the workup of patients with fHCC.",

    "Abstract": "Bronchobiliary fistula (BBF) is an exceptionally rare and complex clinical entity that involves abnormal communication between the biliary system and the bronchial tree. This article presents the first reported case of BBF successfully occluded with percutaneous microwave ablation (PMWA). A 35-years-old female with primary colon cancer developed BBF after PMWA for liver metastasis and presented with bilioptysis that persisted despite conventional antibiotic therapy and drainage. Under computed tomography (CT) guidance, targeted PMWA with an ablation power of 40 w was applied to the fistula tract for 7 min, resulting in complete radiographic closure and resolution of symptoms. Compared with traditional surgical, endoscopic, or drainage-based approaches, PMWA represents a minimally invasive alternative. While this technique has significant advantages in terms of precision, quick recovery, and applicability to high-risk patients, its efficacy may be limited in patients with large or anatomically complex fistulas. Further clinical validation is needed to establish long-term outcomes and refine technical parameters. This case supports PMWA as a promising therapeutic option for BBF and highlights its potential in fistula management.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigated the antiretroviral efficacy, toxicity profile, and cellular uptake of phosphothioate (PS) and PS/LNA-modified oligonucleotides within an in vitro HIV infection model. Phosphothioate (PS) oligonucleotides, designed to bind conserved regions of the HIV-1 genome, were modified at the 3’ and/or 5’ ends with LNA nucleotides. The antiviral properties of oligonucleotides against HIV-1 subtype A6 were evaluated using human MT-4 cell cultures. The antiretroviral activity of LNA-oligonucleotides against HIV-1 has been established. Variations in the 50% inhibitory viral reproductive dose (IC50) values among the oligonucleotides were observed, depending upon both the target and the incorporated LNA modification. Optimal IC50 values (90 ± 10 nM) were achieved using a PS oligonucleotide lacking LNA modifications, which targeted the HIV-1 integrase-encoding genomic region. Optimal HIV inhibitory action among LNA constructs was observed in an oligonucleotide with a 5’-end LNA modification targeting the HIV integrase region (IC50 = 1.12 ± 0.03 μM). The introduction of LNA modifications to PS oligonucleotides failed to enhance antiviral activity, as demonstrated by IC50 values revealing significant in vitro HIV-1 inhibitory capacity. The internalization of oligonucleotides demonstrating optimal IC50 values was investigated via flow cytometry and imaging techniques. Antisense oligonucleotides with single PS modification showed better antiretroviral activity with lower IC50 value compared to PS/LNA-modified antisense oligonucleotides. The reason for this difference is the better internalization ability of PS-modified oligonucleotides. The characteristic features included low toxicity (maintaining &amp;gt;92% viable cells after 48 h of culture), high cytoplasmic membrane sorption capacity (approximately 12% FAM + cells after 48 h), high penetration efficiency (approximately 98% FAM + cells showing cytoplasmic signal), and elevated internalization and entropy ratios.",

    "Abstract": "Background “Tubeless” anesthesia for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) maintains spontaneous ventilation but complicates respiratory monitoring. The integrated pulmonary index (IPI) is a non-invasive tool that assesses respiratory status by integrating four real-time parameters [EtCO 2 , respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), and SpO 2 ] into a single score ranging from 1 to 10. Case presentation We present a 42-years-old female who underwent right middle lobectomy under tubeless anesthesia with continuous IPI monitoring. Anesthesia was maintained via laryngeal mask airway with spontaneous ventilation, supplemented by total intravenous anesthesia and paravertebral blockade. The IPI system facilitated tiered respiratory management: IPI ≤ 6 signaled acute respiratory events, while IPI ≤ 4 necessitated immediate assisted ventilation intervention. Real-time IPI tracking ensured respiratory stability (target range 8–10, EtCO 2 35–45 mmHg) while promptly identifying deterioration. Postoperative arterial blood gases (PaCO 2 42 mmHg, pH 7.33) validated optimal ventilation management. Conclusion This case demonstrates IPI’s efficacy in detecting early ventilatory compromise during tubeless VATS, enabling proactive intervention without compromising surgical advantages. Further refinement of IPI thresholds may enhance perioperative safety in spontaneous ventilation anesthesia.",

    "Abstract": "Background Long COVID is a complex condition characterized by persistent symptoms such as chronic fatigue, cognitive impairment, and autonomic dysfunction. Emerging evidence suggests that the gut may play a role in the pathophysiology of long COVID, potentially contributing to systemic inflammation and symptom severity. Prior studies indicate intestinal permeability (IP) alteration in patients with long COVID. To date, there have been no reports on the assessment of intestinal permeability via carbohydrate absorption in individuals with long COVID. Case presentation We present a 60-year-old female with long COVID who exhibited chronic fatigue and autonomic dysfunction for more than 3 years following SARS-CoV-2 infection. IP was assessed at five time points using a carbohydrate absorption test. Results revealed significantly elevated lactulose/mannitol (L/M) ratios during episodes of symptom exacerbation, including a second SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, clinically observed improvement in fatigue correlated with a reduction in IP. A probiotic regimen with Bacillus coagulans and Bacillus subtilis , combined with a second intervention using medicinal clay, led to further clinical improvement. Conclusions This case report demonstrates a correlation between intestinal permeability alterations and long COVID symptom severity. Notably, to our knowledge, this is the first report assessing intestinal permeability in a long COVID patient using a carbohydrate absorption–based permeability test. It reinforces the emerging link between gut barrier integrity and long COVID pathophysiology and emphasizes the need for further studies to assess IP as a potential disease marker. Furthermore, the observed improvement with probiotic therapy highlights the need for further research into microbiome-targeted interventions for long COVID management. Larger studies are required to explore the mechanistic link between gut permeability and long COVID pathophysiology.",

    "Abstract": "Background Xerostomia is a common adverse effect of radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancers, leading to significant impairment of oral health and overall quality of life. Evidence-based guidelines for managing radiation-induced xerostomia remain limited, and the majority of available options provide only temporary symptomatic relief. In Ayurveda, this condition is described under mukharoga (oral diseases). Objectives The objective of the study was to evaluate the combined effect of Drakshaguduchyadi Kavala (gargling) and Khadiradi Vati lozenges on symptoms of radiotherapy-induced xerostomia using subjective questionnaires, sialometry, and salivary pH measurements. Materials and methods A total of 20 patients were enrolled with clinically diagnosed radiotherapy-induced xerostomia. Subjective outcomes were assessed using a xerostomia questionnaire and analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Objective outcomes, including unstimulated salivary flow, stimulated salivary flow, and salivary pH, were evaluated using sialometry and analyzed using the paired t -test. Patients received Khadiradi Vati lozenges followed by Drakshaguduchyadi Kavala (gargling) three times daily for 30 days. Results After 30 days of intervention, significant improvement was observed in multiple subjective symptoms, including oral dryness, chewing and swallowing difficulty, choking sensation, sticky saliva, impaired enjoyment of food, and difficulty in speech. Objective parameters—unstimulated and stimulated sialometry values and salivary pH—also exhibited statistically significant improvement. Conclusion Drakshaguduchyadi Kavala (gargling) and Khadiradi Vati lozenges can be considered as a treatment option in radiotherapy-induced xerostomia.

    "Abstract": "Objective This study aimed to provide a clinical reference for prenatal diagnosis by summarizing the ultrasound manifestations and classifications of fetal limb–body wall complex (LBWC). Methods We retrospectively reviewed cases of LBWC diagnosed through prenatal ultrasound examination at Peking Union Medical College Hospital and Xuzhou Maternal and Child Health Hospital between 2012 and 2023. The primary prenatal ultrasound imaging features and associated malformations were recorded and classified into two categories based on the presence (type I) or absence (type II) of craniofacial anomalies. Results Among 37 fetuses with LBWC, 4 were classified as type I, 31 were classified as type II, and 2 exhibited features of both type I and type II concurrently. All fetuses had varying degrees of thoracoschisis or gastroschisis with visceral herniation. A total of 35 fetuses had limb abnormalities, and 11 had craniofacial abnormalities. All fetuses showed varying degrees of spinal curvature, and 23 had umbilical cord abnormalities. In addition, 32 fetuses had other abnormalities, including a persistent extraembryonic coelom in 12 fetuses, an amniotic band in 9 fetuses, nuchal translucency thickening in 5 fetuses, nuchal cystic hygroma in 3 fetuses, an invisible bladder in 2 fetuses, and external genital anomalies in 1 fetus. All cases resulted in induced termination. Conclusion Fetal LBWC has characteristic ultrasonographic features and can be diagnosed in the first trimester. An accurate prenatal ultrasound assessment is essential to enable clinicians to offer future parents the necessary information and counseling concerning the prognosis of this type of anomaly.",

    "Abstract": "Background Acute esophagogastric variceal bleeding (EGVB) is a lethal complication in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicated by portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). While transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a standard treatment for portal hypertension, it is often contraindicated or technically challenging in patients with extensive main portal vein occlusion (Vp4 type) or severe hepatic dysfunction. Case summary We report the first clinical application of a novel salvage technique, percutaneous portal-central venous bypass (PPCV), in a 56-year-old man with HCC, decompensated cirrhosis, and extensive PVTT. The patient presented with life-threatening EGVB refractory to endoscopic therapy and was deemed ineligible for TIPS due to the extent of the tumor thrombus and critical instability. PPCV was performed by percutaneously puncturing the portal vein under ultrasound guidance and establishing an extracorporeal shunt connected to a pre-existing subclavian central venous catheter. Results The procedure was technically successful and achieved immediate hemodynamic improvement. Direct portal venous pressure decreased significantly from 40.6 mmHg pre-connection to 18.8 mmHg post-connection. Clinical hemostasis was achieved within 24 h, and the patient remained stable for 2 weeks until discharge. Although the patient succumbed to tumor progression 2 months later, no recurrent bleeding or procedure-related complications were observed. Conclusion PPCV is a simple, feasible, and effective salvage therapy for rapidly reducing portal pressure and controlling refractory bleeding. It provides a vital therapeutic option for high-risk HCC patients with PVTT who are contraindicated for TIPS.",

    "Abstract": "This case report evaluates a novel multi-sensory integration training (MSIT) protocol, combining binocular disparate vision perception training with physiotherapeutic scoliosis-specific exercises in two pediatric patients (aged 4 and 5 years) with comorbid non-syndromic strabismus and idiopathic scoliosis. Both patients presented with intermittent exotropia, amblyopia, and thoracic scoliosis (Cobb angles of 10° and 13°, respectively). Following the individualized MSIT intervention, marked improvements were observed in both visual and spinal parameters: visual acuity of the amblyopic eye improved, exotropia magnitude decreased, stereopsis recovered, and Cobb angles substantially reduced to 3° and 0°, respectively, after 3 months. A transient “treatment plateau” in perceptual eye position metrics was observed in one case before subsequent normalization. These findings suggest that MSIT, by simultaneously addressing aberrant visual and proprioceptive inputs, effectively improves both visual function and spinal alignment in this comorbid population, potentially through promoting central nervous system recalibration of multi-sensory integration for postural control. This integrated approach highlights the importance of interdisciplinary management for children presenting with both strabismus and spinal deformities.",

    "Abstract": "Background Chronic non-specific low back pain (CLBP) imposes a substantial healthcare burden. For CLBP, non-pharmacologic pain management within physical therapy/rehabilitation commonly relies on therapeutic exercise (exercise therapy). Aquatic interventions such as exercise and balneotherapy are widely prescribed to treat CLBP, but their comparative effectiveness against land-based exercise, and multi-model programs remain unclear. We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to compare the effects of aquatic, land-based exercise, and multi-modal interventions on pain and disability in patients with chronic low back pain. Methods We searched from inception to May 2025 for randomized controlled trials in adults with chronic non-specific low back pain that evaluated water-based therapies (aquatic exercise, hydrotherapy/balneotherapy). All randomized arms within eligible trials were retained, allowing comparisons with land-based exercise, combined aquatic + land-based programs, and general care/blank control. Results We included 26 RCTs, forming a 9-node network (blank control, general care, land-based exercise, aquatic exercise, balneotherapy, and their combinations with general care/land-based exercise). For pain intensity, compared with blank control, balneotherapy + general care (SMD = 2.51, 95% CI 1.26–3.76; p &amp;lt; 0.001), aquatic exercise + general care (SMD = 1.96, 95% CI 0.44–3.48; p = 0.011), balneotherapy + land-based exercise (SMD = 1.68, 95% CI 0.58–2.78; p = 0.003), aquatic exercise (SMD = 1.58, 95% CI 0.83–2.32; p &amp;lt; 0.001), land-based exercise (SMD = 1.45, 95% CI 0.56–2.34; p = 0.001), and balneotherapy (SMD = 1.27, 95% CI 0.19–2.35; p = 0.021) significantly reduced pain. By contrast, land-based exercise + general care (SMD = 1.55, 95% CI − 0.18–3.27; p = 0.078) and general care (SMD = 1.02, 95% CI − 0.13–2.17; p = 0.081) did not reach statistical significance. Based on SUCRA for pain, balneotherapy + general care ranked first (SUCRA = 0.92; PrBest = 61.4%; mean rank = 1.7), followed by aquatic exercise + general care (0.71; 21.5%; 3.3) and balneotherapy + land-based exercise (0.62; 3.8%; 4.0), with combined interventions generally ranking above single modalities; blank control ranked last (0.01; 0.0%; 8.9). For clinical context, the observed SMDs correspond approximately to 24–48 points of pain reduction across the interventions that showed statistically significant effects. For disability, compared with blank control, balneotherapy + general care (SMD = 2.76, 95% CI 1.12–4.40; p = 0.001), balneotherapy (SMD = 2.48, 95% CI 0.50–4.45; p = 0.014), aquatic exercise + general care (SMD = 2.28, 95% CI 0.69–3.86; p = 0.005), balneotherapy + land-based exercise (SMD = 2.06, 95% CI 0.64–3.48; p = 0.004), aquatic exercise (SMD = 2.03, 95% CI 1.20–2.87; p &amp;lt; 0.001), land-based exercise (SMD = 1.84, 95% CI 0.80–2.88; p = 0.001), and general care (SMD = 1.66, 95% CI 0.11–3.21; p = 0.035) significantly reduced disability, whereas land-based exercise + general care did not (SMD = 1.72, 95% CI − 0.25–3.68; p = 0.086). SUCRA rankings for disability again favored multimodal care: balneotherapy + general care ranked first (SUCRA = 0.83; PrBest = 44.6%; mean rank = 2.4), followed by balneotherapy (0.71; 29.3%; 3.3) and aquatic exercise + general care (0.64; 16.9%; 3.9), with blank control consistently last (0.01; 0.0%; 8.9). Given very high heterogeneity and low-to-very-low certainty for most comparisons, these findings should be interpreted as preliminary directional evidence rather than actionable treatment recommendations. Results suggest multimodal approaches warrant investigation in future rigorously conducted trials. Conclusion In CLBP, multimodal programs that integrate hydrotherapeutic components with general care or exercise tended to provide greater improvements than single interventions for both pain and disability. Among single modalities, effects were outcome-specific: for pain, aquatic exercise performed best and land-based exercise generally exceeded balneotherapy; for disability, balneotherapy and aquatic exercise showed larger improvements than land-based exercise. Land-based exercise remains a beneficial and pragmatic option where aquatic access is limited, while adding general care to land-based exercise did not show a consistent additional benefit. This analysis is substantially limited by very high heterogeneity ( I 2 &amp;gt; 85%) and predominantly very low certainty evidence. Of the 36 comparisons assessed for pain intensity, 94.4% (34/36) were rated low to very low certainty; for disability, all 36 comparisons were rated very low certainty. These evidence quality profiles severely restrict ranking reliability and recommendation strength. Systematic review registration Registered on PROSPERO. Unique Identifier: CRD42023432018.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aimed to evaluate the effects of low-molecular-weight hyaluronic acid (LMWHA) solution and high-concentration oxygen (HCO) through a specific medical device (Caress Flow©), compared to topical administration of hyaluronic acid (HA) alone, on symptoms of mild and moderate stress and mixed urinary incontinence in women with genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Methods A total of 68 postmenopausal women were registered (from October 2021 to September 2023). Patients were divided into two groups: one group received therapy with LMWHA solution and HCO combined, and the second group received HA therapy alone. The primary outcome was the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I). Secondary outcomes included the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire–short form (ICIQ-SF) questionnaire and the International Quality of Life (IQoL) questionnaire. Results Of the 68 women, 35 (51%) and 33 (49%) were treated with LMWHA solution and HCO combined and HA alone for 10 weeks, respectively. A total of 28 (80%) vs. 7 (21%) women reported an improvement (PGI-I score ≤3) of the symptoms in the LMWHA solution and HCO combined group vs. the HA alone group. According to the ICIQ-SF, a statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups after treatment (median, 7 [5–11] vs. 10 [8–11]; p = 0.03). The IQoL questionnaire recorded a statistically significantly lower median score in the LMWHA solution and HCO combined group compared with the HA group, before (71 [IQR 55–81] vs. 89 [IQR 67–94]; p &amp;lt; 0.01) and after (78 [IQR 65–86] vs. 88 [IQR 72–99]; p = 0.04) treatment. Conclusion LMWHA solution and HCO combined might improve mild and moderate stress and mixed urinary incontinence in women with GSM and appear superior to HA therapy alone. However, these results need to be confirmed in further studies with a controlled design and a larger population.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional clinical medical internship models often lack structured educational objectives and comprehensive assessments, limiting holistic competency development. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a novel internship education management model integrating Bloom's Taxonomy with a student-mentor rotation system to enhance cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 54 optometry interns during their ophthalmology clinical rotation, assigning them to either an experimental group ( n = 30) using the Bloom's Taxonomy-integrated rotation model or a control group ( n = 24) receiving traditional training. Both groups completed 12-week rotations with identical duration and content. The Bloom's Taxonomy-integrated rotation model was organized into three progressive phases corresponding to ascending levels of Bloom's Taxonomy (knowledge acquisition → clinical application → synthesis). Outcomes were assessed through written examinations, practical skill test, and course experience questionnaires. The Bloom's Taxonomy-integrated rotation group showed superior performance in case analysis, history taking and practical skills. They also reported significantly higher satisfaction in problem-solving, motivation and feedback quality. In conclusion, the Bloom's Taxonomy-integrated rotation model demonstrated superior clinical reasoning, practical skills, and medical interns' satisfaction, among optometry interns compared to traditional training. The Bloom's Taxonomy-integrated rotation model represents an effective, structured framework for enhancing medical internship training, though warranting further validation in broader settings.",

    "Abstract": "Background Diabetic nephropathy (DN) remains a global health burden. This study integrates multiple approaches to investigate the therapeutic effects of Hydroxysafflor Yellow A (HSYA) in DN. Methods SwissTargetPrediction and PharmMapper were used to predict HSYA targets. GeneCards and OMIM databases were used to identify targets associated with DN. The STRING database was used to construct the protein–protein interaction (PPI) network of key targets, and Cytoscape was applied to identify the core targets within the PPI network. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses of key targets were performed using the Metascape database. Molecular docking analyses of HSYA with core targets were performed using AutoDock Vina. The DN model was established using db/db mice fed a normal diet, with db/m mice serving as controls. Renal fibrosis was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and qPCR detected core targets and key signaling pathways. Results We identified 236 key targets. GO and KEGG analyses were significantly enriched in the PI3K-Akt, Ras, AGE-RAGE, FoxO, mTOR, and autophagy signaling pathways. HSYA exhibited strong binding affinity with AKT1, PI3K, and mTOR. In vivo studies showed that HSYA modulated the expression of autophagy-related genes (PI3K, AKT, mTOR) and alleviated renal fibrosis in DN mice. Conclusion This study provides preliminary evidence that HSYA may alleviate DN by improving renal fibrosis and modulating autophagy, thereby establishing a theoretical basis for its development as a potential therapeutic agent.",

    "Abstract": "Aim This study aims to report the successful conservative management of herpes simplex keratitis (HSK) complicated by corneal perforation and anterior chamber collapse, emphasizing the importance of accurate diagnosis and close clinical monitoring to avoid surgical intervention. Methods A 54-year-old male patient with recurrent redness and pain in the left eye was referred for potential surgical intervention due to corneal perforation and anterior chamber collapse. Examination revealed central corneal infiltrates, a positive Seidel test, and anterior chamber collapse. A tear specimen was collected for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to detect viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), human adenovirus (HAdV), and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Results PCR testing confirmed herpes simplex virus infection in this patient. Treatment with oral valacyclovir, topical ofloxacin ointment, and 0.1% fluorometholone eye drops resulted in significant clinical improvement. Over the course of 1 month, visual acuity improved from counting fingers at 80 cm to 20/30, corneal lesions healed, and the anterior chamber reformed without the need for surgical intervention. Conclusion This case demonstrates that conservative management can be effective for HSK with corneal perforation and anterior chamber collapse, particularly when supported by accurate diagnosis and close clinical monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Esophageal cancer remains a major global health burden and is among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Accurate evaluation of tumor regression grade (TRG) after neoadjuvant therapy is essential for assessing treatment response and guiding postoperative management. However, conventional TRG assessment relies heavily on subjective histopathological assessments, leading to considerable inter-observer variability and limited reproducibility. We aimed to develop an objective and automated TRG assessment framework using artificial intelligence for digital pathology. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 157 patients with esophageal cancer and 1,298 hematoxylin and eosin-stained whole-slide images. Three slide-level pathology foundation models and three multiple instance learning methods were evaluated within a patient-level multiple instance learning framework, enabling weakly supervised TRG prediction based solely on patient-level labels. Results The proposed framework achieved a classification accuracy of 82.7% and demonstrated strong agreement with manual pathologist grading. Notably, artificial intelligence-derived TRG score provided superior prognostic stratification compared with conventional assessments, showing significant associations with progression-free and overall survival. Discussion This study presents a foundation-model-driven, patient-level multiple instance learning framework for automated evaluation of TRG in esophageal cancer. This approach offers a standardized, reproducible, and clinically interpretable solution that reduces the workload of pathologists and improves prognostic precision. These findings highlight the potential of weakly supervised AI pathology in advancing personalized treatment assessment and decision-making in digital oncology.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Burnout is prevalent among medical students, arising from rigorous training and personal pressures. It is closely linked to stress-related and mood disorders. This study examined the prevalence of burnout among medical students at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) and explored its association with mentorship, motivation and professional values, with the aim of informing strategies for mental health and educational support. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study involved convenience sampling of 328 UKM medical students participating in UKM mentoring programmes. Structured questionnaires assessed sociodemographic characteristics, burnout (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory), mentorship experiences, motivation (Strength of Motivation for Medical School-Revised) and professional values (Physician Values in Practice Scale). Statistical analyses included Student’s t -test, chi-square test and logistic regression. Results Among 328 respondents, high personal, work-related and client-related burnout rates were 60.4, 47.3 and 32.0%, respectively. Mentor approachability in lecturer mentorship was associated with lower work-related burnout ( p &amp;lt; 0.001, OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.47–0.82). In peer mentorship, personal attributes were associated with lower personal ( p &amp;lt; 0.001, OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.25–0.66) and work-related burnout ( p = 0.013, OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52–0.93). Persistence in motivation was associated with lower work-related ( p &amp;lt; 0.001, OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.80–0.92) and client-related burnout ( p &amp;lt; 0.001, OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.77–0.87). Professional values of service were linked to reduced client-related burnout ( p = 0.009). Conclusion Interventions for burnout among medical students should focus on enhancing the quality of lecturer and peer mentorship while also strengthening students’ motivation and professional values during medical training. Mental health educators play an essential role in embedding well-being strategies within medical education to reduce burnout.",

    "Abstract": "Background Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction is a common ocular condition in early infancy and may lead to neonatal dacryocystitis or severe infection if not treated promptly. Short-video platforms such as TikTok are used by young parents to obtain health information, but the quality of related videos remains unclear. This study evaluated the quality of TikTok videos on congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction and its association with uploader type and user engagement. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional review of TikTok videos retrieved with predefined keywords. We included 108 videos, classified by uploader type, and extracted characteristics, engagement metrics, and coverage of six content domains. Two attending ophthalmologists independently rated each video using DISCERN, the Global Quality Score, and the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials. Group differences and Spearman correlations were analyzed. Results Among 108 videos, 62 (57.4%) were uploaded by medical professionals and 18 (16.7%) by non-Profit organizations, with a median duration of 48.5 s and median numbers of likes, comments, favorites and shares of 68, 8, 13, and 24, respectively. Videos uploaded by non-Profit organizations and medical professionals achieved substantially higher DISCERN scores (about 59.22 and 50.00 vs. 37.50 and 19.40), Global Quality Scores (median 4.5 and 4.0 vs. 3.0 and 1.0), and Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool for Audiovisual Materials understandability (median 92.31 and 84.62% vs. 73.08 and 53.85%) and actionability (both 75.00% vs. 66.67 and 50.00%) than those uploaded by non-Medical individuals and for-profit organizations (all P &amp;lt; 0.001). Spearman analysis found no significant correlations between overall quality scores and engagement, but duration correlated weakly with some selected quality indicators ( r = 0.17–0.21, P &amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusion TikTok videos on congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction show marked heterogeneity in content completeness and educational quality, largely determined by uploader type. Non-Profit organizations and medical professionals produce more reliable, understandable, and actionable videos, but these are not consistently more popular than lower-quality content. Clinicians and institutions should develop guideline-concordant short videos and direct parents toward trustworthy channels, while platforms consider mechanisms to highlight professionally verified pediatric eye-health information.",

    "Abstract": "Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accelerates Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology and neuroinflammation, potentially via gut-brain axis disruptions. Whether restoring gut microbial homeostasis mitigates TBI-exacerbated AD features remains unclear, particularly with respect to sex differences. Objective The goal of our study was to test whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) modifies amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, gut microbial composition, metabolites, and motor outcomes in male and female 5xFAD mice subjected to TBI. Methods Male and female 5xFAD mice received sham treatments or controlled cortical impact, followed 24 h later by vehicle (VH) or sex-matched FMT from C57BL/6 donors. Assessments at baseline, 1-, and 3-days post-injury (dpi) included Thioflavin-S and 6E10 immunostaining for Aβ, Iba-1 and GFAP for glial activation, lesion volume, rotarod performance, 16S rRNA sequencing for microbiome profiling, serum short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and gut histology. Results TBI increased cortical and dentate gyrus Aβ burden, with females showing greater vulnerability. FMT reduced Aβ deposition in sham animals and shifted plaque morphology but did not attenuate TBI-induced amyloid escalation. FMT differentially modulated glial responses by sex and region (reduced microgliosis in males) without altering lesion volume at 3 dpi. Rotarod performance was better in sham females compared to males and declined in FMT-treated TBI females. Fecal microbiome alpha diversity and richness were unchanged, while beta diversity revealed marked, time-dependent community shifts after TBI that were slightly altered by FMT. Gut morphology remained broadly intact, but crypt width increased after TBI, particularly in males. Conclusion In 5xFAD mice, TBI drives sex-dependent worsening of amyloid pathology, neuroinflammation, and dysbiosis. Acute FMT partially restores microbial composition and plaque features in sham animals but fails to reverse TBI-induced neuroinflammation or motor deficits. These findings underscore the context- and sex-dependence of microbiome interventions and support longer-term, sex-specific strategies for AD with comorbid TBI.",

    "Abstract": "There is a need for dual action anti-virulence and anti-biofilm agents that target the opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus . Previous research determined that 0.8 mg/mL 4-ethoxybenzoic acid (4EB) reduced S. aureus ATCC 6538 biofilm formation by 88% relative to untreated controls with moderate inhibition of planktonic cell growth. Here we report that 4EB impacted S. aureus virulence phenotypes across all growth phases, including alpha-hemolysin (Hla) and serine protease (SplB/C) exoprotein production (60% reduction), staphyloxanthin pigment accumulation (73% reduction) and alpha-hemolysis (&amp;gt;87% reduction) compared to untreated control cells. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that 4EB downregulated virulence gene expression, including &amp;gt;100-fold reduction of alpha-hemolysin ( hla ) and leukocidins ( lukDvEv ), and a 35-fold decrease of the response regulator SaeR. Phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) transcription by biofilm-grown cells was upregulated by 4EB more than 4-fold for α1-4 psm and β1-2 psm genes, while δ -toxin ( hld ) was unaffected. In silico molecular docking analysis revealed that 4EB has a strong binding affinity (ΔG &amp;lt; −6.0 kcal/mol) for 9 virulence-associated transcriptional regulators, including SaeS, IcaR and CodY. Analysis of gene transcription during late exponential phase growth determined that genes controlled by 7 of the 9 identified regulators were significantly impacted by 4EB. The docking analysis identified putative 4EB binding sites that share common features including valine and tyrosine amino acid residues. The combined in vitro and in silico analyses identified interactions with well-known virulence genes but also implicated an effect of 4EB on proteins less commonly associated with S. aureus pathogenesis. These findings suggested potential alternative targets for anti-virulence and anti-biofilm therapeutics.",

    "Abstract": "Background Dysmenorrhea is a prevalent gynecological disorder with multifactorial pathophysiology, including prostaglandin overproduction, inflammation, and pain sensitization. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota may contribute to pain modulation, although causal relationships remain unclear. Methods Bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to investigate causal associations between dysmenorrhea and gut microbiota. Complementary in vivo validation was conducted in a primary dysmenorrhea (PDM) rat model treated with ibuprofen or the traditional Chinese medicine Wenjing Zhitong Decoction (WJZTD). The gut microbiota composition was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing, and correlations with pain-related parameters were assessed. Results Forward MR analyses revealed that genetic liability to dysmenorrhea influenced the abundance of specific gut taxa, notably reducing Lachnospiraceae genera and increasing Erysipelotrichaceae, which was consistent with observed alterations in PDM rats. Reverse MR provided no robust evidence that gut microbiota causally affect dysmenorrhea. In the PDM model, both ibuprofen and WJZTD produced analgesic effects, but induced distinct microbial signatures: ibuprofen increased the presence of Staphylococcus , while WJZTD enriched the population of Bifidobacterium . Correlation analyses highlighted Blautia as a microbiota feature associated with reduced pain, suggesting that modulation of this genus may represent a potential therapeutic strategy. Conclusion This study demonstrates that dysmenorrhea causally alters gut microbiota composition. The restoration of Blautia and Bifidobacterium by WJZTD is associated with pain alleviation, highlighting gut microbiota modulation as a potential strategy for dysmenorrhea management.",

Zhinao Capsule (ZNJN), a proprietary TCM formulation, has demonstrated promising clinical outcomes, particularly in enhancing cognitive function and alleviating AD-related pathology in rodent models. This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of ZNJN in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Behavioral assessments indicated that ZNJN, especially at the high dose, significantly improved learning and memory abilities. Histopathological analysis revealed a marked reduction in hippocampal Aβ 1–42 deposition and decreased activation of microglia and astrocytes, as evidenced by lower expression levels of Iba-1 and GFAP. In addition to central effects, ZNJN alleviated colonic inflammation and improved mucosal integrity. Systemic inflammatory responses were also suppressed, with significant reductions in serum levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and LPS. Furthermore, 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that ZNJN modulated the gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of pro-inflammatory genera and enriching potentially beneficial. These findings suggest that ZNJN exerts neuroprotective effects by modulating the gut microbiota and reducing neuroinflammation through the gut–brain axis.

    "Abstract": "Introduction This study aimed to evaluate the effects of equine-derived Lactobacillus M11 on reproductive performance and metabolic profiles in pregnant Kunming (KM) mice. The objective was to explore the potential of M11 as a safe and effective alternative to antibiotics in antibiotic-free farming systems. Methods Specific pathogen-free (SPF) female KM mice were randomly assigned to a blank control group (BC) and three intervention groups (M11-L, M11-M, M11-H). The intervention groups received daily gavage of M11 at low (1.0 × 10 7 CFU/mL), medium (1.0 × 10 8 CFU/mL), and high (1.0 × 10 9 CFU/mL) concentrations for 21 days. Host physiological parameters, metagenomic profiles, and metabolomic signatures were analyzed to assess the impact of M11 supplementation. Results (1) Host Physiology and Biochemistry: The M11-H group exhibited a significant elevation in albumin (ALB; 40.30 ± 1.75 g/L), suggesting enhanced nutritional status or hepatic protein synthesis. The M11-L group showed transient increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT; 59.57 ± 10.34 U/L) and total cholesterol (TC; 2.90 ± 0.24 mmol/L), indicative of adaptive hepatic lipid metabolism. (2) Microbial Community Reconfiguration: Metagenomic analysis revealed significant structural shifts in the gut microbiota between the BC and M11-H groups. Notably, the M11-H group showed enrichment of Bacillota, which correlated with “O-antigen nucleotide sugar biosynthesis,” while differences in Pseudomonadota were associated with immune regulation. (3) Metabolomic Profiling: Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) demonstrated clear separation in the cecal metabolome space. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis highlighted significant alterations in “glycine/serine/threonine metabolism” and “arginine/proline metabolism” pathways. (4) Integrated Multi-Omics Analysis: Correlation analysis identified a significant positive association between s_Clostridiaceae_bacterium (Bacillota) and specific metabolites (3-hydroxy-4-aminopyridine sulfate), suggesting the formation of a regulatory “gut-reproductive axis.” Discussion The results demonstrate that Lactobacillus M11 improves metabolic support during pregnancy through three primary mechanisms: modulation of the gut microbiota, activation of key metabolic pathways, and enhancement of antioxidant capacity. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the application of probiotic-mediated reproductive support in antibiotic-free farming, highlighting M11 as a promising candidate for improving livestock health and productivity.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Predatory bacteria of the Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs) have long been postulated as living antimicrobials, yet their occurrence and ecological roles within human-associated microbiota have remained uncertain due to the absence of culturable human-derived isolates. Here, we report the first successful isolation and comprehensive characterization of viable Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus from human fecal samples. Methods Targeted enrichment was applied to five pooled fecal samples to facilitate predator recovery. We performed whole-genome sequencing on the isolates and conducted comparative genomics across 162 publicly available Bdellovibrio genomes. Additionally, pangenome analysis of 22 high-quality genomes and phenotypic assays against clinical pathogens were conducted to assess genomic diversity, prey specificity, and biosafety profiles. Results Despite extremely low natural abundance, targeted enrichment recovered predators in two of five pooled samples, which produced characteristic lytic plaques. Sequencing revealed &amp;gt;99% average nucleotide identity to reference strain HD100 with only 26 core single-nucleotide polymorphisms across both isolates, indicating minimal divergence between human-associated and environmental lineages. Comparative genomics showed that only 10.4% of public genomes fulfill criteria for B. bacteriovorus sensu stricto . Pangenome analysis revealed a stable, highly conserved core (~2,500–2,650 genes) and an expanding accessory genome. Phenotypically, the human-derived isolates displayed narrower prey ranges concentrated on Pseudomonas spp. , including multidrug-resistant clinical strains, and no acquired virulence factors were detected. Discussion Collectively, these findings suggest predation in the human gut and that viable Bdellovibrio could be natural, genomically conserved members of the intestinal ecosystem. This work advances a testable keystone-predator framework for human microbiome ecology and opens an ecologically informed therapeutic pathway in which human-associated Bdellovibrio may help control multidrug-resistant pathogens while supporting microbiota homeostasis.",

    "Abstract": "Camel milk (CM) is recognized for its high nutritional enrichment, and the distinction from bovine milk mainly because of its unique protein composition, proteolytic products, and anti-microbial compounds. These unique chemical properties have positive effects on the nutritional value but negative impact on the sensory attributes and consumer acceptability of fermented CM. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on CM fermentation, emphasizing the influence of milk composition on gel and microstructure formation, texture, and overall quality of the products. While the richness of fermented CM in bioactive peptides enhances its nutritional and therapeutic values, major challenges are associated with their thin consistency and weak gel structure. Various strategies to overcome these challenges and develop unique functional fermented CM products are discussed, including the use of alternative starter cultures (e.g., Lactobacillus helveticus, Lb. casei , and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ), stabilizing additives hydrocolloids or proteins, as well as optimized heat treatments, high-pressure processing and other emerging technologies. Despite several processing and formulation procedures, no particular approach has yet offered a comprehensive solution for achieving firm and stable camel yogurt. Therefore, it is important to accept fermented CM products as being different and develop means to improve their sensory quality and consumer acceptance. Overall, this review underscores the necessity for ongoing research to optimize the quality and commercial viability of fermented CM.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) of the K1/ST23 lineage is an emerging global threat associated with invasive community-acquired infections. Increasing reports of virulence–resistance convergence highlight the need for genomic surveillance, particularly within Europe where data remain limited. This study characterizes clinical K1/ST23 KP isolates circulating in the Czech Republic and compares them to a global genomic background to evaluate virulence architecture, resistance acquisition and plasmid evolution. Methods From 2017 to 2025, 570 K. pneumoniae isolates from a tertiary-care hospital were screened for hvKp markers. Ninety-six K1/ST23 isolates were subjected to long-read whole-genome sequencing and plasmid reconstruction. Genomes were analyzed alongside 2,463 international ST23 datasets using core-SNV phylogenomics, virulence/resistance profiling, and structural plasmid mapping. Chromosomal integrations were examined through analysis of flanking insertion-sequence contexts. Results The Czech K1/ST23 KP population exhibited high virulence uniformity (95/96 isolates scoring 9/9) without evidence of a single-clone outbreak, instead forming multiple phylogenetic lineages consistent with recurrent introductions. Eighty-three isolates carried pLVPK-like virulence plasmids; however, structural plasticity was prominent. The iro cluster was relocated to conjugative IncFII/rep_cluster_1418 plasmids in two isolates—one carrying additional AMR genes—and was chromosomally integrated via IS1-mediated recombination in three others. Iut was chromosomally integrated via IS903 (IS5 family) with either classical target-site duplication or recombination-associated insertion. Nine virulence–resistance fusion plasmids (IncFIB–IncFII–IncHI1B or IncC-based) were identified, representing early convergence toward MDR-hvKp. Conclusion K1/ST23 KP circulating in the Czech Republic is highly virulent yet genomically diverse, driven by active plasmid exchange, insertion-sequence–mediated chromosomal integration, and emerging virulence–resistance fusion plasmids. Although carbapenemase genes were absent, ESBL determinants and transmissible virulence loci indicate strong evolutionary potential toward MDR-hvKp. Continuous genomic surveillance and early intervention strategies are essential to mitigate future clinical impact.",

    "Abstract": "Coastal ecosystems in Hainan exhibit steep sea–land gradients in salinity and nutrient availability, yet the rhizosphere microbiome of the pioneer shrub Heliotropium arboreum remains poorly understood. We investigated bacterial and fungal communities across seven coastal sites using replicated transects from seaward to shrub-belt to inland zones, and linked community patterns to soil physicochemical properties and human disturbance. Bacterial communities consistently showed higher richness, evenness, and compositional stability than fungal communities. Alpha diversity increased from seaward to inland zones for both groups, with a stronger gradient in fungi. Community composition was dominated by Proteobacteria and Planctomycetota in bacteria and Ascomycota in fungi, with distinct dominant genera across zones and sites. β -diversity analyses revealed clear differentiation of microbial communities among zones and locations, with fungi showing stronger turnover and site separation than bacteria, indicating higher sensitivity to environmental filtering and disturbance. Redundancy analysis indicated that fungal communities were primarily structured by available potassium, total nitrogen, and soil organic carbon, whereas bacterial communities were most strongly associated with soil pH (7.468–9.613 across sites) and nitrate concentrations. Functional profiling suggested complementary roles in decomposition and nitrogen cycling, and human-disturbed sites showed higher predicted pathogenic potential. Overall, H. arboreum hosts an environmentally filtered rhizosphere microbiome shaped jointly by coastal gradients and disturbance, with fungi responding more strongly than bacteria to spatial and environmental variation.",

    "Abstract": "FNDC3B is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored transmembrane protein with diverse roles in cell adhesion, migration, and growth signaling. Recognized as multifunctional, it contributes to key cellular processes such as adhesion, proliferation, differentiation, and migration, yet its molecular functions remain largely unannotated in the Gene Ontology database. Initially identified as a regulator of adipogenesis, promoting fat cell differentiation, FNDC3B also facilitates lung cell maturation, which is essential for neonatal survival. Dysregulation of FNDC3B is implicated in cancer progression through the promotion of epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), metastasis, and modulation of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. Intriguingly, it exhibits dual roles, acting as either an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, depending on the cellular context. However, the mechanistic determinants of this duality remain elusive. Beyond malignancies, FNDC3B also participates in non-cancerous pathologies, underscoring its broad physiological significance. Although 27 phosphosites have been identified in FNDC3B, the associated signaling networks and functional implications of these modifications remain obscure within the dark phosphoproteome. This review comprehensively delineates the structural, functional, and pathological aspects of FNDC3B, emphasizing its role as a molecular bridge between extracellular and intracellular networks and its growing clinical relevance.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Mobility and cognitive functions often decline concurrently in older adults, and may be particularly detrimental to walking in complex environments such as uneven terrain. Walking on uneven terrain particularly relies on visuospatial working memory to continuously adjust gait patterns; however, this relationship remains understudied. The objectives of this study are to examine group differences in uneven terrain walking speed and visuospatial n-back task performance across varying task demands among younger adults, and among older adults with high and low physical function and to assess whether uneven terrain-induced reductions in walking speed are associated with declines in n-back performance, particularly among low-functioning older adults. As an exploratory aim, we also examined age-related differences in brain activity during n-back performance to provide additional context for interpreting neural responses across tasks. Methods The analysis included 24 younger adults (aged 22.8 ± 3.3) and 44 older adults (aged 74.0 ± 5.6). Using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), older adults were categorized into high physical function ( n = 29) and low physical function ( n = 15), with scores below 10 indicating a lower level of physical function. Uneven terrain walking speed was measured as participants traversed four novel custom-made overground surfaces: flat, low, medium, and high terrain unevenness. Visuospatial walking memory was assessed on a spatial n-back task that included four n-back levels, ranging from 0-back to 3-back. Prefrontal cortical activity was measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) while participants performed the n-back task. Results Compared to younger adults, older adults exhibited poorer working memory performance and slower uneven terrain walking speeds, with both effects being particularly pronounced in low functioning older adults. Slower walking speeds as terrain became more uneven were associated with poorer n-back performance as n-back level increased, with a larger effect size observed in the low physical functioning older adults. fNIRS results revealed comparable levels of prefrontal cortical activity between younger and older groups during the n-back tasks. Prefrontal cortical activity did not increase with higher task demands (i.e., increasing n-back levels) in any of the groups. Conclusion These findings support a relationship between declines in uneven terrain mobility and n-back cognitive function in older adults; however, this relationship was not observed in younger adults. Further research is needed to understand the shared neural mechanisms underlying age-related declines in mobility and cognitive function.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This exploratory study aimed to investigate whether ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE) could quantify rigidity in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and assess potential biomechanical differences between the brain-first and body-first subtypes. Methods Shear wave elastography was used to measure the Young’s modulus (YM) and shear wave velocity (SWV) of the biceps brachii in 70 healthy controls (HCs) and 102 patients with PD (40 classified as body-first, 62 classified as brain-first based on RBDSQ criteria). Group comparisons were conducted using t -tests or ANOVA, correlations were assessed via Pearson or Spearman tests, and diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results Young’s modulus and SWV values were significantly higher in PD patients than in HCs (all p &amp;lt; 0.001). The body-first group exhibited significantly greater YM and SWV than the brain-first group (all p &amp;lt; 0.001). Both SWE parameters showed significant correlations with several clinical scores. Clinically, compared to the brain-first group, the body-first group presented with a higher burden of non-motor symptoms, greater rigidity and axial impairment, but less tremor (all p &amp;lt; 0.05). For discriminating PD from HCs, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.844 for YM and 0.845 for SWV. For exploratory differentiation between body-first and brain-first groups, the AUC was 0.730 for YM and 0.705 for SWV. Conclusion Shear wave elastography is a sensitive tool for quantifying rigidity in PD. This pilot study provides the first evidence of a significant difference in muscle biomechanical properties between PD subgroups classified according to current clinical criteria. While SWE shows promise as a supplementary biomarker, its integration with established subtyping markers (e.g., polysomnography, MIBG scintigraphy) in future multimodal and longitudinal studies is essential to determine its role in clinical subtyping.",

    "Abstract": "Selenium (Se), initially perceived mostly as a harmful element, is now recognised as an effective trace nutrient that promotes plant growth and stress resilience. Though not vital for most plant species, adequate Se concentrations may increase photosynthesis, activate antioxidant defence mechanisms, and improve tolerance to various biotic and abiotic stressors. The application of selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) has been proposed because they exhibit greater bioavailability, higher stability, and lower toxicity compared to inorganic selenium forms, and recent advances in nanotechnology have enabled their efficient synthesis. SeNPs are readily internalised by plants, where they promote growth, regulate osmotic balance, activate stress-responsive genes, and strengthen plant defence mechanisms while minimising pollution. Current research highlights the role of Se and SeNPs in regulating redox homeostasis, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and defence signalling networks. This review synthesises recent findings on Se speciation, uptake pathways, metabolic incorporation, and the diverse physiological roles of SeNPs in improving crop resilience. Future studies must rely on clarifying the molecular mechanisms, determining optimal application strategies, and integrating SeNPs into sustainable agricultural practices to enhance productivity and stress tolerance, thereby addressing concerns over food security under the impacts of climate change.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Telepresence robots (TPRs) must co-navigate with humans in constrained hospital environments, where safety depends on anticipating rather than merely reacting to human motion. Existing approaches rarely integrate short-horizon human-motion forecasting with safety-constrained control, which reduces robustness in dense corridors and ward bays. This study addresses this gap by evaluating an anticipatory, safety-aware co-navigation framework for TPRs. Methods We developed a modular framework that couples a lightweight transformer-based forecaster that predicts multi-agent trajectories under occlusion with a safe reinforcement learning (RL) controller. The forecaster produces short-term distributions over pedestrian states that are embedded into the RL policy state and cost as risk-aware occupancy features. Safety is enforced via constrained policy optimization augmented by a run-time control barrier function (CBF) shield that filters unsafe actions. We benchmarked the approach against a social-force or dynamic window approach (DWA), an attention-based crowd-RL policy, and model predictive control (MPC) with CBF. Experiments were conducted across two hospital-like benchmarks (a crowded corridor and a four-bed ward), totaling 2,400 episodes. Outcomes included task success, collision count, minimum human–robot clearance, near-miss events ( ≤ 0.3 m), time-to-goal, CBF violations, and ablations removing forecasting and the CBF shield. Results Relative to the best-performing baseline, the proposed method improved task success by 21.6% and reduced collisions by 47.3%. Median minimum human–robot clearance increased by 0.19 m, and near-miss events decreased by 38.5%. Time-to-goal was maintained within +2.7% of MPC+CBF while incurring zero CBF violations under the shield. Ablation studies showed that removing forecasting degraded success by 14.2%, whereas removing the CBF shield increased constraint breaches from 0% to 6.1% of steps. Discussion Anticipatory perception combined with Safe-RL yields substantially safer and more reliable telepresence co-navigation in human-dense clinical layouts without sacrificing efficiency. The framework is modular, enabling alternative forecasters and safety shields. Limitations include sensitivity to forecast drift during abrupt changes in crowd flow. Future work will explore on-device adaptation, shared-autonomy overlays to incorporate operator intent, and prospective evaluations in live hospital workflows.",

    "Abstract": "Background Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that substantially impairs quality of life. Drug-induced insomnia (DII), an important cause of secondary insomnia, is often underrecognized, and many potential signals are not yet documented in drug labels. Evidence regarding sex-specific differences in DII remains limited, hindering the development of tailored safety strategies. Objective To identify drug–insomnia associations, assess sex-specific differences, validate signals in an independent database, and characterize the time-to-onset (TTO) of high-risk drugs using large-scale real-world pharmacovigilance data. Methods We conducted a retrospective observational pharmacovigilance study using insomnia-related reports from FAERS (2004Q1–2025Q2). Disproportionality analyses (ROR, PRR, BCPNN, MGPS) were performed, and sex-stratified associations were compared using Wald chi-square tests. Signals were externally validated in the Canadian Vigilance Adverse Reaction Database (CVARDD). Weibull models were applied to evaluate TTO for the drugs with the highest insomnia report counts. Results A total of 266,429 insomnia-related reports were identified, with more reports from females (60.1%) than males (32.0%). A total of 237 drugs demonstrated significant disproportionality signals, including several without labeled insomnia risk. Among the 20 most frequently implicated drugs, 15 showed significant sex–drug interactions. Duloxetine exhibited a stronger association in males, whereas niraparib and levothyroxine showed higher risks in females. External validation confirmed 124 overlapping drugs with consistent signals. TTO analyses revealed an early-failure pattern (Weibull β &amp;lt; 1) for all five high-reporting drugs, with median onset ranging from 3 to 211.5 days. Conclusion This study identified multiple drug–insomnia signals, quantified sex-specific differences, and validated findings in an independent database. These results underscore the importance of recognizing DII and monitoring sex-related variability in clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "Background Executive function deficits are common among patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Executive function refers to higher-order cognitive processes thought to involve fronto-striatal circuits. Some patients with executive deficits may be unable to recognize or report them, a condition we refer to as executive anosognosia. Objective To conduct a comparative analysis of executive anosognosia in patients diagnosed with PSP and PD. Methods We compared an objective neuropsychological assessment (ONA) of composite executive function (ONA-CEF), which includes semantic and phonemic verbal fluency, as well as two sub-scores from the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, with patient- and informant-reported rating scales. We used the Dysexecutive Questionnaire Revised (DEX-R) to evaluate near-transfer executive complaints and the Aachen Activity and Participation Index: Cognition and Participation (AAPI-CP) composite to evaluate far-transfer cognitive and social difficulties. Discrepancy indices were calculated for patients and informants (ONA-CEF minus DEX-R and ONA-CEF minus AAPI-CP). Results PSP patients had significantly larger negative discrepancies than PD patients, indicating stronger executive anosognosia. Although informant reports reduced these discrepancies, significant underreporting persisted in PSP informants. Correlational analyses revealed that patient-reported DEX-R difficulties were strongly correlated with depressive symptoms ( r ≈ 0.65) but not with objective executive performance ( r ≈ 0.00). Conclusion Executive anosognosia is a marker of PSP, highlighting the need for objective neuropsychological assessments in clinical trials. PSP patients’ reports of executive dysfunction are more associated with mood than actual impairment, which challenges the validity of patient-reported outcomes in PSP and related neurological diseases.",

    "Abstract": "We developed Macular, a simulation platform with a graphical interface, designed to produce in silico experiment scenarios for the retina and the primary visual system. A scenario involves generating a three-dimensional structure with interconnected layers, each layer corresponding to a type of “cell” in the retina or visual cortex. The cells can correspond to neurons or more complex structures (such as cortical columns). Inputs are arbitrary videos. The user can use the cells and synapses provided with the software or create their own using a graphical interface where they enter the constituent equations in text format (e.g., LaTeX). They also create the three-dimensional structure via the graphical interface. Macular then automatically generates and compiles the C++ code and generates the simulation interface. This allows the user to view the input video and the three-dimensional structure in layers. It also allows the user to select cells and synapses in each layer and view the activity of their state variables. Finally, the user can adjust the phenomenological parameters of the cells or synapses via the interface. We provide several example scenarios, corresponding to published articles, including an example of a retino-cortical model. Macular was designed for neurobiologists and modelers, specialists in the primary visual system, who want to test hypotheses in silico without the need for programming. By design, this tool allows simulation of natural or altered conditions (e.g., pharmacology, pathology, and development).",

    "Abstract": "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) accounts for up to 70% of all dementia cases, affecting an estimated 23–35 million people worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of AD cases in Latin America, including Peru, is expected to quadruple by 2050. However, these populations remain underrepresented in research, diagnostics, and care. Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), characterized by symptom onset before the age of 65, has been shown to have a strong genetic component, making it valuable for genetic studies. Identifying EOAD-associated mutations in underrepresented populations is crucial for uncovering pathogenic variants that may provide new insights into the disease’s mechanisms. In this article, we present two Peruvian families with early and late onset AD in whom whole-exome sequencing (WES) revealed heterozygous variants associated with AD. In family AD002, we found a heterozygous variant in TREM2 (c.132G &amp;gt; A; p.W44X), a protein-truncating mutation. The proband and 17 family members participated in genetic testing, of which 04 members were carriers of the mutation. This is the first TREM2 -associated mutation reported in the Peruvian population. In family AD009, a novel heterozygous variant in PSEN1 (c.1291G &amp;gt; A; p.A431T) is reported. The proband and 11 family members participated in genetic testing, of which 05 were carriers of the mutation (02 affected siblings and 03 unaffected relatives). This is the first report of PSEN1 A431T associated with AD. Overall, our findings suggest that TREM2 p.W44X is a likely-pathogenic variant while PSEN1 p.A431T is a candidate variant of uncertain significance (VUS) associated with AD; both genetic variants warrant further investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Despite growing interest in interoceptive functioning, primarily due to its pivotal role in physical and mental health, little is known about its developmental origins and the factors that influence it. Interoception—the perception of one’s internal bodily state—in which bottom-up sensory signals from receptors located in the body are integrated with top-down cognitive interpretations, is crucial for homeostatic and emotional regulation and overall wellbeing. Specific questions remain on how and when this function typically develops. Here, we propose that early attachment relationships, facilitated by maternal affective touch (MAT), provide a critical context in which interoceptive signals are integrated within central nervous system structures and learned to be accurately sensed, perceived, and interpreted later in life. We examine neurobiological mechanisms linking MAT to interoceptive pathways by integrating perspectives from attachment theory and interoception research. We argue that relational experiences and embodied interactions in infancy lay the foundation for lifelong interoceptive awareness and adaptive functioning. These perspectives have implications for developmental models of interoception and for translational approaches to psychopathology characterized by interoceptive and autonomic dysregulation, suggesting that early relational and embodied processes may represent important targets for future research and intervention.",

    "Abstract": "The competing requirements of fusion breeder blankets and the high dimensionality of their design space necessitate a systematic treatment to map the variations in performance against given objective metrics and to understand the operational envelope. In this endeavour, a digital engineering pipeline for design evaluation and optimisation has been developed. The tools involved are Hypnos for parametric breeder blanket geometry instantiation, OpenMC for neutronics analysis, MOOSE for thermal hydraulics analysis, and SLEDO for design space sampling, sensitivity analysis, and optimisation. An optimisation of the baseline design for a solid ceramic breeder mock-up that is relevant to the Lithium Breeding Tritium Innovation (LIBRTI) program is performed. Two optimisation studies are performed, the first involving only neutronics, while the second includes the impact of thermal hydraulics. The figures of merit are taken to be the tritium breeding ratio (TBR) and the pressure drop of the outer coolant (combined in a weighted sum for the second analysis). In the first study, for the same acquisition function (taken to be expected improvement), two different values are selected for the hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. In the second study, with the inclusion of thermal hydraulics, a larger parameter space was explored to assess the performance of the method in a higher dimensionality setting. In both cases, the selected figures of merit were improved over the baseline design. Finally, we discuss extensions of the procedure to include a more thorough multi-physics analysis and a more sophisticated treatment of multiple objectives.",

    "Abstract": "Background Bone loss is a serious complication of mechanical unloading, such as that experienced during spaceflight or prolonged bed rest, and represents a significant clinical concern. Although the gut-bone axis has been implicated in bone homeostasis, its role under unloading conditions remains underexplored. Methods In this study, we employed a hindlimb unloading (HU) mouse model to investigate the underlying mechanisms of HU-induced bone loss and the potential protective role of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG). Gut microbiota (16S rRNA sequencing), short-chain fatty acids (LC–MS/MS), intestinal barrier proteins (ZO-1/Occludin), inflammatory cytokines in bone tissue (TNF-α/IL-1β/IL-10), regulatory T (Treg), bone markers (BALP/OPG/OCN/PINP/CTX), and microarchitecture (Micro-CT) were analyzed. Results Hindlimb unloading (HU) disrupted gut microbiota composition, reduced short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing bacteria, and decreased SCFA levels, which was accompanied by reduced expression of ZO-1 and Occludin, elevated circulating LPS levels, and enhanced inflammatory markers in the bone microenvironment. Additionally, the proportion of Treg cells was reduced, which was associated with markers indicative of disrupted bone remodeling. LGG treatment was associated with partial restoration of microbial composition and SCFA levels, accompanied by improved intestinal barrier markers, reduced LPS and inflammatory cytokines, increased Treg proportions, and amelioration of bone microarchitecture. Conclusion These findings suggested that LGG may have conferred protection against unloading-induced bone loss, potentially through modulation of the gut microbiota, alterations in SCFA profiles, improvement of intestinal barrier function, and immune regulatory changes involving Treg cells. This work highlighted the therapeutic potential of targeting the gut-bone axis to mitigate bone loss in microgravity or immobilization settings.",

    "Abstract": "Objective The purpose of this study is to investigate whether depression may mediate the association between arthritis and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in diverse BMI-based obese populations with multi-parameter metabolic signatures including insulin resistance, inflammatory markers, and lipid metabolism indices. Methods The relationships between arthritis, MCI, and depression were investigated in a large-scale study that used logistic regression, subgroup analyses, and mediation analyses. The participants in the study came from obese individuals classified into distinct metabolic obesity phenotypes based on insulin resistance, inflammatory markers, and lipid metabolism. Results Arthritis is positively correlated with MCI (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.60–2.17, p &amp;lt; 0.001), especially in the metabolically unhealthy overweight/obesity population (OR = 2.27, 95% CI = 1.73–2.97, p &amp;lt; 0.001), and depression plays a mediating role in the relationship between arthritis and MCI in this population (proportion of mediation: 17.5%). Conclusion The results of this study highlight the potential clinical value of an integrated management strategy combining metabolic regulation, anti-inflammatory treatment, and routine depression screening in obese patients with arthritis to reduce the risk of cognitive decline.",

    "Abstract": "Diet is a pivotal determinant of gut microbial ecology, giving not only rise to specific bacterial compositionality but also its functional output. Studying functional readouts—such as microbial metabolite production—could provide a more accurate and mechanistically informative measure of intervention outcome than traditional compositional profiling alone. Bacterial membrane vesicles (bMVs) are gaining attention as mediators of microbial metabolism and output. These nanoparticles are selectively released as carriers of bioactive proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, and metabolites reflective of the activity of the parent bacteria. Importantly, bMVs are rigid, can efficiently be isolated from feces, and are able to stably transport their cargo to interact with the host. In interacting with immune cells or pathogen recognition receptors, they can potentiate inflammatory responses. Given their extensive, multifaceted involvement in inter-Kingdom communication, bMVs represent an important biomarker for evaluating dietary modulation of gut microbial function. We propose that characterization of gut-derived bMVs offers a highly sensitive, mechanistically grounded approach to titrating impact of dietary interventions. By capturing shifts in microbial metabolic activity and inflammatory potential, bMV-based assessments could complement or surpass traditional measures of microbiome compositional change. Integrating bMV profiling into dietary intervention studies may therefore provide new insight into the functional consequences of diet–microbiome interactions and help refine strategies aimed at reducing inflammation and promoting host health.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Radiation recall reaction (RRR) is a rare and poorly understood phenomenon of tissue radiotoxicity. It is typically triggered by exposure to certain agents, most commonly cytotoxic drugs such as cisplatin. We conducted a scoping review following the methodology proposed by the JBI collaboration and PRISMA-ScR extension. It aimed to map the evidence concerning the treatment of RRR triggered by cisplatin. Methods Searches were performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Database, and ProQuest™ on March 9, 2025. Eligible studies included primary research, guidelines, and study protocols that addressed RRR as a primary or secondary outcome. A case report was also described. Results Eight studies were included, and the main treatments for RRR were topical steroids and antihistamines. A 36-year-old woman with cervical cancer developed intense hyperpigmentation in the inguinal, vulvar, and anal areas, along with anal and labial fissures, dry desquamation in the inguinal region, and vaginal stenosis, 3 days after cisplatin. The diagnosis was RRR affecting mucosa and skin in the intimate region. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) was initiated using lasers emitting wavelengths of 660 and 808 nm for tissue repair in the vulva, anus, and groin, and LEDs emitting 450 nm for vaginal stenosis and 590 nm for hyperpigmentation. Following the first PBMT session, the patient showed an excellent clinical response after 1 week, with a significant reduction in the severity of RRR. Conclusion PBMT appears to be a viable, non-invasive, and low-cost treatment option for RRR, with no reported side effects.",

Chinese herbal medicine, which is based on accurate Chinese medicine (CM) syndrome diagnosis, plays a vital role during cancer treatment. This study aimed to validate the established CM syndrome diagnostic criteria for early breast cancer, enhancing their application in clinical settings. Methods A multicenter prospective clinical study was conducted to collect epidemiological data on CM syndromes. Two attending doctors from the CM breast department performed syndrome differentiation using established diagnostic criteria and compared it to two clinical experts with associate senior professional titles. Metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were utilized to assess the validity of the diagnostic test. Results A total of 641 eligible cases were enrolled from June 2022 to October 2023 from seven hospitals in China. The sensitivity rates for all syndromes ranged from 70.37% to 92.00%, with the highest rate for Spleen and Stomach disharmony in the postoperative stage. Specificity varied from 86.84% to 98.89%, with most criteria exceeding 90%. Overall accuracy of the diagnostic criteria was between 84.25% and 94.45%. Positive predictive values ranged from 72.22% to 98.21%, while negative predictive values spanned from 79.25% to 98.82%, with most syndromes above 80%. The concordance rate for diagnostic criteria ranged from 90.91% to 96.45%, with Kappa values between 0.747 and 0.926. Conclusions This study demonstrated that the diagnostic criteria exhibit high reliability, confirming the validity of CM syndrome diagnostic criteria among different treatment stages for early breast cancer and contributing to standardizing clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for the majority of cases. Despite advances in therapy, survival remains poor due to late diagnosis and treatment resistance. Identification of reliable prognostic biomarkers is essential to improve risk stratification and clinical outcomes. Methods MRPL23 expression was evaluated as a potential prognostic biomarker in NSCLC using immunohistochemical analysis of tumor specimens from 110 patients and mRNA expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort. Associations between MRPL23 expression and clinicopathological features, as well as overall survival, were analyzed using survival statistics. Results MRPL23 expression was significantly higher in NSCLC tissues than in normal lung tissues (p &amp;lt; 0.0001), with particularly elevated levels observed in squamous cell carcinoma. High MRPL23 protein expression was detected in 57 of 110 cases (51.8%) and was associated with shorter overall survival (median OS 34 vs. 48 months; HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.01–2.58, p = 0.04). These findings were validated in the TCGA cohort, where high MRPL23 mRNA expression correlated with worse overall survival (HR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17–1.83, p &amp;lt; 0.01). Discussion MRPL23 overexpression, particularly in lung squamous cell carcinoma, is associated with poor prognosis and may serve as an independent prognostic factor in NSCLC. These results suggest that MRPL23 represents a promising biomarker for improving risk stratification and guiding personalized therapeutic strategies in patients with NSCLC.",

    "Abstract": "Ultra-low rectal cancer (defined as a tumor located within 5 cm from the anal verge) poses unique challenges owing to its distinctive anatomical location, necessitating an optimal balance between oncologic safety and functional preservation. This review focuses on the clinical progress and technological innovations in sphincter-preserving management for ultra-low rectal cancer and is organized within a hierarchical framework encompassing oncologic/anatomical principles, surgical procedures, operative approaches/platforms, specimen-extraction strategies, and multimodal therapy. We first outline plane-based resection principles centered on total mesorectal excision (TME) and key aspects of margin quality control. We then systematically summarize the spectrum of sphincter-preserving procedures, including low/ultra-low anterior resection (LAR/uLAR) and reconstructive options such as coloanal anastomosis (CAA), the transabdominal–transanal approach (TATA), pull-through procedures (Bacon and its modifications), and intersphincteric resection (ISR), with comparisons of indications, oncologic safety, and functional outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of laparoscopic, robotic, and transanal approaches (e.g., TaTME) on deep pelvic exposure, anatomical precision, and the learning curve, as well as the trade-offs between minimally invasive benefits and safety control associated with specimen-extraction strategies such as NOSE. Finally, we summarize the role of neoadjuvant and total neoadjuvant therapy in facilitating sphincter or organ preservation. Overall, sphincter-preserving treatment for ultra-low rectal cancer should be guided by standardized oncologic principles and tailored combinations of procedures and approaches, with the overarching goal of balancing functional benefit against oncologic safety.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To evaluate the predictive value of peripheral blood immune markers for progression to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing endocrine therapy. Methods This retrospective study included 106 PCa patients treated with endocrine therapy between 2021 and 2024. Peripheral blood immune parameters were compared between patients who did and did not experience progression to CRPC (progression and stable groups, respectively). The identified independent predictors of CRPC were then used to construct a nomogram for the identification of high-risk patients for early intervention. Internal validation was performed using the bootstrap method with 1000 resamples. Nomogram performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analyses. Results Univariate analysis showed significant differences ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) in prostate-specific antigen level, Gleason score, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio, systemic immune inflammation index (SII), and pan-immune inflammation value (PIV), CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio, and T4 stage between the progression and stable groups. Multivariate analysis further identified the PLR, SII, CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio, and T4 stage as independent risk factors for CRPC development. The developed predictive model demonstrated strong predictive performance (area under the curve =0.934, Hosmer–Lemeshow P &amp;gt;0.05). The c-index for internal validation was 0.914, further confirming the predictive performance of the model. Employing clinically optimized thresholds, survival analysis confirmed that a PLR ≥140, SII ≥520, and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio &amp;lt;1.6 could significantly predict the 2-year CRPC risk. Conclusion The PLR, SII, CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio, and T4 tumor stage are independent risk factors for CRPC progression within 2 years of endocrine therapy. The survival prediction model based on these factors offers good predictive efficacy.",

These tumors tend to be more aggressive and are associated with a worse prognosis compared to standard urothelial carcinomas. Case presentation A 60-year-old man was found to have cancer in his left ureter and subsequently underwent a robot-assisted laparoscopic procedure to partially remove the left ureter and perform a ureterovesical anastomosis. The postoperative analysis revealed high-grade urothelial carcinoma with marked squamous differentiation(40% squamous differentiation) and microsatellite stability (MSS). Three months after surgery, the abdominal incision recurred and abdominal mass resection was performed again. One month after abdominal surgery, imaging evaluation showed lymph node metastasis in the left lower wall of the bladder and retroperitoneum.Ultimately, the patient attained complete imaging remission following treatment with the \\GC\\ chemotherapy regimen, along with \\tislelizumab\\ immunotherapy and radiotherapy. Conclusion The \\GC\\ chemotherapy protocol, along with \\tislelizumab\\ immunotherapy and radiotherapy, shows remarkable effectiveness in treating metastatic ureteral urothelial carcinoma with significant squamous differentiation.",

    "Abstract": "We report a 58-year-old woman with cervical squamous cell carcinoma who developed an early-onset left external iliac artery rupture followed by a sigmoid fistula after multimodal treatment. Notably, key baseline tumor parameters-including maximal tumor diameter and stromal invasion depth-were not documented preoperatively because PET-CT was not performed and the original MRI/CT datasets from the outside hospital were unavailable. This incomplete staging likely contributed to underestimation of disease extent and to selection of a non-guideline-concordant primary radical hysterectomy, although postoperative pathology ultimately confirmed FIGO 2018 stage IIIC2 disease with extensive nodal metastases. The patient subsequently received adjuvant pelvic external-beam radiotherapy and vaginal cuff high-dose-rate brachytherapy. One month after completing radiotherapy, she presented with acute hematochezia and hemorrhagic shock. Angiography revealed active extravasation from the left external iliac artery adjacent to a postoperative lymphocele, and a covered stent was deployed with temporary hemostasis. Despite intensive antimicrobial and supportive therapy, she later developed a sigmoid fistula, pelvic abscess, recurrent bleeding, and persistent sepsis, culminating in fatal deterioration. The arterial rupture was considered to be multifactorial, with potential contributions from extensive lymphadenectomy, lymphocele formation, infection, and radiation-related tissue fragility. This case underscores the critical importance of comprehensive preoperative assessment and guideline-based primary treatment selection in cervical cancer, as inappropriate initial management may predispose patients to severe lymphatic, infectious, and vascular complications. Early multidisciplinary surveillance and timely intervention may be essential to prevent catastrophic outcomes. In gynecologic oncology, the combination of early-onset iliac arterial rupture and subsequent sigmoid fistula shortly after postoperative radiotherapy remains exceedingly rare, and to our knowledge has not been previously reported in a patient with unrecognized FIGO IIIC2 disease at initial treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Background The third leading cause of death worldwide is colorectal cancer due to a lack of early detection biomarkers and therapeutic small molecules. Advances in systems biology offer a combination of multi-omics and Artificial intelligence to discover the potential biomarkers and targets. Methods We used a combination of in silico and in vitro methodologies to identify potential biomarkers and a putative mediator of Embelin in colon cancer treatment. The human colorectal cancer (gene expression profiling by array) datasets were analyzed by using Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis (WGCNA), and predictive AI models were trained by three algorithms (LASSO, SVM-RFE, RF). All three algorithms predicted COL6A3 as a common hub gene. qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression level of COL6A3 along with apoptosis markers in HCT116 cell lines (human colorectal cancer) by treating Embelin in a dose-dependent manner. Results Trained model predicted COL6A3 as a prominent hub gene across all three ML algorithms with high cross validation accuracy (AUC values: &amp;gt; ~0.90), showing the accuracy of predictions and feature selections of the trained model. Embelin treatment results in the upregulation of pro-apoptotic markers (BAX, CASPASE3) and the downregulation of anti-apoptotic genes (BCL2, PI3KCA). These findings suggest that COL6A3 is a candidate biomarker and a potential mediator of embelin activity. Conclusion This study underscores the integration of AI, multi-omics, and in vitro studies for the discovery of candidate biomarkers and mechanistic insights into pathway modulation by Embelin in colorectal cancer. The research successfully identified and validated the role of COL6A3 as a potential biomarker and putative target modulated by Embelin in colon cancer.",

Multiple ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)—from crizotinib to newer agents such as entrectinib, lorlatinib, repotrectinib, taletrectinib, and the highly selective zidesamtinib—have improved systemic and intracranial outcomes, although resistance remains inevitable and biologically diverse, involving both on-target kinase mutations and off-target mechanisms. This review synthesizes current knowledge on ROS1 biology, diagnostic strategies, therapeutic options, and resistance mechanisms. We outline ROS1 fusion architecture and signaling, highlight partner-specific features, and summarize available diagnostic modalities. In clinical practice, RNA-based next-generation sequencing (NGS), often preceded by immunohistochemistry screening, provides the most sensitive approach for fusion detection and resistance profiling. Given the expanding therapeutic landscape and increasing complexity of treatment sequencing, we adopt a pragmatic, practice-oriented framework. CNS-penetrant next-generation TKIs with activity against common resistance mutations now constitute preferred first-line therapy. Repotrectinib and taletrectinib show strong systemic and intracranial efficacy, including activity against ROS1 G2032R , whereas zidesamtinib offers high selectivity with encouraging early data. Pemetrexed-based chemotherapy remains an effective option, whereas immune checkpoint inhibitors provide limited benefit. At progression, molecular reassessment is essential to guide tailored therapy. Looking ahead, priorities include optimizing sequencing strategies, evaluating perioperative targeted approaches, and incorporating genomic monitoring to anticipate resistance. These advances are reshaping the natural history of ROS1 -rearranged NSCLC and supporting a more durable, precision-driven treatment paradigm.",

    "Abstract": "Peritumoral brain edema is an accompanying symptom of meningiomas, and its severity impacts patient symptoms and prognosis. Meningioma-related peritumoral brain edema can result in severe symptoms such as neurological disturbance and brain herniation. Traditionally, the main treatment options for peritumoral brain edema in the perioperative period have been osmotherapy and corticosteroids, but the side effects and limited effectiveness cannot be ignored. This review summarizes the known influencing factors and mechanisms that contribute to meningioma-related brain edema, discusses the limitations of existing edema treatments, and outlines future edema treatments. More research on meningioma-related peritumoral brain edema is needed to improve patient outcomes and enhance treatment efficacy.",

    "Abstract": "Background Pediatric and adult glioblastomas (GBM) represent biologically distinct entities requiring age-tailored therapeutic strategies. However, rapid and non-invasive methods to distinguish these molecular subtypes remain an unmet clinical need. This study evaluates the potential of confocal Raman spectroscopy combined with deep learning as a label-free diagnostic tool to differentiate pediatric from adult GBM based on intrinsic biochemical fingerprints. Methods We acquired n=1,382 Raman spectra from a cohort of six patient-derived GBM neurosphere cell lines, comprising a pediatric model (SF188) and five adult-origin lines. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network was trained to classify spectra by age group. To ensure rigorous validation and generalizability, performance was assessed on a strictly held-out external test set (20% of data), completely excluded from model optimization. Results The deep learning model successfully differentiated pediatric from adult GBM signatures with an overall accuracy of 83.6% and an ROC AUC of 0.855 on the independent test set. Spectral analysis revealed distinct vibrational modes, highlighting significant variations in lipid, protein, and nucleic acid content between age groups. Notably, the model achieved a high sensitivity for the pediatric phenotype (91.4% identification rate) . Conclusion This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that Raman spectroscopy, augmented by deep learning, can identify age-related molecular variations in GBM without extrinsic labeling. By capturing the unique biochemical landscape of pediatric versus adult tumors, this approach lays the foundation for rapid, automated, and objective diagnostic workflows in precision neuro-oncology.",

    "Abstract": "Background The optimal duration of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II–III colorectal cancer (CRC) remains uncertain. Although a 3-month regimen may reduce toxicity, particularly peripheral sensory neuropathy (PSN), its effect on long-term survival is unclear. This study systematically compared the efficacy and safety of 3 versus 6 months of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II–III CRC patients. Methods A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing 3 months versus 6 months FOLFOX or CAPOX adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II–III CRC patients. Outcomes included disease-free survival (DFS), 3-year DFS rate, overall survival (OS), chemotherapy completion rate, and PSN. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE approach, and trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to assess the robustness of the results. Results Six RCTs involving a total of 16,420 stage II–III CRC patients were included. In the overall patients, the 3-month regimen showed no significant difference in DFS compared with the 6-month regimen (HR = 1.05, 95% CI 0.98–1.13, P = 0.18). Within the FOLFOX subgroup, the risk of DFS events was increased in the 3-month regimen (HR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.11–1.33, P &amp;lt; 0.001), with a similar difference observed among stage III patients (HR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.06–1.43, P = 0.007). No significant differences were observed in OS or 3-year OS rate, and all subgroup analyses showed no statistically significant differences in 3-year DFS rates. The 3-month regimen demonstrated a significantly higher chemotherapy completion rate, and grade 3–4 PSN was significantly lower in the 3 months regimen. Conclusion Stage II patients may preferentially receive a 3-month treatment regimen, whereas stage III patients receiving FOLFOX should still consider a 6-month regimen.

    "Abstract": "Background Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults. It is characterized by the accumulation of mature monoclonal B lymphocytes. While native kidney infiltration in CLL is relatively common and typically subclinical, involvement of a transplanted kidney is exceedingly rare and may have profound clinical implications. Case Summary We present the case of a 65-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease secondary to hypertension and diabetes mellitus who underwent kidney transplantation in 2016. Several years later, she was diagnosed with Rai stage I CLL following imaging and histopathologic analysis of axillary lymphadenopathy. Despite an initially indolent course, she developed worsening renal function in 2025. A biopsy of the allograft revealed CLL infiltration consistent with her prior nodal disease. The patient was started on Zanubrutinib, a Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi), with stabilization of renal function. Conclusion This case highlights a rare and clinically significant presentation of CLL involving a renal allograft. As the therapeutic landscape evolves with the advent of BTK inhibitors, prompt recognition and treatment of extranodal CLL involvement may improve outcomes. This case represents only the second reported instance of successful BTKi use for CLL infiltration in a kidney transplant recipient.",

    "Abstract": "The Wnt signaling pathway, a highly conserved molecular cascade, orchestrates critical biological processes including embryonic development, cell differentiation, and proliferation across diverse organisms. Despite the pivotal role that Wnt signaling plays in many diseases, most notably cancer, there are still no FDA-approved, efficacious drugs available that inhibit this pathway. Most Wnt inhibitors target upstream components (e.g., Wnt ligand production and receptors) rather than the most commonly mutated downstream proteins in the pathway. Consequently, there is considerable interest in developing drugs that target the downstream effector, β-catenin. This review examines the challenges in targeting β-catenin, current approaches, and insights into overcoming on-target toxicity associated with cadherin-bound β-catenin.",

    "Abstract": "Background Integrating optical coherence tomography (OCT) into the pre-surgical stage of cataract management holds significant clinical and economic potential, particularly in low-to-middle-income countries like Kazakhstan. Objective This study aimed to evaluate these impacts by prospectively recruiting 225 patients, aged 71 ± 6 years, from two ophthalmology surgical centers in Almaty, Kazakhstan. Methods Patients undergoing phacoemulsification of cataracts with monofocal intraocular lens (IOL) implantation between January 2022 and December 2023 were divided into two groups: the OCT group (n=75) received pre-operative OCT, while the Control group (n=150) did not. Visual acuity (VA) was measured pre- and post-surgery, and the cost-effectiveness of the surgical strategies was analyzed. Results The OCT group experienced a significantly greater improvement in VA (-0.647 ± 0.232 logMAR) compared to the Control group (-0.543 ± 0.244 logMAR), with a notable interaction between time and group (F(df) = 396.5, p&amp;lt; 0.001). Additionally, pre-existing concomitant diseases were diagnosed in 24.8% of cases in the OCT group and 31% in the Control group. Conclusion The economic analysis revealed that the integration of OCT facilitated combined surgical procedures during a single operative session, thereby reducing overall costs. These findings suggest that implementing OCT in the pre-surgical stage of cataract management can significantly enhance visual outcomes and decrease the cost of ophthalmology services in Kazakhstan.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives Neuromodulation is an advanced therapy for managing chronic pain by modulating nerve activity through electrical stimulation. This study evaluates the clinical outcomes of neuromodulation therapies, including spinal cord stimulation (SCS), occipital nerve stimulation (ONS), and peripheral nerve field stimulation (PNFS) in patients with refractory chronic pain. Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted at the Department of Neurosurgery, Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital Olomouc, on 70 patients who underwent neuromodulation therapy between 2019 and 2024. Indications included Persistent Spinal Pain Syndrome Type 2 (PSPS-T2), Persistent Spinal Pain Syndrome Type 1 (PSPS-T1), Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), Failed Neck Surgery Syndrome, and neuropathic pain. Pain relief was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) before and after implantation. Only patients with a successful trial stimulation who proceeded to permanent implantation were included in the analysis, and outcomes aree therefore interpreted as descriptive results in a responder-selected cohort. Results Patients experienced significant pain reduction post-implantation. Among PSPS-T2 patients ( n = 40), mean VAS scores decreased from 5.58 to 1.80 (67.2% reduction). Similar trends were observed in PSPS-T1 (64.5% reduction), CRPS (85% reduction), and other conditions, with an overall mean pain reduction of 58.3%. Percutaneous electrodes and non-rechargeable implantable pulse generators (IPGs) were most commonly used. Conclusion In this single-center, retrospective real-world cohort, neuromodulation was associated with clinically meaningful pain reduction among patients who responded to trial stimulation. These data primarily illustrate contemporary neuromodulation practice and outcomes in a Central European academic center.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives Decision support tools, such as predictive risk models (PRMs), may assist medical personnel identify child abuse and neglect (CAN). However, no prior work has established whether Medicaid claims alone are sufficient for accurate prediction. We developed a Medicaid claims-based PRM to predict CAN, validating against medical encounters and clinical diagnoses that precede and follow a CAN-related diagnosis code. Methods We conducted a case–control study of Medicaid-enrolled children born in New York State between 2006 and 2008. Children with a CAN indicator in the first 10 years of life (case) were matched to children without (control) based on sex, race/ethnicity, county, low birthweight (&amp;lt;2,500 g), birth year, and months enrolled in Medicaid. Outcomes in 1 year included medical encounters, ED visits by injury intent, number of providers, and expenditures, as well as death within 5 years. Results Of the 50,515 children in the matched sample, 13,109 (26%) were Black, 24,298 (48%) were female, 31,917 (63%) resided in New York City, and by design, 13,429 (26.5%) were diagnosed with CAN before age 10. The final PRM achieved an area under the receiver operating curve of 62%, an accuracy of 75%, a sensitivity of 98.5%, and a specificity of 9.5%. Children with a CAN indicator and those with a high probability of CAN had more high-expenditure medical encounters, particularly injury-related ED visits, compared with those without in the year following the index date. Conclusions This claims-based tool demonstrated high sensitivity, identifying nearly all children with a CAN indicator; however, it had very low specificity. Future work should link Medicaid claims to child protective services reports to increase predictive accuracy.",

    "Abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood malignancy, for which chemotherapy remains the cornerstone of treatment. Skin toxicity is a frequent adverse reaction to chemotherapy; however, progression from paronychia to necrotizing soft tissue infection of the fingertips is uncommon. This report describes the case of a 7-year-old child with ALL who developed paronychia following combination chemotherapy with vincristine and daunorubicin. The infection progressed to involve multiple fingertips as necrotizing soft tissue infection, a course facilitated by the patient's underlying severe neutropenia. Raoultella ornithinolytica was identified on blood culture. A structured, multistep nursing protocol was implemented, including local disinfection, ethacridine lactate compresses, topical application of recombinant human epidermal growth factor solution and mupirocin ointment, and local oxygen insufflation. This regimen resulted in significant improvement of the lesions. Within 7 days, pain subsided, edema reduced by more than 50%, and joint mobility was largely restored, with complete clinical resolution achieved within 14 days. This case highlights the importance of early recognition of chemotherapy-induced skin toxicity and the value of standardized stepwise wound management in improving functional outcomes. It provides a practical reference for managing this rare yet severe cutaneous adverse reaction in children and underscores the critical role of specialized nursing in supportive oncology care.",

Methods This is a prospective cohort study conducted in a level III neonatal unit in Bucharest, Romania. Neonates born to mothers with ICP (serum bile acids ≥10 μmol/L within seven days before delivery) will be enrolled alongside gestational age, sex and birthweight-matched controls. Serum samples will be collected at 24 h, 48–72 h and on day 7 of life. Quantitative ELISA kits will be used to assess serum biomarkers associated with surfactant dysfunction and lung injury. Perinatal and clinical outcomes will be recorded systematically. Results The primary aims are to compare the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), the need for surfactant administration and serum biomarker profiles between ICP-exposed and unexposed neonates. Secondary aims include evaluating respiratory support requirements, neonatal morbidity and mortality across groups. Conclusions We expect that neonates exposed to maternal cholestasis will have a higher incidence of RDS, increased surfactant need, and biomarker alterations consistent with pulmonary compromise. This study may improve understanding of bile acid-related lung injury and inform early risk stratification strategies in affected newborns. (NCT06679972).",

    "Abstract": "Objective To evaluate the technical feasibility, safety, and clinical outcomes of bronchial sleeve anastomosis in a pediatric case series encompassing two main etiologies (trauma and tumor). Methods A retrospective analysis was conducted on 8 pediatric patients who underwent bronchial sleeve resection at our center between May 2018 and May 2025. Preoperative diagnosis was confirmed by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and bronchoscopy. Collected data included demographic characteristics, surgical parameters, pathological results, perioperative outcomes, and follow-up information. Results All eight procedures were successfully completed without perioperative mortality. The mean operative time was 306.88 ± 127.31 min, with mean intraoperative blood loss of 51.25 ± 23.57 mL. The mean duration of mechanical ventilation was 16.06 ± 12.57 h, chest tube drainage was maintained for 234.86 ± 91.04 h, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was 25.00 ± 8.45 days. The median follow-up period was 2.7 years (range: 0.6–7.1 years). Perioperative complications included two cases of mild anastomotic stenosis, both successfully managed with bronchoscopic cryotherapy, and one case of chylothorax that resolved with conservative drainage. The trauma group required significantly longer postoperative mechanical ventilation compared to the tumor group ( P &amp;lt; 0.05). At the last follow-up, all patients were alive with patent airways, recovered pulmonary function, and had resumed normal activities. No tumor recurrence was observed in the oncology patients. Conclusion Bronchial sleeve resection represents a safe, feasible, and effective lung-preserving procedure in carefully selected pediatric patients. This technique allows complete lesion removal while maximizing pulmonary function preservation and promoting long-term quality of life, establishing it as a preferred surgical option for children with severe airway trauma or bronchial tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To determine whether a lung ultrasound–guided positioning strategy reduces the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in mechanically ventilated neonates compared with conventional empiric repositioning. Data sources A prospective, randomized controlled trial. Interventions In this prospective, randomized controlled trial, term neonates requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48 h were enrolled in the Level III NICU of Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital from December 2023 to December 2025. Eligible infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either conventional positioning or LUS-guided positioning management. The LUS-guided group underwent twice-daily bedside ultrasound assessments to detect atelectasis or consolidation, and posture was adjusted accordingly to optimize dependent drainage and ventilation–perfusion matching. The primary outcome was the incidence of VAP. Secondary outcomes included duration of mechanical ventilation, feeding intolerance, pulmonary hemorrhage, pneumothorax, new-onset intracranial hemorrhage, mortality, and NICU length of stay. Results A total of 94 neonates were randomized (47 per group), and 89 completed follow-up. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. The incidence of VAP was significantly lower in the LUS-guided group than in the control group (17.8% vs. 38.6%, p = 0.017), with an unadjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.13–0.90) and an adjusted OR of 0.32 (95% CI, 0.12–0.86, p = 0.024).

No significant differences were observed in other secondary outcomes, including pulmonary hemorrhage, pneumothorax, feeding intolerance, new intracranial hemorrhage, or mortality (all p &amp;gt; 0.05). Conclusion Lung ultrasound–guided positioning significantly reduced the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and shortened ventilation duration without increasing adverse events. This physiologically informed, radiation-free approach enables individualized postural management to optimize lung aeration and secretion clearance. LUS-guided care is feasible, safe, and easily integrated into NICU workflows, providing a promising adjunct to standard VAP prevention bundles. Further multicenter, adequately powered trials and cost-effectiveness studies are warranted to confirm these findings and support broader clinical adoption.",

    "Abstract": "Background Sepsis remains a major cause of hospital mortality. Sepsis-induced intestinal injury is regarded as the driving force behind the rapid progression of critical conditions such as shock and sepsis, and serves as the initiating factor of subsequent organ dysfunction. Therefore, the development of effective therapeutic agents to restore intestinal barrier function is crucial for improving outcomes in sepsis. Methods A caecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model was established in mice to induce sepsis, and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to simulate sepsis in vitro . These models were used to investigate the protective efficacy and molecular mechanisms of hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) against sepsis-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. Results HSYA alleviated intestinal barrier dysfunction in septic mice, markedly reduced levels of inflammatory factors, and improved survival. In vitro , HSYA enhanced barrier function of IECs, reduced mitochondrial fragmentation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis by upregulating the expression of Bcl-2 and SOD2. Conclusion The study demonstrated the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of HSYA in ameliorating sepsis-induced intestinal barrier injury, providing a new strategy for sepsis treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with a microsatellite-stable (MSS) status exhibit poor responsiveness to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade. Pyroptosis induction may resensitize MSS tumors to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade; however, the expression of GSDME, a key executor of pyroptosis, is often downregulated in CRC. Here, curcumin (CUR), a natural polyphenol, was identified as a potentiator of GSDME-dependent pyroptosis in CRC. We discovered that CUR upregulates GSDME expression by inhibiting the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) in the MSS-type CT26 and HT29 cell lines and activating the caspase-3/GSDME signalling axis, resulting in increased pyroptosis. In CT26 tumors, CUR-enhanced pyroptosis reshaped tumor-infiltrating immune subsets and potentiated the efficacy of anti–PD-1 therapy. Notably, the synergistic antitumor activity of CUR combined with PD-1 blockade in CT26 tumors is strictly dependent on the caspase-3/GSDME axis, as the therapeutic benefit was abolished in GSDME-knockout tumors. These findings establish CUR as a safe and effective adjuvant for PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in MSS CRC, particularly in tumors with low GSDME expression.",

    "Abstract": "In the field of individualized anesthesia, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) models are crucial as they assist in determining the appropriate dosage for various patient groups. This research reviews the development of primary PKPD anesthetic models proposed in the literature from 1987 to 2024. The results from 33 studies are combined, offering a range of concepts from the earliest contributions, such as the “pharmacokinetic mass” concept of Shibutani et al. for fentanyl in obese patients, to the most recent developments in multi-input control strategies for managing anesthesia depth with propofol and remifentanil. Recent advancements are also discussed, including the propofol model proposed by Braathen et al. for severe obesity, which employs innovative scaling techniques to enhance dose accuracy. This study examines physiologically based modeling approaches, reviews traditional compartmental models, and highlights the use of nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. The review concludes by outlining future research aimed at creating more individualized, closed-loop anesthetic delivery systems, emphasizing significant developments in PKPD modeling and identifying limitations in the existing techniques.",

    "Abstract": "Background Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy is a frequent chemotherapy complication that causes nerve damage and profoundly reduces patients’ quality of life. Despite extensive preclinical evidence supporting the neuroprotective potential of trimetazidine against peripheral neuropathy, its clinical efficacy remains unexplored. Objectives This proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effect of trimetazidine administered during the early phase of treatment on the incidence of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer. Methods This parallel randomized placebo-controlled blinded endpoint trial was conducted at the Oncology Center, Minia University, Egypt, involving 60 breast cancer patients scheduled to receive weekly paclitaxel 90 mg/m 2 . Patients were randomized to receive either trimetazidine 35 mg once daily or placebo alongside standard care. Measurements included the incidence of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy assessed by the National Cancer Institute’s Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 5.0, patient quality of life via the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group–Neurotoxicity (FACT-GOG-Ntx) subscale, and exploratory serum biomarkers, specifically nerve growth factor (NGF) levels. Neuropathy and biomarkers were evaluated over an 8-week period. Main Results The incidence of grade 2 and 3 peripheral neuropathies was significantly lower in the trimetazidine group compared to controls, with notable reductions in paresthesia (p = 0.037), peripheral motor neuropathy (p = 0.004), and dysesthesia (p = 0.045), except for peripheral sensory neuropathy (p = 0.152). Clinically significant worsening in neuropathy-related quality of life was more frequent in the control group compared to the trimetazidine group (p = 0.001). Additionally, the trimetazidine group exhibited a significantly greater percentage increase in serum nerve growth factor from baseline (p = 0.003). Conclusion Trimetazidine offers a safe and effective option for mitigating early paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in breast cancer patients. Further large-scale studies with longer follow-up are warranted to confirm these findings and explore effects across different chemotherapy regimens.

    "Abstract": "Objective To develop and validate a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for ciprofol in elderly surgical patients, delineating its pharmacokinetic profile and concentration-effect relationship to inform precision dosing. Methods Twenty patients (aged ≥65 years) undergoing elective surgery were enrolled. We performed population PK/PD analysis using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling on 386 arterial blood samples and synchronized Bispectral Index (BIS) data. A linear three-compartment model and a sigmoid Emax model described the PK and PD (BIS), respectively. Covariates (age, weight, gender, and laboratory parameters) were tested via stepwise selection. Model performance was evaluated using goodness-of-fit plots, bootstrap ( n = 1,000), and prediction-corrected visual predictive checks. Dosing regimens were optimized via Monte Carlo simulation. Results A three-compartment model best described the PK. The center volume (V 1 ) was generally approximated at 2.95 L, but the peripheral volumes (V 2 and V 3 ) were 45.15 L and 76.79 L, respectively. The clearance (CL) was assessed at 1.01 L min -1 . Body weight and age significantly influenced CL. PD analysis showed rapid effect-site equilibration (K e0 : 1.09 min -1 ), with an EC 50 of 233.91 ng mL -1 and a Hill coefficient of 3.00. No covariates significantly affected PD parameters. The model exhibited sufficient fit and strong predictive efficacy. The simulation results confirmed that administering an intravenous loading dose of 0.4 mg kg -1 over 1 min, followed by an initial continuous infusion at a rate of 0.6 mg kg -1 ·h -1 for 2 h, could stably maintain the patients’ BIS values within the target range of 40–60. Conclusion A population PK/PD model for ciprofol in elderly patients was successfully established and validated. The model supports optimized, individualized dosing to achieve target anesthesia depth in this population.",

    "Abstract": "With the rapid development of electronic networks, consumer online purchasing behavior data presents massive growth and diverse characteristics. How to accurately predict purchasing behavior based on big data analysis becomes the key to improving the quality and efficiency of consumer services. Introducing deep learning methods into purchase prediction research, this paper proposes entity embedding-convolutional neural network-convolutional block attention module (EE-CNN-CBAM) for predicting consumer network purchasing behavior. By entity embedding (EE), high cardinality categorical variables are transformed into low dimensional dense vectors to reduce the computational cost of big data. Using convolutional neural network (CNN) as the core, local association patterns are extracted from user behavior sequences to capture implicit features of consumer online purchasing behavior. And based on the time series data of consumer online purchasing behavior, the characteristic indicators of purchasing behavior patterns are constructed. Convolutional block attention module (CBAM) adjusts channel attention adaptively, allowing the model to prioritize and reinforce the expression of important purchasing behavior features. The experimental results show that EE-CNN-CBAM improves the prediction accuracy on large scale consumer network purchase datasets, providing effective support for consumer behavior prediction in big data environment.",

    "Abstract": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) group communication plays a crucial role in collaborative UAV operations, yet its security faces numerous challenges. Authentication and key agreement protocols, as core technologies for securing UAV communications, have significant research value. In the context of UAV group communication, this paper introduces a dynamic authentication and group key negotiation protocol leveraging elliptic curve signature techniques. By incorporating group key agreement techniques, the proposed protocol offloads complex key computation tasks to the cluster controller, thereby effectively alleviating the problem of limited UAV computational resources and significantly improving overall system efficiency. The proposed protocol supports dynamic joining and leaving of UAV groups, ensuring essential security properties such as backward secrecy and forward secrecy, thus guaranteeing the security and adaptability of group communication. Based on the random oracle model, this paper employs formal security proofs to verify the protocol’s security and further demonstrates through informal security analysis that it can effectively resist both active and passive attacks. Performance evaluation results show that the proposed protocol outperforms existing schemes in terms of computational and communication overhead, achieving both efficiency and security, making it suitable for resource-constrained UAV group communication environments with broad application prospects.",

    "Abstract": "Objective The aim is to systematically assess the impact of resistance exercise on patients diagnosed with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Methods Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on resistance exercise for MASLD/NAFLD were sourced from PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and CNKI databases, (covering all entries from inception to 18 March 2025. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was utilized for quality evaluation, and RevMan 5.3 software was used for conducting the meta-analysis. Results Eleven RCTs, involving 395 participants, were included in the analysis. The meta-analysis revealed that alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were significantly decreased (MD = −4.44 U/L, 95% CI = −8.84 to −0.03, Z = 1.98, P = 0.05). No significant difference was observed in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (MD = −0.18 U/L, 95% CI = −6.70 to 6.34, Z = 0.05, P = 0.96). Among the eight imaging assessment studies, seven reported substantial reductions in liver fat content, whereas one study indicated no effect. No significant difference in clinical compliance was detected between the groups (RR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.89 to 1.10, P = 0.92), and no serious adverse events were documented. Conclusion Resistance exercise notably enhances ALT levels and hepatic steatosis in patients with MASLD. The recommended minimum effective dosage is whole-body multi-muscle training, consisting of 8–10 exercises at 60%–80% of one-repetition maximum (1RM) intensity, performed at least three times weekly for a minimum of 12 weeks. This intervention is particularly advantageous for patients with elevated ALT levels who are unable to tolerate aerobic exercise, and it appears to be safe. Nonetheless, further research involving larger sample sizes is required to confirm its long-term efficacy.

    "Abstract": "Patients with severe myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) are bedridden and suffer from hypersensitivities to light and noise, severe orthostatic intolerance reducing cerebral blood flow, and skeletal muscle symptoms, including loss of force, fatigue, pain, fasciculations, and cramps. Because neurological investigations exclude neuronal causes of myasthenia, we hypothesize a muscular pathomechanism. In previous articles, we considered insufficient activity of the Na + /K + -ATPase to be the main cause of mitochondrial damage via high intracellular sodium that reverses the transport mode of the sodium-calcium-exchanger to import calcium, causing calcium overload. Low Na + /K + -ATPase activity also causes sarcolemmal depolarization, leading to less effective action potential propagation and loss of force. Depolarization brings the membrane potential closer to the threshold potential, causing hyperexcitability that explains fasciculations and cramps. These increase sodium influx during excitation to further increase the workload of Na + /K + -ATPase. Thereby, depolarization causes further depolarization. Higher intracellular sodium favors calcium overload and mitochondrial damage, which lowers the energy supply of Na + /K + -ATPase and increases the reactive oxygen species, further inhibiting Na + /K + -ATPase. The muscle is in a state of depolarization even at rest. Depolarization and mitochondrial damage reinforce each other. Thus, dysfunction of Na + /K + -ATPase as a single mechanism can explain the different skeletal muscle symptoms of severely ill ME/CFS patients, comprising loss of force, fatigue, and fasciculations.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Ethanolic extracts of Viscum album L. (European mistletoe), known as mother tinctures (VAMTs), have been used in traditional medicine to treat hypertension and cardiovascular diseases. However, the underlying biological mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Methods This study investigated the cytotoxic, and cardiovascular effects of ten VAMTs prepared from fresh plants harvested in summer and winter. The extracts were derived from three subspecies ( V. album subsp. album, abietis, and austriacum ) growing five distinct host tree species. Cytotoxicity and oxidative stress were assessed in vitro , while the effects on Na + /K + -ATPase activity and expression were evaluated in porcine renal proximal tubular cells. Additionally, vascular effects were investigated in perfused mesenteric vascular beds of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Results and Discussion Our data demonstrated that VAMTs exhibit no cytotoxic effects, except for the VAMT derived from Quercus petraea , and do not induce oxidative stress in in vitro assays. Regarding molecular targets, distinct profiles were observed: the VAMT derived from A. alba (summer harvest) reduced Na + /K + - ATPase expression and activity in the cellular model, whereas all winter VAMTs reduced only the expression of this enzyme. The winter VAMT from P. sylvestris (VAMT PW) elicited vasodilation in resistance arteries from hypertensive rats. This vasodilatory effect appears to be mediated by the nitric oxide/soluble guanylate cyclase/cyclic guanosine monophosphate signalling pathway and the subsequent activation of small conductance calcium-activated potassium channels. These data support the efficacy of VAMT PW and emphasise the impact of the host tree and season for optimizing antihypertensive potential of V. album samples in the context of traditional mistletoe medicine.",

However, the effects of acupuncture on dCA have never been reported and whether acupuncture at GB34 can improve dCA is unknown. Methods A self-controlled interventional study was conducted. Each participant randomly received two acupuncture interventions, including active acupuncture and sham acupuncture. Transcranial Doppler and servo-controlled finger photoplethysmography were used to record continuous cerebral blood flow velocity in the bilateral middle cerebral arteries and continuous blood pressure to assess dCA with transfer function analysis during acupuncture intervention. Results Twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled. The left and right phase values in the low-frequency band after acupuncture treatment were significantly higher than baseline levels. Meanwhile, a reduction in heart rate was observed after acupuncture treatment. In contrast, no real-time changes were observed in any parameters after sham acupuncture intervention.

Methods We investigated the cellular response to oxidative (menadione) and genotoxic (doxorubicin) stress in two TP53-mutated endometrial cancer cell lines, AN3CA and KLE. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and the expression of antioxidant-related genes (SESN2, SESN3, SOD1) were assessed using qPCR and In-Cell Western assays. Results AN3CA cells showed greater sensitivity to doxorubicin, marked by increased ROS and reduced viability, while KLE cells were more susceptible to menadione-induced toxicity. Protein expression analysis revealed a biphasic response: low doses of doxorubicin transiently increased SESN and SOD1 expression, whereas higher doses suppressed them. Gene expression at the mRNA level did not always correlate with protein levels, suggesting possible post-transcriptional regulation. Conclusion Our findings demonstrate cell line - specific redox responses and identify SESN2, SESN3, and SOD1 as key players in the antioxidant defense network. These genes may serve as potential therapeutic targets in aggressive, hormone-independent endometrial cancers.",

Results SpO 2 accuracy was maintained across altitudes, with RMSE of 0.19%–0.81%, within the ISO 80601-2-61:2017 threshold (≤3%). BP showed wider limits of agreement with a persistent negative bias. SBP in Migrants at 2,560 m exceeded ISO 81060-2:2018 criteria for both bias (−5.29 mmHg) and SD (9.88 mmHg; threshold ≤8 mmHg). DBP bias in Migrants at 4,014 m also exceeded the ±5 mmHg threshold (−5.28 mmHg). No significant differences in measurement error were found between Migrants and Residents or between Han and Zang ethnicities after FDR correction, though error variability was markedly higher in acutely exposed individuals (variance ratio up to 17.5 for SpO 2 ). Conclusion Smartwatch SpO 2 readings remained within ISO benchmark thresholds, supporting trend monitoring utility. BP readings showed specific deviations from ISO criteria during acute exposure and warrant cautious interpretation above 2,500 m.",

    "Abstract": "Energy crops encompass a diverse array of plant species cultivated primarily as a source of biomass for energy generation and biofuel production. As such, they play a pivotal role in the transition to sustainable energy systems. However, their productivity is often limited by environmental stresses, nutrient availability, and the need for optimized yield. While traditional breeding and genetic engineering have driven improvements, challenges such as narrow genetic diversity, long development cycles, trait instability, and unexpected gene interactions remain. Epigenetics offers a largely untapped opportunity to overcome these constraints by regulating gene expression through mechanisms that are dynamic, finely tuned, and responsive to environmental and developmental cues. Epigenetic modifications including DNA methylation, histone post-translational changes, and small non-coding RNAs influence nearly all aspects of plant development and physiology, including traits central to bioenergy crops. While these mechanisms are well characterized in model species such as Arabidopsis thaliana , they remain underexplored in many purpose-grown energy crops. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of epigenetic regulation in bioenergy species, explores how these mechanisms can be leveraged to enhance crop resilience and productivity, and identifies gaps in our understanding. By characterizing epigenetic mechanisms and harnessing epigenetic variation, we can expand the toolkit for developing resilient, high-yielding bioenergy crops to meet future environmental and energy demands.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Extensive research has been conducted on water- limited irrigation strategies and yield component variations in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). However, limited understanding exists regarding the nuanced responses of winter wheat canopies and gene expressions to rehydration events. Methods A field investigation was carried out throughout the winter wheat growing season from 2018 to 2020. Four distinct irrigation schedules were implemented, with water supplementation carefully synchronized with irrigation timing to match the appearance of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth leaves. Further investigation into the molecular mechanisms of winter wheat rehydration using RNA- seq and ultra- performance liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry (UPLC- MS). Results and discussion Our findings show that delayed rehydration results in reduced total water use across all treatment groups during the reproductive growth period, especially from jointing to flowering. A consistent pattern of reduction was observed in leaf area index (LAI), biomass at maturity (BAM), and plant height as rehydration was progressively delayed. The analysis found no statistically significant differences in phenotypic traits among winter wheat at the four- leaf stage before irrigation. In contrast, delaying rehydration until the fifth- leaf stage in spring had a noticeable impact on phenotypic traits. Implementing delayed rehydration at the four- leaf stage increased grain yield by 8. 31% to 51.23. 23%, mainly through three key yield components: more spikes, optimized grains per spike, and higher 1000- grain weight. Interestingly, the increase in 1000- grain weight was inversely related to total grain quantity after postponed rehydration. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses showed that postponed rehydration was associated with flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. Notably, the gene related to dihydrokaempferol- known to be involved in phenylpropanoid, flavonol, and flavone biosynthesis- showed a significant positive correlation with naringenin, chrysin, taxifolin, and prunin. Chlorogenic acid and luteolin also exhibited strong positive correlations with various agronomic traits, such as kernel number and 1000- grain weight. These results suggest the presence of a potential molecular regulator at a critical developmental stage, offering new insights into the mechanisms influencing crop yield under water- restricted irrigation conditions.",

    "Abstract": "High demand for agricultural products together with the changing climate imposes an urgency for improving crop productivity and quality. The Brassica family has evolved as a globally significant oilseed crop due to its multifaceted application for edible oils, seed meals, and biodiesel production. However, its wide-scale crop production is limited due to the advent of several external stressors. Development of resilient Brassica crops requires recognition of the chromatin state complexes to fine tune the transcriptional machinery. Epigenetic modification through DNA methylation, histone modification, RNA directed gene silencing, and chromatin remodeling plays a major role in modulating flowering time, gametogenesis, embryogenesis, seed development and whole genome duplication to shape key agronomical traits. In conjunction, recent progress in the field of sequencing technologies and genome editing have led to the characterization of key epigenetic markers for identifying crucial agronomic traits and subsequent molecular designing. Therefore, the current review details the mechanism and application of the recent epigenetic approaches that have contributed for the generation of climate-smart Brassica family.",

    "Abstract": "Plant membrane transporters are essential components in the regulation of nutrient uptake, ion homeostasis, and adaptive responses to environmental stress. These transport processes are tightly coordinated by complex phytohormonal signaling networks. This review provides an in-depth examination of the molecular mechanisms through which major plant hormones including auxins, cytokinins, brassinosteroids, ethylene, abscisic acid, gibberellins, jasmonates, strigolactones, melatonin, karrikins, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulate transporter activity. Each hormone activates distinct signaling pathways that alter the transcription, localization, and functional dynamics of membrane transport proteins, enabling plants to fine-tune physiological responses in accordance with developmental needs and environmental stimuli. Special attention is given to the integration of hormonal signals and how this interplay governs key processes such as stomatal movement, nutrient transport, and hormonal cross-regulation. The review also highlights the role of hormone–transporter crosstalk in optimizing plant performance under both normal growth conditions and various abiotic or biotic stresses. By dissecting these regulatory mechanisms, we offer insights into how phytohormonal control of membrane transport contributes to overall plant fitness. Understanding the coordination between hormonal signaling and transporter networks opens new avenues for crop improvement strategies. Leveraging this knowledge can support the development of resilient plant varieties with enhanced nutrient use efficiency, stress tolerance, and yield potential. This review underscores the significance of transporter–hormone interactions as central elements in plant development and environmental adaptation, positioning them as key targets for future agricultural innovations.",

    "Abstract": "The plant microbiome is essential for plant health; in particular, synthetic microbial communities (SynComs) offer a scalable, sustainable alternative to chemical pesticides. The concept has moved beyond single-strain inoculants, with SynComs being rationally designed using ecological principles, computational tools, and an understanding of how plants shape their microbial niche through root exudates and chemotaxis. Indeed, effective SynCom design requires a mechanistic understanding of microbe–microbe and host–microbe interactions. In real field settings, SynComs have been shown to suppress diseases in tomato, rice, wheat, and maize while enhancing yield. Inconsistent field performance, instability in formulation, regulatory challenges, and farmer adoption are among the pressing issues related to SynComs. In the foreseeable future, the integration of machine learning and gene-editing tools is expected to enable SynCom formulation with greater precision and impact.

    "Abstract": "Holm oak ( Quercus ilex L.) decline in Mediterranean forests is mostly driven by the synergistic effects of drought and Phytophthora cinnamomi , yet effective protection strategies remain elusive. Previously, we reported that elicitation of holm oak embryogenic lines with 50 µM methyl jasmonate (MeJA), did not impair somatic embryo growth and development while inducing jasmonic acid (JA) and phenolic compounds accumulation, also resulting in increased H 2 O 2 levels and further JA production after challenged against active oomycete mycelium. Here, we evaluate the proteomic profile in the E00 embryogenic line of Q. ilex in response to this priming treatment and subsequent pathogen inoculation. To this end, embryogenic cultures were first treated with a solution of 0 or 50 µM MeJA for three days and five days later, inoculated or not with a P. cinnamomi mycelia extract. Twenty-four hours post-inoculation, samples were harvested, proteins extracted from the four treatments, and analysed by nano-LC-MS/MS on an Orbitrap Fusion. SEQUEST searches against a translated Q. ilex transcriptome identified 3,205 protein species with high confidence. Multivariate sparse PLS-DA captured 68.9% of variance and clearly discriminated between treatments, particularly separating inoculated from non-inoculated samples. MeJA elicitation led to the accumulation of proteins associated with cell-wall biogenesis, carbon metabolism, and amino-acid and phenylpropanoids biosynthesis. Some of these proteins were also accumulated, but to a lesser extent, by pathogen inoculation in non-elicited cultures. Notably, 24 hours after inoculation, MeJA – elicited samples showed enhanced abundance of proteins hormone-signalling and redox enzymes, including cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, glutathione S-transferases, calreticulin, thaumatin-like proteins, catalase and chitinase. These results revealed that MeJA elicitation induced a primed state in Q. ilex embryogenic lines, reprograming the proteome to enhance early defence and oxidative stress response pathways upon P. cinnamomi e inoculation. This supports MeJA priming as a promising biotechnological strategy to improve holm oak resilience and productivity complementing integrated pest management and breeding strategies.",

    "Abstract": "One of the main challenges in agriculture is the increasing demand to enhance plant yield per hectare. This is crucial not only for boosting food production to support a growing global population but also for minimizing land use for agricultural purposes. Seed yield is of particular importance since seeds are the primary source of carbohydrates and oil. The number of seeds that develop per plant is influenced by various factors, among which inflorescence architecture is a key trait. The geometrical organization of the inflorescence, known as phyllotaxis, plays an important role during reproductive development across many species. Despite its significance, the molecular mechanisms underlying phyllotactic patterning are still not fully understood. Recently, we demonstrated that the REM genes AtREM34 and AtREM35 are important in establishing phyllotactic patterns in Arabidopsis inflorescences. In this study, we investigated the genetic relationship between these two REM transcription factor genes and a closely related member, AtREM36 . Interestingly, we show that double mutants of these genes display an increased number of siliques produced on the main stem. To explore the translational potential of this finding in the economically important seed crop Brassica napus (rapeseed), we identified and functionally analyzed, through complementation tests, a set of homologous BnaREM genes. This application-driven study uncovers novel genes associated with phyllotaxis and yield in the Brassicaceae family, contributing to our understanding of plant architecture and offering insights into sustainable strategies for crop improvement.",

    "Abstract": "Soil borne pathogen, Phytophthora nicotianae causes black shank disease in tobacco, present a pervasive threat to global agriculture, with conventional control strategies often proving inadequate. A critical gap exists in our understanding of the long-term, dynamic interplay between the pathogen and the soil microbiome. To address this, we conducted a six-year longitudinal metagenomic study in a monocultured tobacco field, revealing a pathobiome in constant, non-equilibrium adaptation. Our analysis uncovered profound microbial restructuring, beginning with cumulative transcriptional reprogramming of highly significant genes. Functional profiling showed a critical metabolic shift toward anabolic capacity, with a 66.7% increase in KEGG orthologs and enrichment of amino acid biosynthesis (+8.9%), ribosomes (+13.0%), and quorum sensing (+11.0%). The soil resistome underwent dramatic succession, featuring an initial coordinated defense (R²=0.825), a comprehensive collapse in Year 3-4 (917 downregulated genes), and a resilient recovery that drove a net increase in antibiotic resistance, indicating a lasting ecosystem alteration. Virulence factor evolution revealed strategic trade-offs, with flagella systems dominating (2,583 occurrences) while more costly energy consuming secretion systems declined, and 87 core virulence factors persisted across time. Crucially, we observed a widespread decoupling between genetic potential and functional expression; key categories for defense and signal transduction declined in abundance (slopes of -150.4 and -264.9, respectively) despite stable gene counts, suggesting a systemic, energy conserving survival strategy. Concurrently, the community experienced progressive diversity loss (Shannon index slope = -0.0464/yr at genus level) despite maintained species richness (717 species), indicating restructuring was driven by shifting evenness rather than species loss. Our findings exhibit that persistent pathogen pressure drives the soil microbiome into a continuous state of adaptive restructuring, prioritizing coordinated defensiveness and metabolic efficiency over stability. This time resolved framework challenges static views of soil ecosystems and provides a foundational dataset for developing predictive, microbiome informed strategies to manage soil borne diseases sustainably.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Wetting-drying cycles significantly influence soil hydro-mechanical properties, thereby playing a crucial role in the assessment of geological hazards. However, their effects on the infiltration potential of vegetated clayey soils remain poorly understood. Methods This study examined low-plasticity clay in experimental boxes with four treatments ( Cynodon dactylon , Lolium perenne , Festuca arundinacea , and an unplanted control), each with three replicates. Following five wetting-drying cycles, desiccation crack patterns, soil aggregation, hydraulic parameters, pore-water distribution, and infiltration characteristics were systematically quantified at each cycle. Results Grass species significantly enhanced fine particle aggregation and effectively suppressed desiccation crack formation during the alternate wetting-drying processes. Bare soils exhibited progressive decreases in adsorbed/movable water ratio, saturated moisture content, and residual moisture content with the successive wetting-drying cycles, whereas opposite trends were observed in vegetated soils. After five wetting-drying cycles, the stable infiltration rate of bare soils improved significantly (83.17 ± 5.19%), and that of vegetated soils were lower (7.69%–18.06%). The increased permeability of bare soils is primarily controlled by the variations of movable/adsorbed water ratio and the dimensionless soil-water characteristic curves parameter (α) induced by the wetting-drying cycles, whereas in vegetated soils, this enhancement results from the persistent effects of roots on soil physicochemical properties. Discussion The presence of grass species effectively mitigates the influence of wetting-drying cycles on the infiltration potential of clayey soil, this can serve as a reference for ecological measures of engineering slope or soil waste landfill.",

    "Abstract": "Different wet processing conditions generate changes in the quality characteristics of the coffee beans. Currently, the primary sources of these changes are the exocarp and mesocarp, and processing times are increased before pulping and during the fermentation of mucilage for this purpose. This research evaluated the mycotoxin contents of fruit at three different stages of maturity (MS1, MS2, and MS3), subjected to times and two temperatures of 15 and 20°C, under fruit reserve and prolonged fermentation conditions. No significant differences were detected at the maturity stage, with ochratoxin values of 2.89, 2.98, and 3.03 μg/kg for MS1, MS2, and MS3, respectively, and the average aflatoxin concentrations were 0.13 μg/kg, 0.14 μg/kg and 0.15 μg/kg, respectively. For the fruit reserve treatments associated with stages MS1, MS2 and MS3, the ochratoxin contents were 3.05, 3.19 and 3.27 μg/kg, respectively. The maximum observed for the reserve treatments was 3.31 μg/kg in MS3, with a temperature of 20°C and a reserve time of 48 hours. The maximum average value observed for the treatments with prolonged fermentation was 3.51 μg/kg in MS2, with a temperature of 20°C and a prolonged fermentation time of 20 hours. These values indicate that regardless of processing delays, the initial quality of the fruit is critical to ensure the safety of the bean. The elimination of dry and defective fruit through different classifications followed by continuous drying prevents the development of the conditions necessary for the generation of mycotoxins.",

    "Abstract": "Deep learning has recently shown strong potential in crop row detection for navigation line extraction. However, existing approaches often rely on dataset-specific customization and extensive image preprocessing, limiting their practicality in real-world agricultural scenarios. In contrast, human operators can instinctively navigate machinery by simply following the central crop row. Inspired by this observation, we propose a novel strategy that directly extracts the central crop row as the navigation line. To support this paradigm, we introduce a three-class annotation scheme—background, vegetation, and central crop row—where the vegetation class serves as an auxiliary supervisory signal to provide structural constraints and guide accurate localization. A consistent annotation width of crop row is applied across all samples to enable the model to learn invariant structural features. We develop CCRDNet (Central Crop Row Detection Network), which predicts the central row position and subsequently fits the navigation line using the least-squares method. A dataset of 7,367 images comprising eight crop types across diverse environments was collected, yet only 400 images—from two crop types in eight environments—were used for training. Despite the limited supervision, the proposed method achieved a navigation line extraction accuracy of 95.57% with an average angle error of 1.13°. CCRDNet is lightweight, requiring only 0.033M parameters, and operates at 86.76 FPS on an RTX 3060 GPU and 48.78 FPS on a Jetson Orin NX. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach not only simplifies the navigation pipeline but also enables zero-shot generalization across previously unseen environments, fully satisfying the real-time requirements of agricultural machinery.",

    "Abstract": "Kiwifruit ( Actinidia spp.) is an economically important horticultural crop, yet functional genomics and molecular breeding efforts remain limited by low transformation efficiency, particularly in recalcitrant genotypes. In this study, Agrobacterium -mediated transformation systems were established and systematically optimized for Actinidia chinensis and Actinidia valvata . The optimized Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 system achieved a 24% transformation efficiency in A. chinensis leaf explants, enabling complete plant regeneration within five months. In contrast, A. valvata showed only 4% efficiency, and its transformed call failed to initiate shoot organogenesis. To overcome this limitation, Agrobacterium rhizogenes K599-based methods were developed. The tissue culture system induced transgenic hairy roots at a rate of 68.7% without exogenous hormones, while a tissue culture-free protocol based on high-pressure propagation of woody stems reduced the transformation cycle to 4–5 weeks with 50% efficiency. Stable transgene integration and expression were confirmed by GFP fluorescence, PCR, and sequencing. Collectively, these transformation systems provide rapid, efficient, and reproducible tools that will substantially advance gene functional studies and molecular breeding in different kiwifruit species.",

Genetic mapping via bulked segregant analysis (BSA) mapped the apricot-flowered trait to a single dominant locus within a 9.76-Mb interval on chromosome B03. Among the 1,406 annotated genes in this region, Production of Anthocyanin Pigment 2 ( BjB03.PAP2 ), which encodes an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, emerged as the most likely candidate gene. Consistent with this, transcriptomic analysis revealed coordinated upregulation of multiple structural genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway in the apricot-flowered variant. Further sequence analysis revealed a (TC) n dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the promoter of BjB03.PAP2 , representing a structural variation that is likely responsible for enhanced transcriptional activity and subsequent anthocyanin production in petals. This study unveils a previously unrecognized genetic mechanism underlying flower color variation in B. juncea , offering new insights into the evolution of floral pigmentation and a valuable genetic resource for breeding ornamental Brassica crops.",

    "Abstract": "Excessive fertilization poses a major threat to sustainable agriculture, resulting in resource waste and environmental degradation. The ecological composite fertilizer (ECF) combined with fertilizer reduction represents a promising strategy to improve rhizosphere microbial diversity in wheat systems. A field experiment, containing six treatments, namely traditional compound fertilizer (TF, applied at the conventional rate) with a 10% reduction (TF90), TF90 plus ECF application (TF90+ECF), TF with a 15% reduction (TF85), TF85 plus ECF application (TF85+ECF), TF with a 20% reduction (TF80), and TF80 plus ECF application (TF80+ECF), was conducted to explore the influences of fertilizer reduction combined with ECF application on wheat yield and rhizosphere soil microbial diversity. Results showed that the TF85+ECF treatment achieved the highest wheat yield at 8,717.33 kg ha −1 , which was significantly greater than all other treatments and represented a 30.63% increase over the TF85 treatment. The TF85+ECF group significantly enhanced the activities of the carbon and nitrogen cycling enzymes β-1, 4-glucosidase glucosidase (BG) and urease (UE), and increased the abundances of the functional genes cbbLR and amoA . In the +ECF treatment groups (TF90+ECF, TF85+ECF, and TF80+ECF), linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) and specialization-occupancy (SPEC-OCCU) analyses identified keystone microbial taxa, including positively correlated taxa with biocontrol and metabolic versatility (e.g., Trichoderma, Solicoccozyma ) and negatively correlated potential pathogens (e.g., Alternaria ). Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that the TF85+ECF group streamlined bacterial network architecture while enhanced fungal network complexity and connectivity. Mantel tests and correlation analyses indicated that soil organic carbon, BG activity, and cbbLR gene abundance were significantly linked to microbial community structure, and keystone taxa were strongly correlated with soil nutrient cycling functions. Our findings provide a microbiome-based strategy and a novel perspective for sustainable wheat production and targeted microbial management in agriculture.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction This study examines how social support from parents, educators, and peers influences psychological factors—self-efficacy, self-worth, and intrinsic motivation—and how these, in turn, affect music performance anxiety (MPA) among vocal music students. It aims to identify both direct and indirect pathways through which social and psychological variables interact to shape MPA. Methods A total of 526 vocal music students from China participated in this study, with a balanced gender distribution (51.3% male, 48.7% female) and educational levels (55.3% undergraduates, 44.7% postgraduates), ranging in age from 20 to 35 years. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypothesised model, incorporating multi-group analysis to explore gender-based differences in pathways. Results Findings confirmed that self-efficacy, self-worth, and intrinsic motivation significantly mediated the relationship between social support and MPA. Gender differences emerged in the strength and significance of these pathways, with female students showing stronger indirect effects, particularly through self-worth and intrinsic motivation. Discussion This study validates the theoretical model, highlighting the importance of both social and psychological resources in managing performance anxiety. While the mediating role of self-efficacy aligns with existing research, the inclusion of self-worth and intrinsic motivation provides new insights into gender-sensitive dynamics of MPA. These findings offer practical implications for educators and policymakers in designing gender-responsive support strategies for vocal music students.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction This study aimed to investigate the associations among social participation, sleep quality, multidimensional frailty, and activities of daily living (ADL) in older adults with knee osteoarthritis (KOA), and to further evaluate whether sleep quality and frailty jointly mediate these relationships. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 288 older adults with KOA recruited via convenience sampling. Validated scales were used to assess social participation, sleep quality, multidimensional frailty, and ADL. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0 and the PROCESS 4.1 macro, including descriptive statistics, correlation analyses, and mediation modeling. Results Social participation was significantly associated with sleep quality, multidimensional frailty, and ADL (all p &amp;lt; 0.001). Sleep quality was significantly associated with frailty and ADL, and frailty was also associated with ADL. Mediation analysis indicated that sleep quality and frailty each partially mediated the association between social participation and ADL, and jointly formed a significant chain mediation pathway. The combined indirect effect was 0.315, accounting for 42.51% of the total effect. Discussion Social participation was significantly associated with ADL in older adults with KOA, both directly and indirectly through sleep quality and multidimensional frailty. These findings suggest that enhancing social engagement and addressing sleep and frailty issues may be important for maintaining functional independence in this population. Future longitudinal and interventional studies are needed to validate these findings and inform targeted strategies for improving daily functioning among older adults with KOA.",

    "Abstract": "Classical psychoanalysis has traditionally focused on uncovering unconscious conflicts through language—the so-called `talking cure`. However, contemporary research underscores the importance of embodied simulation, body language, and their symbolic representation in understanding and addressing patient’s somatic symptoms. This occurs particularly when individuals seeking psychological help are unable to use spoken words to express their feelings, which is why communication between patient and therapist takes place at a pre-verbal level, within the space of “intercorporeality.” In this paper we explore the interplay between early development, mentalization, language acquisition and somatic disorders as failures of symbolization that manifest in bodily distress. In psychoanalytic psychotherapy these processes can be studied as transference-countertransference interactions. We describe the observed clinical phenomena in terms of intersubjective communication grounded in embodied simulation theory, showing how bodily symptoms emerge when mentalization fails and countertransference is enacted at a concrete, somatic level. For this, a clinical vignette illustrates how severe deficits in mentalization produce concrete somatic enactments and embodied countertransference in the therapist, suggesting a neurobiological substrate in pathological intersubjective resonance. We also compare a clinical vignette to human interaction with an AI as a vivid illustration of what happens when there is ‘nobody’ (or ‘no body’) as a human counterpart in communication. LLMs lack bodily resonance and therefore cannot substitute for the therapeutic processes that rely on embodied simulation. Thus, our paper describes phenomenological observations of interbody communication in therapy caused by symbolization failure, integrates several theoretical and experimental approaches (intersubjectivity, embodied simulation, interbrain synchronization) to explain it, points at further directions of scientific research and indicates potential dangers for therapists and patients using modern AI technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Background Binge eating is a complex and often underdetected condition characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive food intake accompanied by a perceived loss of control, leading to significant psychological and health consequences. Although pharmacological, psychological, and nutritional treatments are available, their effectiveness remains limited—possibly due to an insufficient understanding of the underlying cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms. Impulsivity, particularly food-specific impulsivity, has been identified as a key factor in binge eating, with inhibitory control deficits associated with increased cravings, maladaptive eating behaviors, and impaired decision-making. Recent studies suggest that inhibitory control training and non-invasive brain stimulation—especially intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting prefrontal regions such as the dorsolateral (dlPFC) or ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)—may offer promising therapeutic effects. However, the combined use of cognitive and neuromodulatory interventions has been scarcely investigated. This study aims to determine the efficacy of iTBS combined with inhibitory control training in individuals with binge eating. Methods and analysis In this double-blind, randomized, controlled trial with parallel groups, 150 individuals with binge eating will be allocated to one of three groups. All participants will undergo inhibitory control training, differing only in the stimulation site: (1) active iTBS of the dlPFC, (2) active iTBS of the vmPFC, or (3) control site vertex stimulation. The interventions will consist of ten sessions over 2 weeks. Primary outcomes will be binge eating symptoms and food craving. Secondary outcomes will include changes in brain activation and connectivity (via fMRI), cognitive functioning, eating behavior, and biological markers. Assessments will be conducted pre-treatment, post-treatment, and at 3-month follow-up. Health service utilization will also be collected to evaluate cost-effectiveness and cost-utility. Discussion The results of this study will contribute to the evidence base for combined cognitive and neuromodulatory interventions aimed at improving eating behavior in individuals with binge eating.

    "Abstract": "Introduction Borderline personality disorder is marked by emotional lability, unstable identity, and hypersensitivity to abandonment. Although mainstream treatments, such as dialectical behavior therapy, schema therapy, and mentalization-based therapy, reduce symptoms, they often bypass the subcortical affective systems shaped by early attachment trauma. This conceptual paper presents triangle therapy for borderline personality disorder, a neuroaffective intervention based on the premise that three ancestral affective conditions—silence, sound, and isolation—are hypothesized to shape autonomic dysregulation in borderline personality disorder. Method Triangle therapy for borderline personality disorder proposes a 30-session protocol involving progressive exposure to each condition over ten sessions. Stimulus duration would increase from 5 to 50 min under continuous therapist attunement without verbal interpretation. The model emphasizes embodied co-regulation to support potential autonomic integration of historically overwhelming affective states. Hypothetical results Potential outcomes may include recalibration of vagal and sympathetic tone, extinction of catastrophic prediction errors, and emergence of symbolic-affective processing. The model integrates polyvagal theory, affective neuroscience, and psychodynamic frameworks on early neglect. Safety protocols and inclusion criteria are specified to support empirical evaluation. Discussion Triangle therapy for borderline personality disorder is a theoretical model proposed to inform future research and clinical development. It is not a replacement for existing evidence-based treatments but is framed as a somatic pre-phase that may improve affective tolerance and therapy engagement. Empirical testing through pilot studies and multimodal physiological assessment is essential before clinical implementation. The protocol aims to provide new opportunities for treating severe affective instability in outpatient and inpatient settings.",

Methods Using latent profiles analysis, 275 bipolar patients were categorized into distinct trauma profiles based on Childhood Trauma Questionnaire scores. The characteristics of sociodemographic, clinical, pharmacological and biochemical variables, as well as objective and subjective cognitive functioning, and quality of life, were compared across profiles and with 63 healthy controls. Results Three distinct profiles emerged: high trauma ( HT, 14.55% ), high neglect ( HN, 30.18% ) and low trauma ( LT, 55.27% ). Compared to healthy controls, all bipolar groups exhibited worse performance on nearly all aspects of objective and subjective cognitive functioning, and quality of life. Both the HT and HN profiles were significantly associated with subjective cognitive functioning. Notably, only the HT profile was significantly associated with objective cognitive functioning, whereas the HN profile was specifically linked to quality of life. Discussion This study highlights multiple childhood trauma profiles in bipolar disorder. Findings reveal that trauma and neglect significantly influence diverse functional and clinical outcomes in bipolar disorder. Further research is crucial to elucidate their impact mechanisms.",

Results We replicated several established effects like physicality was valued in men strongly in the short-term context, and that more psychopathic and narcissistic people chose physicality more often in their long-term mates. Uniquely here, compatibility was more valued in the long-term context especially for women extending more parenting effort when considering short-term relationships and men who were less psychopathic when considering short-term relationships.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study explored the protective role of psychological resilience in children’s sports injury recovery, and verified the chain mediating effect of emotion regulation (cognitive reappraisal, expressive suppression) and sports self-efficacy, to provide empirical evidence for psychological intervention in children’s injury rehabilitation. Methods A total of 128 injured children aged 8–12 years were selected via cluster sampling from the school (March 2024–March 2025). A 6-month follow-up (T0: baseline, T1: 3 months, T2: 6 months) was performed with scales measuring psychological resilience, emotion regulation (child version), sports self-efficacy, and injury recovery progress. SPSS 26.0 was used for descriptive and correlation analyses, and Mplus 8.3 for longitudinal mediation and chain mediation models. Results This study uses longitudinal mediation analysis to explore associative pathways, acknowledging unmeasured confounders may influence results. Baseline resilience was positively correlated with T1/T2 recovery ( r = 0.407, 0.462; both p &amp;lt; 0.001). β = 0.196 is consistently reported for T0 resilience → T1 self-efficacy, but negatively predicted T1 expressive suppression ( β = −0.179, p &amp;lt; 0.05); T1 self-efficacy was positively associated with T2 recovery ( β = 0.372, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Key limitations include single-time-point measurements of resilience (T0 only) and self-efficacy (T1 only), which restrict causal inference. Two chain paths were significant: “resilience → cognitive reappraisal → self-efficacy → recovery” (indirect effect = 0.098, 95% CI = [0.065, 0.131]) and “resilience → expressive suppression → self-efficacy → recovery” (indirect effect = −0.029, 95% CI = [−0.048, −0.012]), with total mediation accounting for 37.9% of total effect. This study uses longitudinal mediation analysis to explore associations, acknowledging unmeasured confounders may influence results. Conclusion Resilience affects recovery via two chains: improving cognitive reappraisal to enhance self-efficacy, and reducing expressive suppression to boost self-efficacy. Cognitive reappraisal is a more positive mediating path and a core target for psychological intervention.",

    "Abstract": "This article aims to explain how emotions arise and operate within the framework of my attention-based theory of consciousness, referred to here as the AME theory of consciousness (Attentional Modulation of Energy). According to the AME theory of consciousness, the phenomenal aspect of consciousness is produced by the modulation of the energy level of the area of the organ of attention (aOA) that underpins our attentional activity. The phenomenal aspect of consciousness, in turn, provides us with a sense of self and informs us about how our activities affect it. It manifests through five main dimensions—qualitative, quantitative, hedonic, temporal, and spatial—each of which can be explained by a specific aspect of the modulation of the energy level of the aOA. Emotions, which represent some of the most informative forms of conscious experience, emerge from the interaction of three main components—core affect, cognitive appraisal processes, and physiological and behavioral manifestations—whose interplay unfolds through cycles of conscious and unconscious processing. They arise when an object elicits an affective response capable of shifting the focus of attention from the object to the sense of self. This shift results in the activation of an aOA related to the sense of self (or to an aspect of it) and leads to the adoption of a corresponding set-point. Deviations from this set-point generate the conscious experience of emotion, which informs the individual about the state of his internal equilibrium and the integrity of his sense of self. Emotions thus act not only as adaptive regulators of behavior but also as fundamental operations through which the individual monitors, defines, and continually reconstructs his sense of self.",

    "Abstract": "Background Innovative instructional approaches are increasingly advocated in physical education to enhance both motor skill development and psychological adaptation. However, few studies have directly compared micro-level (AI-assisted) and macro-level (Big-Unit) teaching models, or examined the psychological mechanisms underlying performance improvements in adolescent winter-sport environments. Methods A three-arm, quasi-experimental longitudinal study was conducted with 129 first-year middle school students (AI-assisted: n = 42; Big-Unit: n = 43; Conventional: n = 44). Participants completed an 8-week speed-skating intervention consisting of 24 on-ice lessons. Learning motivation, self-efficacy, psychological resilience, and related psychological constructs were assessed at baseline (T1), mid-intervention (T2), and post-intervention (T3). Skating performance was evaluated using electronic 500-m timing. Linear mixed-effects models, ANCOVA, and structural equation modeling were applied to assess Group × Time interactions and mediation pathways. Results Both AI-assisted and Big-Unit teaching produced significantly larger improvements in 500-m performance than conventional instruction (AI: −5.59 s; Big-Unit: −7.60 s; Conventional: −1.80 s; all p &amp;lt; 0.001). All 13 psychological outcomes showed strong Group × Time interactions favoring the innovative groups [all χ 2 (4) &amp;gt; 137.28, q &amp;lt; 0.001]. ANCOVA confirmed substantial adjusted Group effects for changes in learning motivation, self-efficacy, psychological resilience, and anxiety/stress (partial η 2 = 0.650–0.927). Mediation analyses identified a statistical suppression pattern, in which increases in learning motivation and self-efficacy served as significant indirect pathways linking innovative instruction to performance gains. However, the direct technical impact remained the dominant driver. Conclusion AI-assisted and Big-Unit teaching substantially enhance both technical performance and psychological functioning in adolescent speed skating. Statistical mediation models support learning motivation as a plausible mechanism linking teaching mode to performance, with self-efficacy providing additional support. These findings highlight the complementary potential of technology-enhanced and mastery-oriented pedagogies to modernize physical education through both direct technical renovation and indirect psychological adaptation.",

    "Abstract": "Objective The Sport Education Model is widely regarded as a structured instructional framework capable of enhancing students’ motor skills, motivation to participate in physical activity, and socio-emotional competence. However, most existing studies focus on college students and major team sports. Empirical evidence for high school populations and individual racket sports such as table tennis remains limited. Methods A quasi-experimental design was employed with two parallel classes from one high school. The experimental group received instruction based on the Sport Education Model, while the control group followed the traditional three-part lesson structure. Both groups experienced the same instructional duration and total class hours. After the intervention, students’ performance was assessed using table tennis skill tests, the Sport Motivation Scale, and the Social Adaptation Questionnaire. Independent-samples t -tests were used to compare post-intervention differences between groups. Results In terms of sport skills, the experimental group showed significantly greater improvements in flat serve and backhand push-drive performance ( p &amp;lt; 0.01), as well as significant gains in forehand attack and half-table two-point forehand drills ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). In sport motivation, the experimental group demonstrated highly significant increases in intrinsic motivation for knowledge, accomplishment, and excitement ( p &amp;lt; 0.01). Identified regulation and external regulation also improved significantly ( p &amp;lt; 0.01), and introjected regulation reached a significant level ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). Regarding social adaptation, the experimental group obtained significantly higher total scores than the control group ( p &amp;lt; 0.01). Conclusion Compared with the traditional teaching model, table tennis instruction based on the Sport Education Model substantially enhanced students’ sport-specific skills, learning motivation, self-efficacy, and social adaptation. These results indicate strong feasibility and practical value for implementing and promoting this instructional approach.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Research on student writing feedback literacy is increasing, but individual learner factors remain underexamined, and most existing studies focus on English learners rather than Japanese learners. This study explores the relationships between Japanese learners’ growth mindset and student writing feedback literacy, as well as the mediating role of achievement goals. Methods Data were collected through a questionnaire completed by 309 Japanese learners in China. The survey assessed growth mindset, achievement goals, and student writing feedback literacy. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and bootstrapped mediation analysis were used to examine the direct and indirect relationships among the variables. Results SEM results revealed that the direct effect of growth mindset on student writing feedback literacy was not significant. Mediation analyses showed that development-approach, development-avoidance, and demonstration-approach goals positively mediated the relationship between growth mindset and student writing feedback literacy, with all indirect effects being statistically significant. Discussion Achievement goals serve as a key mediating mechanism linking Japanese learners’ growth mindset and student writing feedback literacy. Such practices as development-oriented instructional goals and formative assessment may provide a supportive context for fostering a growth mindset and development-focused achievement goals, thereby supporting the development of student writing feedback literacy.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study addresses the unclear dynamic mechanisms underlying social interactions in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by constructing a structured play observation framework. Methods By combining latent class analysis (LCA) and temporal analysis techniques, this study systematically analyzed the heterogeneous characteristics of social behavioral sequences. Using a longitudinal tracking and cross-sectional design, multimodal data (video coding and physiological indicators) were collected from 60 children with ASD and 40 typically developing (TD) children. Results The behavioral sequence complexity of the ASD group was significantly lower than that of the TD group, exhibiting an “avoidance–rigid” cyclical pattern. The LCA model identified three behavioral patterns: high interaction, medium interaction–rigid, and low interaction–high avoidance. The low interaction–high avoidance group demonstrated the poorest intervention response rate. Conclusion This study innovatively applies dynamic systems theory to the ASD field, demonstrating that behavioral sequences can serve as intervention targets. It advances evaluation tools from static description to dynamic prediction, providing a scientific basis for personalized intervention planning. The integration of structured observation and multimodal data analysis deepens the understanding of the dynamic mechanisms underlying social impairments in ASD and holds significant theoretical and practical value.",

    "Abstract": "Aim The adverse health outcomes of schizophrenia (SZ) are largely driven by the high prevalence of other non-neurological diseases. In addition to accelerated brain aging, patients with SZ also exhibit signs of systemic aging. However, the potential causal or biological mechanisms between multisystem aging and schizophrenia remain unknown. Methods We obtained SZ-associated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sets, aging gene data, and tissue-specific cis-expression quantitative trait locus (cis-eQTL) data of the cerebral cortex and other tissues from a previous two-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS), GeneCards database, and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We employed tissue-specific Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to elucidate the tissue-specific expression patterns of aging-related genes, and used the summary data-based MR (SMR) approach to obtain tissue aging-related genes associated with the risk of SZ development. We identified the potential aging-related pathways through which these tissue-specific cis-eQTLs may affect SZ using enrichment analyses. Finally, we explored the relationship between the identified crucial aging-related genes and predicted age difference (PAD) of the brain in our clinical patients. Results We found that the expression of tissue-specific aging genes, including synuclein alpha ( SNCA ), angiotensin I converting enzyme ( ACE ), BRCA1 DNA repair-associated ( BRCA1 ), MutL homolog 1 ( MLH1 ), vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGFA) , microtubule-associated protein tau ( MAPT ), and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 ( ARMS2 ), may affect SZ. The tissue-specific cis-eQTL may influence SZ through aging pathways. The brain PAD was significantly higher in the high-expression group of BRCA1 than in the low-expression group. Conclusions This study provides valuable clues to understand the link between SZ and multiorgan system aging and improves the current understanding of multiple tissue-specific aging-related genes with SZ.",

    "Abstract": "Background Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals face high levels of stigma, discrimination, and psychological distress, which are amplified in carceral settings. Italian prisons have introduced specialized sections for TGD inmates; however, limited empirical evidence exists on their function and the psychiatric, social, and institutional challenges emerging within them. Methods A case-informed qualitative design was applied to four TGD inmates housed in a specialized prison section in Northern Italy. Data were derived from routine psychiatric and endocrinological assessments, administrative documentation, informal and semi-structured interviews, and multidisciplinary team observations. A thematic cross-case synthesis was conducted to identify institutional determinants of distress and barriers to gender-affirming care. Results Three themes emerged. (1) Context-dependent fluidity in gender identity recognition and categorization: institutional frameworks relied on static binary models, contributing to confusion and psychological strain. (2) Intra-group tensions within designated housing: discrepancies in transition pathways, administrative criteria, perceived authenticity, and the presence of sexual minority inmates generated conflict and social exclusion. (3) Gaps in gender-affirming and psychiatric care: logistical barriers, limited staff training, reliance on telemedicine, and inconsistent access to hormone therapy disrupted continuity of care and exacerbated distress. Discussion These findings illustrate how rigid systems and ambiguous housing policies may reinforce minority stress and undermine psychiatric well-being. Protective units can inadvertently reproduce exclusion when gender identity and sexual orientation are conflated or when criteria for placement remain unclear. Correctional systems should adopt flexible gender-recognition procedures, implement trauma-informed practices, develop distinct housing policies, establish standardized pathways for gender-affirming care, and provide specialized staff training to ensure dignity, safety, and improved mental health outcomes for TGD inmates.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study aimed to examine the potential psychological mechanisms that may link childhood psychological maltreatment to loneliness among Chinese college students by testing a dual-path mediation model involving trust in others and positive coping styles. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 603 college students using self-report measures of childhood psychological maltreatment, trust in others, positive coping styles, and loneliness. Data were analyzed using correlation analysis and structural equation modeling with bootstrapping. Results Childhood psychological maltreatment was positively correlated with loneliness and negatively correlated with trust in others and positive coping. Trust in others and positive coping styles were negatively correlated with loneliness. The structural equation model revealed significant indirect effects: childhood maltreatment was associated with loneliness both through reduced trust in others (indirect effect = 0.063, 12.07% of total effect) and through weakened positive coping styles (indirect effect = 0.084, 16.19% of total effect). The total indirect effect accounted for 28.26% of the total variance. Conclusion The findings support the proposed dual-path model, suggesting that the association between childhood psychological maltreatment and later loneliness may operate through eroded interpersonal trust and impaired development of adaptive coping strategies. This underscores the importance of integrated interventions targeting both trust reconstruction and coping skills training in mitigating the long-term impacts of early adversity.",

    "Abstract": "Substance use disorder (SUD) poses significant challenges to public health, the economy, and social safety. Delay discounting (DD) is one form of impulsivity which is a risk factor for SUD and other mental health disorders. Moreover, when faced with immediate rewards, individuals with SUD exhibit increased DD compared to healthy controls. Fortunately, previous studies have shown that EFT, referring to vividly imagining potential future events in specific scenarios based on an individual’s current experiences, can effectively reduce DD and substance use in individuals with SUD. In this process, the potential regulatory mechanism of EFT may involve extending the temporal window and decreasing the construal level of future events. Most promising avenues to pursue in future studies may include manipulating participants’ factors (e.g., sample size, adherence to diagnostic criteria, comorbidity with other mental diseases), conducting longitudinal studies and exploring the neural regulatory mechanisms of EFT on DD among individuals with SUD. Further research should also examine the effects of both positive and negative emotional valence in EFT interventions to determine how different types of future thinking influence impulsivity and decision-making. This would help us develop more applicable theoretical models and improve the effectiveness of EFT in intervening with SUD.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study aims to bridge the existing gap in knowledge by assessing the financial impact of image-guided brachytherapy (IGBT) in the management of cervical cancer in Thailand. Methods A web-based questionnaire was developed in 2019 to collect data from 14 radiotherapy centers across all regions of Thailand. The survey gathered information on the use of brachytherapy for cervical cancer treatment, encompassing both conventional brachytherapy (point-based prescription) and IGBT (volume-based prescription). Data on infrastructure, workforce, and costs were also collected, and predictions for radiotherapy usage in cervical cancer were calculated. The actual image-guided brachytherapy utilization (A-IGBTU) rate was calculated by dividing the IGBT fractions by the total brachytherapy fractions and multiplying the result by 100. The Radiotherapy Resources and Cost Calculator (RRCC; version 21.0) was used to assess shortages, while the economic model was based on clinical outcomes and toxicity models. Results Our survey revealed that 18,024 new patients were treated with radiotherapy, including 2,950 patients with gynecological cancers. Among these, cervical cancer accounted for 72% of the cases. The actual utilization rate of IGBT for cervical cancer was 33%. The RRCC (version 21.0) highlighted workforce shortages for radiation oncologists (ROs), medical physicists (MPs), and radiation technologists (RTTs) at 42, 63, and 61%, respectively. In the clinical outcome model, IGBT generated a total income of USD1,492,563. In the toxicity model, IGBT reduced the costs associated with treating grade-3 and grade-4 toxicities by at least 50%. Conclusion The actual utilization rate of IGBT for treating cervical cancer patients was 33%. The RRCC (version 21.0) highlighted workforce shortages across all roles. In our analysis, IGBT generated higher total income and significantly reduced the costs associated with treating severe toxicities.",

    "Abstract": "Some people living with HIV-1 (PLWH) experience insufficient increases in CD4 + T cell counts after antiretroviral therapy (ART), a clinical manifestation referred to as incomplete immune reconstitution (INR). INR significantly increases in the incidence of AIDS and non-AIDS events and profoundly affects the life expectancy and quality of life of PLWH. Recent studies have indicated that intestinal microecology plays a crucial role in immune reconstitution through multiple pathways. This review summarizes several mechanisms through which intestinal microecology contributes to impaired immune reconstitution in PLWH, including changes in microbiota composition, variations in intestinal metabolic products, and damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier. Additionally, intervention strategies such as fecal microbiota transplantation, probiotics, and traditional Chinese medicine are proposed. These innovative therapeutic approaches hold promise for overcoming the limitations of conventional treatments, providing clinicians with a scientific basis for personalized therapeutic strategies and researchers with theoretical guidance for exploring novel mechanisms and research methods. Ultimately, these efforts aim to improve the prognosis and quality of life for PLWH and reduce the global public health burden posed by HIV-1 infection.",

    "Abstract": "Objective The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between bilateral lower extremity explosive strength asymmetry and non-contact low back injuries in mine rescue workers, a specialized occupational group. Methods A single-leg countermovement jump (SLCMJ) test was performed on 101 rescue members who had participated in frontline rescue missions, using a force platform. The collected force platform data were used to calculate lower limb asymmetry. Injury incidence was measured by recording all non-contact low back injuries occurring during routine training or rescue operations over a 12-month follow-up period. Jump metrics (including eccentric peak force, vertical velocity at takeoff, peak takeoff acceleration, and takeoff peak force) associated with non-contact low back injuries were identified through Poisson regression analysis, and the optimal threshold for predicting injuries was determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Results Bilateral takeoff peak force asymmetry significantly increased the risk of non-contact low back injury. Each 1% increase in asymmetry raised the injury risk by 18.5% (RR = 1.185, 95% CI: 1.091–1.288, p &amp;lt; 0.001), equivalent to an absolute increase of 3.2% (RD = 0.032, 95% CI: 0.009–0.056). Using the optimal threshold of 7.05% for risk stratification, rescue workers in the high-risk group had a 3.6 times higher injury risk than the low-risk group (RR = 3.64, 95% CI: 1.353–9.832, p = 0.011), corresponding to an absolute risk difference of 24.1% (RD = 0.241, 95% CI: 0.073–0.409). Conclusion The interlimb asymmetry measured during the single-leg countermovement jump can be used to predict the risk of non-contact low back injuries in mine rescue workers over a 12-month follow-up period. Particular emphasis should be placed on the interlimb asymmetry of takeoff peak force.",

    "Abstract": "The environmental color, as a core visual environment element of living streets, has significant impacts on the users’ psychology and spatial perception. The seasonal variations in living streets’ environmental color are poorly understood, with existing literature mainly focusing on the warmer seasons. Meanwhile lacking natural experiences, outdoor activities and lights caused by cold climate, residents develop more urgent need to derive psychological support from their daily environment. This study firstly quantified eight streetscape color metrics using the K-means algorithm, then measured positive emotions by collecting human-factor signals and subjective evaluations. Subsequently, the mutual influences between the two were analyzed to address the effects of street interface color on positive emotions in winter. The results showed that: (1) Females exhibit significantly stronger positive emotional responses than males to winter street interface color; (2) Snow-free conditions generate markedly greater positive affect than snow-covered scenes; (3) The primary color saturation, primary color value, secondary color hue, secondary color value, and color harmony of winter street interface colors were significantly negatively correlated with positive emotions, while color complexity was significantly positively correlated positive emotions. These findings can provide urban planners and managers with theoretical basis and practical guidance for winter streetscape design, ultimately enhancing residents’ well-being and quality of life in winter.",

Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to maneb is associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). In vitro and in vivo experiments have further demonstrated that exposure to maneb induces neurotoxic effects in cells and animals, involving multiple injury pathways and molecular mechanisms, including reduced cell viability, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, synaptic dysfunction, and induction of apoptosis, ultimately leading to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Future research can focus on the systemic comprehensive toxicity and interaction mechanisms of maneb to promote its safe application in agricultural production.",

    "Abstract": "Background Accurate and interpretable influenza forecasting is critical for public health preparedness, yet many models struggle to capture multi-scale temporal dynamics and to provide reliable uncertainty estimates. These challenges are particularly pronounced in China, where influenza seasonality differs between northern temperate and southern subtropical regions. Methods We propose FaXNet, a frequency-adaptive, explainable, and uncertainty-aware deep learning framework that integrates data-driven spectral representation with interpretable component selection and probabilistic forecasting. We compiled weekly influenza positivity rates from the Chinese National Influenza Center and aligned them with ERA5-Land meteorological variables (temperature, dew point, and precipitation) for northern and southern China from 2011 to 2023. FaXNet was evaluated against representative statistical, machine learning, deep learning, and decomposition-based baselines for 1–4-week-ahead forecasting using standard accuracy and calibration metrics. Results FaXNet achieved consistently superior performance in both regions, with 1-week-ahead R 2 of 0.9319 (north) and 0.8665 (south), and 4-week-ahead R 2 of 0.4493 (north) and 0.4960 (south). The proposed method maintained a statistically significant performance advantage against all benchmarks across varying horizons, validating the effectiveness of frequency-adaptive modeling in mitigating error accumulation. Model explanations highlighted precipitation as the dominant meteorological driver in the north and temperature as the primary factor in the south. Conclusion FaXNet provides accurate, interpretable forecasts with calibrated prediction intervals across 1–4-week horizons, offering actionable lead time for region-specific risk assessment and resource planning. Performance may depend on surveillance data completeness and the limited set of exogenous covariates considered, motivating future extensions with additional drivers (e.g., mobility or vaccination) and broader external validation.",

However, existing clinical evidence is fragmented, especially regarding real-world case data. This study addresses the gap by systematically reviewing global case reports to analyze clinical features, diagnosis, and treatments, thereby offering more robust evidence for clinical practice. Methods Case reports of diseases caused by accidental mercury exposure, published from January 1950 to April 2025, were identified through a comprehensive search of three electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science. Following quality assessment using the Joanna Briggs Institute tool, data extraction was conducted on demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, diagnostic methods, exposure sources, treatment modalities, and patient outcomes to facilitate further analysis. Results This study analyzed 80 articles encompassing 126 cases of mercury poisoning, involving 61 males, 60 females, and 5 cases of unspecified sex. Patient ages ranged from 45-day-old neonates to 88-year-old adults. Clinical manifestations were diverse, primarily featuring systemic, respiratory, neurological, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Domestic/environmental exposure was the most common poisoning route (59.5%), followed by medical/iatrogenic exposure (16.7%) and occupational exposure (13.5%). Elemental and inorganic mercury were the predominant forms involved. Treatment primarily included chelation therapy, supportive care, and pharmacological interventions. Chelating agents were administered to 84.1% of patients, with DMSA, Dimercaprol (BAL), DMPS, and D-penicillamine being the most frequently used. Outcomes included complete recovery in 48.4% of cases, death in 13.5%, and long-term sequelae in some patients. Conclusion Mercury poisoning induces severe and multisystemic symptoms, notably neurological damage. Public awareness remains insufficient, and universally accepted diagnostic criteria are still lacking. This study highlights the urgent need to enhance public education, refine clinical guidance, and advance research toward standardized management protocols.

    "Abstract": "Background The scarcity of COVID-19 vaccines raised tough questions about who should get them first. While global guidelines stress fairness, they may overlook local realities and community voices. Without understanding these perspectives, efforts to ensure equity and build trust risk falling short. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the multifaceted perceptions, knowledge, and attitudes of community influencers in Uganda regarding COVID-19 vaccination. Methods This study adopted a mixed-methods cross-sectional descriptive design. The study participants were identified through community-based organizations (CBOs) to get a broad representation of the various community members and practical community entry points. Quantitative data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic content analysis with NVivo 12.0 software. Results A total of 100 Ugandan participants took part in the study, less than half of the participants 46.0% knew Uganda/MoH guidelines only. Forty two percent (42%) were neutral on vaccines curbing COVID-19 spread, with uniform effectiveness beliefs ( p &amp;gt; 0.05). Ninety percent (90%) supported guiding principles. Only few of the participants 31% agreed that they were very likely to contract COVID-19 after vaccination, 81% favored equal treatment but low trust in equity across classes or tribes. From the qualitative data, five themes which included, gender/power imbalances, economic divides, social norms, herbal alternatives, and tribalism. Global equity skepticism was high (57% no trust in LMIC/HIC quality parity); 86% endorsed national equity, but doubts persisted on at-risk prioritization and fair distribution. Conclusion While awareness of guidelines is relatively high, it is overshadowed by pervasive skepticism regarding vaccine efficacy, profound distrust in the fairness and integrity of distribution processes, and a feeling of exclusion from decision-making at global and national levels. Therefore, addressing these challenges requires a multi-pronged approach that goes beyond simply disseminating information about COVID-19 vaccination. With the strong support for ethical principles in COVID-19 vaccination, addressing equity gaps through culturally attuned strategies is essential for equitable distribution and sustained public trust in Uganda.",

    "Abstract": "Background To investigate the impact of social support factors on the acceptance of rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), and to provide evidence for developing personalized interventions to improve the rapid ART initiation rate. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among patients visiting Lanzhou Pulmonary Hospital between September 2024 and January 2025. Data were collected via questionnaires. Variable selection was performed using univariable logistic regression; those with a significance level of p &amp;lt; 0.05 were included in a multivariable logistic regression model. Group differences in rapid initiation rates were assessed using the chi-square test. Results Among the 530 participants (506 males, 481 Han ethnicity), the highest proportion was in the 31 to &amp;lt;46 age group. Univariable analysis showed that age, education, cross-regional treatment, marital status, monthly income, disclosure to spouses/family, and having infected peers were associated with rapid ART initiation. The multivariable model identified that younger age groups (15- &amp;lt; 31 and 31- &amp;lt; 46), cross-district treatment within the city, monthly income ≥5,000 CNY, disclosure to spouses/family, and having infected peers were facilitators, while being unmarried was a barrier. Rapid initiation rates differed significantly based on spouses’/family members’ attitudes post-disclosure ( χ 2 = 4.281, p = 0.039) and provision of support ( χ 2 = 4.281, p = 0.039), but not on peer support provision ( p = 0.058). Among the support provided by spouses/family members, psychological support was the most common and was associated with the highest rapid ART initiation rate. The proportions of financial support and material support were similar, and their corresponding rapid initiation rates were also comparable. PLWHA who received no support had the lowest rapid initiation rate, which was significantly lower than rates observed with any form of support. Similar results were observed in the subgroup with infected peers: psychological support had the highest proportion and the greatest rapid ART initiation rate, while the absence of peer support was associated with the lowest proportion and the smallest rapid initiation rate. Conclusion Integrating social factors into rapid ART initiation interventions, through a support network connecting families, peers, and healthcare institutions, can enhance treatment willingness and timeliness, ultimately improving outcomes for PLWHA.",

    "Abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a persistent global health challenge that is associated with morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. In most outpatient (OP) settings, such as emergency rooms, primary and specialty care clinics, and dental clinics, antibiotics are often inaccurately prescribed due to patient expectations, empirical decision-making, and limited access to diagnostic data. Despite existing national frameworks, surveillance systems, and stewardship initiatives, resistance among key pathogens in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a part of the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR), is increasing. Many OP settings are underdeveloped, as most efforts focus on hospital inpatients, leading to inappropriate antibiotic use, the promotion of resistant pathogens, and an increased risk of community-acquired infections. Intensifying antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) practices in OP settings brings an opportunity to enhance patient care, limit unnecessary prescriptions, prevent adverse reactions, and reduce healthcare costs. This perspective provides insights into regional AMR trends in the EMR, reviews existing governance, regulatory frameworks, and surveillance systems of the UAE, and identifies gaps with OP stewardship practices in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. It recommends a multi-level framework to support optimisation of OP antibiotic use, guided by regional trends, current practice, and lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic. By adopting this framework, current stewardship efforts can be strengthened, responsible antibiotic use promoted, and surveillance improved, progressing towards a coordinated, multi-sector strategy to preserve antimicrobial efficacy and sustain long-term progress against resistance.",

    "Abstract": "Rationale and objectives To evaluate if higher contrast medium injection pressure can improve image quality of digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in liver-directed interventions. Materials and methods Prospective single-center study including twelve patients with hepatocellular carcinoma ( n = 11) or liver metastases ( n = 1) undergoing intra-arterial therapies to systematically compare DSA image quality (primary endpoint) and radiation exposure (secondary endpoint) using two microcatheters with maximum application pressures 750 (“C750”) and 1,200 PSI (“C1200”). Patients underwent two DSAs with both microcatheters placed in the common hepatic artery. Application pressure, contrast medium flow, volume, and dose area product were recorded. Image quality was evaluated using a customized questionnaire and quantified by calculating signal- and contrast-to-noise-ratios, and vessel-to-liver signal intensity ratio. Results were compared by paired t -test and Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. Results Image quality using C1200 (achieved 917 ± 94 PSI) was rated more favorably than C750 (731 ± 45 PSI). C1200 reached higher scores of artery visualization in 72% cases, and significantly outperformed C750 regarding tumor blush in 100% ( p &amp;lt; 0.001). Contrast-to-noise-ratio were significantly higher in C1200 ( p &amp;lt; 0.001) and vessel-to-liver intensity ratios were significantly lower ( p = 0.001), both reflecting improved visualization and delineation of liver vessels. Signal-to-noise ratio did not differ significantly. Mean dose area product was comparable (C1200; 371.9 vs. 374.8 μGym 2 ). Conclusion The results suggest benefits of standardized CM injections for DSA using higher application pressure to enhance image contrast and tumor demarcation during IAT.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Regular cannabis use is associated with attenuated neural reward signaling, primarily measured through monetary or drug-cue tasks. Yet, minimal research has studied functional positive face processing in inhibitory control contexts, particularly amongst cannabis-using adolescent and young adults. The present study seeks to investigate functional response differences in whole-brain and ventral striatal activation, and ventral striatal functional context-dependent connectivity during positive (i.e., happy) face conditions during an emotional Go/No-go task in abstinent regular cannabis-using adolescent and young adults compared to controls. Methods Participants (age 16-26; cannabis-using=35; control=33) underwent at least two-weeks of monitored abstinence before completing an emotional Go/No-go fMRI task. Whole-brain analyses examined blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) differences for positive (minus neutral) face conditions between groups. Bilateral ventral striatal activity was investigated in region-of-interest and task-dependent functional connectivity analysis. Results Cannabis-using participants displayed increased left middle cingulum and decreased left supplemental motor area BOLD response during positive Go conditions. Decreased BOLD response was seen in left superior frontal region during positive No-go for cannabis-using participants. Ventral striatum activity was increased during Go and decreased during No-go conditions for cannabis-using group, with null connectivity findings. Discussion Clusters of aberrant functional response within cannabis-using adolescents and young adults aligns with previous, but sparse, literature on positive face engagement and inhibition. Here, we demonstrate variable ventral striatum activity consistent with reward-eliciting BOLD investigations—representing importance of reward-related affective investigations—yet no connectivity differences in this sample. These findings may represent a risk for or consequence of cannabis use, as differences are still notable after two-weeks of abstinence.",

    "Abstract": "Background Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) is a cofactor for NAD + -dependent enzymes that regulate DNA repair, cellular metabolism, and immune function. Supplementation with NAD + and its precursors is commonly used to prevent age-related disease and extend healthspan. Commercial clinical and wellness settings increasingly provide intravenous (IV) NAD + and nicotinamide riboside (NR) despite limited evaluation of safety and effectiveness. These considerations are important, as NAD + and its precursors differ in reported side effects, cellular uptake, and metabolism. This study sought to compare commercially administered NAD + IV and NR IV in humans by evaluating infusion time, tolerability, safety markers, and metabolic outcomes. Methods A retrospective review of electronic medical records was conducted in clients from a commercial setting. Participants received four consecutive days of 500 mg NAD + IV or NR IV, with 30 days follow-up. Primary outcomes included reported symptoms, total infusion time, blood pressure, resting heart rate, and biomarker assessments (ALT, AST, hsCRP, BUN/creatinine, and TSH). Exploratory analyses included metabolic biomarkers (HbA1c, fasting glucose, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides). Results Tolerability differed between groups. Participants that received NAD + IV reported moderate to severe gastrointestinal symptoms, increased heart rate, and chest pressure during infusions. Participants receiving NR IV experienced minor tongue, jaw, and arm tingling and mild cramping during infusion. All symptoms resolved upon infusion completion. Moderate to severe symptoms with NAD + IV resulted in longer infusion times compared to NR IV, averaging 97 min versus 37 min, respectively. No significant changes were observed in ALT, AST, hsCRP, BUN/creatinine, or TSH. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) decreased significantly in the NAD + IV group only, with values remaining within normal reference ranges. The NR IV group demonstrated a significant reduction in HbA1c, whereas the NAD + IV group showed a significant reduction in HDL-C. Neither group exhibited changes in fasting glucose or LDL-C over the 30-day period. Conclusion This study directly compared commercially administered NAD + IV and NR IV, providing preliminary real-world evidence of infusion tolerability and short-term safety. Exploratory metabolic outcomes were variable and warrant further investigation. Additional studies are needed to evaluate dosage and effectiveness beyond 30 days.",

    "Abstract": "Naïve CD8 + T cells are key players of adaptive immunity, but their heterogeneity and age-related changes are not fully understood. This study aimed to compare naïve CD8 + T cell subsets defined by different combinations of markers, namely, N CCR7 (CD45RA + CCR7 + ), N CD28 (CD45RA + CD28 + ), N CD27 (CD45RA + CD27 + ), and phenotypically most “true-naïve”-like, N TN (CD45RA + CCR7 + CD28 + CD27 + CD57 − ). Peripheral blood was harvested from donors of various ages and the phenotype of the four subsets of naïve CD8 + T cells was analyzed. N CD27 and N TN cells showed similar phenotypes with low expression of differentiation markers, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and effector molecules. Furthermore, they exhibited optimal mitochondrial fitness, low senescence markers, reduced apoptosis, and high proliferation potential. Hierarchical clustering identified cluster one including N CD27 and N TN , with lower expression of differentiation markers and pro-inflammatory molecules, and cluster 2, including N CCR7 and N CD28 cells, in which these parameters were more expressed. Age-related changes were observed in all subsets, although they were less pronounced for the N CD27 and N TN subsets. Taken together, this study demonstrates significant heterogeneity among naïve CD8 + T cell subsets, with N TN cells representing the most bona fide naïve phenotype and N CD27 showing a partially similar phenotype. These findings significantly enhance our understanding of naïve CD8 + T cell biology and function.",

    "Abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection can be performed through both deep retinal representations and vascular biomarkers. This proposed work suggests a multimodal framework that combines deep features with vascular descriptors in transformer fusion architecture. Fundus images are preprocessed using CLAHE, Canny edge detection, Top-hat transformation, and U-Net vessel segmentation. Then, the images are passed through a convolutional block attention module (CBAM)-fused enhanced MobileNetV3 backbone for deep spatial feature extraction. In parallel, the segmented vasculature is skeletonized to create a vascular graph, and the descriptors are computed using fractal dimension analysis (FDA), artery-to-vein ratio (AVR), and gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture. A graph neural network (GNN) then generates a global topology-aware embedding using all that information. The different modalities are integrated using a transformer-based cross-modal fusion, where the feature vectors from MobileNet and GNN-based vascular embeddings interact using multi-head cross-attention. The fused representation is then given to a Softmax classifier for DR prediction. The model demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional deep learning baselines, achieving an accuracy of 93.8%, a precision of 92.1%, a recall of 92.8%, and an AUC-ROC of 0.96 for the DR prediction in the Messidor-2 dataset. The proposed approach also achieves above 98% accuracy for Eyepacs and APTOS 2019 datasets for DR detection. The findings demonstrate that the proposed system provides a reliable framework compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Multi-agent/ensemble approaches can improve discrete-choice reasoning with large language models, but common orchestration methods are often non-deterministic, expensive, and difficult to reproduce. We propose ORCH, a deterministic multi-agent orchestrator that targets higher accuracy and better cost–performance via stable routing. Methods ORCH uses a pool of heterogeneous LLM agents and a deterministic routing mechanism based on exponential moving average (EMA) performance tracking. For each question, ORCH selects a small subset of agents, obtains candidate answers, and merges them through a controlled aggregation procedure. We evaluate ORCH on multiple discrete-choice benchmarks and compare against single-model baselines and non-routed ensemble strategies under consistent prompting and scoring. Results ORCH delivers consistent accuracy improvements over the best low-cost single model and provides additional gains over high-cost single-model baselines on several tasks, while reducing reliance on always-invoking expensive models. The deterministic routing and merge pipeline improves stability across runs. Discussion ORCH demonstrates that deterministic EMA-guided routing can offer a practical and reproducible orchestration strategy for discrete-choice reasoning. This framework can be extended to additional tasks, agent pools, and preference-aware routing policies in future work.",

Design RCT (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT06028334) with 1:1 randomization to 10 weeks of immediate treatment (IT) or waitlist (WL), with primary outcome measured at 10 weeks. A second randomization to 10 weeks of continued mHealth support vs. no treatment will allow for examination of effects of mHealth on maintenance of treatment gains. Participants 70 community-dwelling adults ≥6 months post msTBI; medically cleared and physically/ cognitively able to participate; physically inactive (≤23 weekly moderate/ vigorous activity units on Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire). Interventions 10-week GetUp&amp;amp;Go program: manualized, remotely delivered intervention with ingredients based on theoretical model of behavior change, in which participants set individual goals and programs for increasing PA; mHealth support via chatbot that delivers personalized messages, reminders, and reinforcement to participant phone. Main outcome measures Primary outcome is activity count measured by accelerometer worn on wrist for 7 days at all assessment intervals. Secondary outcomes include emotional function, fatigue, sleep, pain, health-related quality of life. Discussion While conclusions await the results of the trial, we consider PA enhancement to be a valuable and under-studied direction for treatment of msTBI. The advantages of the described treatment include strong theoretical and empirical basis for the treatment protocol, which has been designed to help to circumvent difficulties with initiation, persistence, and memory that interfere with the ability to develop healthful habits and routines following msTBI.",

Interventions included resistance and aerobic exercise, sensorimotor training, electrotherapy, and multimodal rehabilitation programs. Most studies reported significant reductions in pain intensity, improvements in functional capacity and quality of life, and no serious adverse effects. The methodological quality of the included trials was moderate to high. Conclusions Physiotherapy interventions, particularly structured exercise and electrotherapy, appear to be effective and safe adjuvant strategies that may contribute to improvements in pain-related and functional outcomes in people with cancer. The available evidence predominantly addresses neuropathic pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. Nevertheless, heterogeneity among protocols and small sample sizes limit the strength of conclusions, underscoring the need for additional high-quality randomized controlled trials.

    "Abstract": "Background Patient safety culture (PSC) is a critical component of healthcare quality, particularly in psychiatric settings where unique risks exist. In China, research on PSC within mental health institutions remains underdeveloped, and the factors influencing it are poorly understood. Methods This cross-sectional study utilized the Chinese version of the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPSC) to assess PSC among 2,524 mental health nurses from multiple Level-2 and Level-3 psychiatric hospitals in China (2021–2023). We specifically examined the impact of hospital level on PSC perceptions. Multivariate regression models were employed to identify predictors of PSC composites. Results The overall positive response rate (PPR) across the 12 PSC dimensions was 62.4%, indicating a moderate culture. Strengths were “Teamwork Within Units” (PPR = 83.3%) and “Organizational Learning” (PPR = 82.8%), while critical areas for improvement were “Nonpunitive Response to Error” (PPR = 46.6%) and “Staffing” (PPR = 43.3%). Regression analyses revealed that hospital level was a significant predictor of PSC outcomes, alongside years of experience and daily overtime hours ( P &amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions This pioneering national study reveals that the PSC landscape in Chinese psychiatric hospitals is characterized by specific strengths but also critical weaknesses, significantly influenced by hospital level. The findings compel a move away from one-size-fits-all approaches. We recommend stratified interventions: foundational support for Level-2 hospitals and advanced quality initiatives for Level-3 hospitals, with universal prioritization of addressing staffing shortages and fostering a nonpunitive “Just Culture”.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives This study aimed to investigate three-dimensional changes in incisive canal (IC) morphology, root–canal proximity, and root resorption following maxillary incisor (U1) retraction with clear aligners, comparing extraction and non-extraction treatment protocols. Materials and methods A total of 100 patients (200 U1) treated with clear aligners were retrospectively analyzed using CBCT before and after treatment. The extraction group included 40 patients and the non-extraction group 60. Linear measurements of IC width, root–canal distance, cortical bone width (CBW), IC height, and root length/width were obtained at three levels above the labial cementoenamel junction (H1–H3: 2, 4, and 6 mm). Volumetric and surface area analyses of the IC and U1 were performed to evaluate morphological and structural remodeling. Group differences and predictive factors for root resorption and canal contact/invasion were assessed statistically. Results Extraction-based retraction produced significantly greater reductions in canal width, CBW, and root–canal distance, with increased apical root resorption, most notably in patients who underwent substantial anterior retraction (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). The mean decreases in root–canal distance were 1.08 ± 0.92 mm, 1.10 ± 0.91 mm, and 1.02 ± 0.99 mm at H1, H2, and H3, respectively, in extraction cases, vs. 0.40 ± 0.58 mm, 0.47 ± 0.78 mm, and 0.30 ± 0.98 mm in non-extraction cases. Apical root resorption averaged 0.91 ± 0.80 mm in the extraction group and 0.32 ± 0.56 mm in the non-extraction group ( P &amp;lt; 0.05), correlating with closer root–canal proximity. Volumetric and surface area analyses revealed greater reductions in IC and U1 dimensions in extraction cases, indicating intensified bone remodeling. Treatment duration, incisor movement, IC height, and root–canal distance were significant predictors of canal contact, while root resorption correlated positively with treatment duration, incisor movement, and root length. Conclusion Extraction-based aligner retraction elicits greater osseous remodeling around the incisive canal and increased root resorption, particularly in cases requiring substantial anterior retraction, reflecting a coupled bone–tooth adaptive response to orthodontic loading. These findings highlight the dynamic nature of craniofacial bone physiology and emphasize the need for biologically guided treatment planning to minimize tissue stress and iatrogenic effects.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction The menstrual cup is worn intravaginally, holding blood up to 12 h before emptying and reinserting. It offers protection from sexually transmitted infections and bacterial vaginosis, whilst preserving a Lactobacillus crispatus –dominant vaginal microbiome. The menstrual disc, a type of menstrual cup, is positioned near the cervix and can remain in place during sex, enabling female sex workers (FSWs) to avoid unsafe practices to conceal menstruation during work. In this study, we aim to examine the perceptions and experiences of a convenience sample of FSWs 6 months after they received a menstrual disc, along with client views. Methods In a qualitative design, our Kenyan study recruited 38 FSWs in 4 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 86 clients in 9 FGDs. Using a semi-structured guide, a Kenyan moderator and note-taker facilitated audio-recorded discussions. Following translation and transcription, the discussions were analysed using deductive thematic analysis. Results Six themes emerged: Anticipation and reaction to seeing the menstrual cup, Apprehension and determination to use, Benefits, Challenges, Secrecy, and Use during sex. Some FSWs were able to insert the cup on initial attempt, typically others encountered discomfort, pain, or misalignment during insertion or difficulty in removing. By the end of the third month, the majority were using the cup without experiencing any leakage, pain, or concerns. Benefits noted included ease, convenience, reduced leakage, and comfort. Financial advantage over pads and ability to work regularly were also noted. Nearly all FSWs used the cup during sex, despite prior anxiety that a client would detect it and react negatively. In three instances, the FSWs reported that a client “may” have felt the disc, whilst noting just two clients “may” have felt something. None reacted badly. In summing up their experience, the FSWs spoke very positively about the disc, with the intention to keep wearing it in the future. Many clients were supportive of the disc but did not want to know whether an FSW was wearing it. Conclusions The FSWs quickly adapted to using the disc, finding it a comfortable, reliable menstrual product with financial advantages. With clients remaining mostly unaware of its use, the FSWs enthusiastically embraced the disc with the intention to keep using it. These positive outcomes have implications for future scale-up and roll-out to other vulnerable female populations.",

Aim This study seeks to investigate the impact of the Kegel exercise on maternal postpartum pain, pelvic floor dysfunction, and sexual function among women in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the National Guard Hospital, King Abdul-Aziz Medical City, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Methods a quasi-experimental design with six weeks apart pre- and post-tests was used, having 31 participants per group recruited with a convenience sample method. An interviewer-administered questionnaire containing a 20-item Pelvic Floor Disability Index (PFDI-20), a 19-item Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), and the Visual Analog Scale with the Faces Pain Rating Scale was used to measure pelvic floor dysfunction, sexual function, and postpartum pain, respectively. These tools were valid and reliable. Results Results revealed a significant increase in the Female Sexual Function Index in the experimental group after the intervention and a substantial decrease in the Visual Analog Scale with the Face Pain Rating Scale in both groups after the intervention. There were no statistically significant differences between the experimental and control groups in the total score of pelvic floor dysfunction. However, the Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory subscale showed a substantial increase in the control group post-test. In conclusion, the current study has shown that Kegel exercises can increase sexual drive and reduce pain in women with postpartum complications.",

    "Abstract": "Neogloboquadrina pachyderma is the dominant planktonic foraminiferal species in polar oceans and a major contributor to biogenic carbonate production in the Southern Ocean. Its calcite test serves as a key geochemical archive for reconstructing past ocean conditions through stable isotope and trace element proxies. As polar marine ecosystems undergo rapid environmental change, understanding the ecological associations and trophic dependencies of N. pachyderma within surrounding pelagic communities is increasingly important, particularly in extreme Antarctic environments. Here, we present the first molecular characterization of pelagic eukaryotic assemblages associated with individual N. pachyderma (genetic Type IV) specimens collected from Prydz Bay, East Antarctica, using a single-cell 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding approach. High-throughput sequencing revealed that the N. pachyderma eukaryome was dominated by dinoflagellates (Dinophyceae), diatoms (Bacillariophyceae), radiolarians, Syndiniales, and metazoans. In contrast, ambient seawater communities were enriched in cercozoans, followed by dinoflagellates, radiolarians, and ciliates. The distinct composition of eukaryotic assemblages associated with N. pachyderma relative to the surrounding seawater suggests selective incorporation of a subset of the local pelagic eukaryotic pool, potentially reflecting trophic interactions or transient associations with aggregate-associated prey. These results provide preliminary molecular insights into the trophic linkages or pelagic eukaryotic associations of Antarctic N. pachyderma Type IV, in Prydz Bay, East Antarctica, and establish an important baseline for future investigations. Our findings highlight the role of pelagic eukaryotes in shaping foraminiferal microbial interactions and underscore the relevance of such associations for interpreting palaeoceanographic proxies in a rapidly changing Southern Ocean.",

    "Abstract": "The use of high-resolution data in aquatic applications increased significantly in the last decade with the launch of decametre-scale optical sensors. More recently, commercial very-high resolution (VHR) sensors, offering finer spatial and temporal resolutions, have shown the potential of complementing data from high-resolution missions. Planet SuperDove (SD), with a band-setting similar to the Copernicus Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (S2-MSI), a 3-m spatial resolution and quasi-daily revisiting time, show the potential for widening water monitoring applications to smaller water basins, and finer-scale phenomena. However, the uncertainties in SD products need to be quantified, to assess their fitness-for-purpose for these applications. This work aims to provide uncertainty estimates for SD-derived aquatic remote sensing reflectance (R RS ) in different water types, benefitting from the radiometric measurements of the AERONET-OC network. R RS was derived from both Surface Reflectance (SR) products, distributed by Planet, or from data processed with ACOLITE. The comparability between SD and S2-MSI products was also assessed comparing R RS and Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R RC ) from S2-MSI and SD. The results indicate generally low performance across all bands for both SD R RS products, except in the most turbid waters, and highlight the lack of a publicly available robust atmospheric correction processor for SD data for most optical water types. The comparison to S2-MSI shows promising results only when comparing R RC values, but differences still suggest issues associated with calibration and radiometry of the SD sensors. The results also highlight the need for a harmonization strategy to ensure consistent integration of these datasets within multi-source monitoring systems.",

    "Abstract": "Heart rate is one of the most vital physiological parameters and is clinically widely used to assess human health status. In recent years, wearable devices based on photoplethysmography (PPG) have been extensively applied in real-time monitoring. However, PPG signals are susceptible to interference from various types of noise during acquisition, particularly motion artifacts (MA), which pose a significant challenge to the accurate extraction of physiological parameters. This study focuses on heart rate extraction from dynamic PPG signals and explores denoising methods combining traditional signal processing and machine learning techniques. The main research contents of this paper are as follows: further improvements are made on the basis of existing algorithms by integrating support vector machines (SVM). A more comprehensive signal quality assessment is performed via SVM, which incorporates the time-domain and frequency?domain statistical characteristics of both PPG signals and triaxial acceleration (ACC) signals. In addition, the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is integrated to capture time-varying characteristics, thereby mitigating the impact of local signal quality degradation on the analysis of full-window signals. For spectral peak tracking, a Gaussian window is adopted to optimize the spectral search range and a comprehensive analysis is conducted by fusing spectral amplitude information with historical heart rate data. Experimental results demonstrate that the heart rate error of the test set is 1.71 beats per minute (BPM).",

    "Abstract": "Soil acidity remains a critical constraint to global agricultural productivity. Liming is a well-established management practice to ameliorate acid soils, yet the agronomic effectiveness of diverse lime materials under varying pedoclimatic conditions requires systematic evaluation. Using the response ratios from the meta-analysis approach, the study synthesizes peer-reviewed studies (2000–2023) to quantify the effects of lime material type on soil physicochemical properties, crop yield, soil pH dynamics, and nutrient availability across various climatic conditions and agronomic management practices. The systematic literature search identified 40 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed an overall positive effect size of 17.54% on soil pH, reflecting the positive influence of different lime materials applied in various soil types and management systems in remediating soil acidity. Dominant liming materials, including dolomitic lime and calcium carbonate, had positive effects of 14.12% and 15.19%, respectively. Soil available phosphorus varied widely from -17.59% to 20.9%, indicating heterogeneity of materials in acidic soil remediation. Lime materials such as Calmasil, CaCO 3 , burnt dolomitic, dregs, ash, and dolomitic lime negatively impacted H+Al levels, with mean effects of -52.35%, -59.32%, -39.32%, -26.58%, -18.07%, and -14.3%, respectively. The agronomic value of lime is context-dependent, with significant influence of lime type, soil type, tillage system, crop system, and placement method across different crops. Soil conditions, including initial soil pH, exchangeable aluminum, acidity, exchangeable bases, and base saturation, were critical in determining the impact on soil properties and crop yields under field conditions. This analysis provides evidence-based guidelines for lime material selection strategies tailored to its quality and agronomic management practices for sustainable crop productivity.",

    "Abstract": "There is limited information on the agronomic performance of fertiliser products from dehydration of mixtures of urine and solid waste materials under field conditions. This study investigated the effects of products derived from dehydration (glasshouse) of pine bark (PB), biochar, and ash mixed with artificial human urine as sources of nitrogen (N) for spinach ( Spinacia oleracea) in field conditions. A field trial was conducted at the Ukulinga Research Farm to evaluate the effect of these pine bark urine-based products on spinach growth over two seasons. The products were applied at the recommended N rate for spinach in the first season. The pine bark feedstock, biochar, and ash that were not pretreated with urine were included as reference materials, whereas plots without N and with urea were included as negative and positive controls, respectively. In the second season, the same plots were used without any additional treatment to assess residual effects. In each season, the field trial lasted for approximately 3 months, from 04/06/2024–04/09/2024 and 12/09/2024–04/12/2024. Spinach dry matter yield, nutrient uptake, and tissue micronutrients were determined, together with soil pH, extractable phosphorus (P), and mineral N. The urine-based products improved dry matter yield and N uptake of spinach as compared with the negative control. However, high sodium (Na) concentrations were detected in plant tissues (first season). Residual applications led to an increase in dry matter yield of biochar-U (238 g plot −1 ) compared with the positive control (155.7 g plot −1 ). Residual application of urine-based fertilisers reduced the risk of sodium accumulation, as the initial crop absorbed most of the sodium. These findings suggest that urine-based (biochar-U) fertilisers are a viable and sustainable alternative to mineral N fertilisers. This supports the philosophy of circular economy through resource efficiency, as promising option for smallholder farmers, although Na concentrations need to be monitored.",

    "Abstract": "Background Evidence on empowering motivational climates in Chinese university physical education is limited, particularly regarding how students cluster into distinct perception patterns and how such heterogeneity can be converted into profile-specific teaching actions that support competence and self-regulation. This study identified latent profiles of university students’ physical education perceptions and derived actionable implications aligned with empowering climates. Methods In a mixed-methods study, undergraduates from 10 universities in Shandong Province (China) completed a survey used to identify latent perception profiles across six learning-related dimensions and to test demographic predictors. Student and teacher interviews were thematically analyzed to interpret profile mechanisms and inform recommendations. Results Among 1,259 students, three clearly separated profiles emerged (entropy = 0.892). Females had higher odds of membership in lower-support profiles [largest OR = 1.732, 95% CI (1.199, 2.504)]. Second-year students were more likely than first years to belong to the moderate-to-higher profile relative to the low profile [OR = 1.483, 95% CI (1.071, 2.054)]. Interviews suggested that performance visibility and threat constrained engagement, whereas progress referenced assessment with explanatory feedback strengthened perceived competence and self-regulation, helping explain profile differences. Conclusion Findings position motivational climate as a key lever for improving Chinese university PE and provide a profile-informed implementation pathway. We recommend a classroom prescription combining tiered tasks, structured choice, and low-threat, progress-referenced formative assessment with explanatory feedback. Implementation should prioritize first-year classes and female students, consolidate through self-monitoring and peer assessment, and scale via structured autonomy and resource optimization.",

    "Abstract": "Background While atrial fibrillation (AF) and older age are established independent risk factors for greater ischemic stroke severity, their interactive effect remains poorly characterized. This study aimed to evaluate the interaction between age and AF status on stroke severity, as measured by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study using a prospectively collected institutional stroke registry comprising 5,044 patients with acute ischemic stroke from 2019–2023. The primary exposures were AF status and age, categorized as &amp;lt; 65 and ≥65 years, while stroke severity at admission measured by the NIHSS served as the outcome. NIHSS was modeled using a negative binomial distribution within PROC GLIMMIX with a logarithmic link function to account for overdispersion in the NIHSS scores. Model included age, AF, and their interaction term, along with relevant co-variates such as gender, race and premorbid mRS. Results AF was present in 17.3% of patients. Stroke severity was significantly greater in patients with AF across both age groups: IRR 1.88 (95% CI, 1.44–2.45; p &amp;lt; 0.0001) in patients &amp;lt; 65 years, and IRR 2.13 (95% CI, 1.89–2.39; p &amp;lt; 0.0001) in patients ≥65 years. The interaction between AF and age on stroke severity was not statistically significant ( p for interaction = 0.40). Conclusions AF is associated with greater stroke severity in both younger and older adults. There was no statistically significant interaction between age and AF status on NIHSS scores, indicating no evidence of effect modification by age within limits of our data. These findings underscore the need to consider stroke severity in risk stratification, especially in younger AF patients who often experience greater treatment burden.",

    "Abstract": "Food safety is crucial to both national development and public well-being. Amid the increasingly complex food safety landscape, regulating firms' production practices is essential for effectively addressing related risks. The relationship between firm size (FS) and food safety risks (FSRs) has garnered substantial academic attention, yet consensus remains elusive. This study advances the literature by analyzing 2021–2023 food safety supervision and sampling data from 30 provinces (including autonomous regions and municipalities) in China. It empirically examines the relationship between FS and FSRs from two dimensions: the probability of food safety risk occurrence (PFSRO) and the severity of food safety hazards (SFSHs). The results reveal a significant negative association between FS and the PFSRO, but no significant relationship between FS and the SFSHs. These findings are robust across multiple tests. Overall, the results suggest that while larger FS reduces the PFSRO, it does not lessen the severity of the outcomes when such risks occur. The findings provide important insights for optimizing consumer behavior and informing regulatory policy to better prevent and mitigate FSRs.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the efficient extraction of anthocyanin from mango peel wastes using ultrasound and microwave-assisted hydrophilic natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES). Among the various NADES combinations tested, choline chloride: lactic acid (1:2) exhibited the highest extraction yield. Process variables such as sonication duration (15–30 min), microwave intensity (30.11–60.22 W/g), and microwave duration (20–60 s) were optimized using the Box–Behnken experimental design. Under optimized conditions, the anthocyanin yield significantly increased to 44.77 mg/g dry weight for ChCl: lactic acid, compared to 4 ± 0.02 mg/g dry weight for acidified ethanol, demonstrating the synergistic effect of ultrasound and microwave-assisted NADES in enhancing extraction efficiency. Spectrophotometric and stability analyses confirmed the integrity and storage behavior of the extracted anthocyanin under different environmental conditions. Additionally, antioxidant activity (DPPH) and ferric reducing power of the ChCl: lactic acid extract were recorded as 39 ± 0.1 and 40 ± 0.82 μmol AAE/g dry weight, respectively, which were markedly higher than those obtained using the conventional method (17.11 ± 0.16 and 20.29 ± 0.87 μmol AAE/g dry weight). The total phenolic content was higher in ChCl: lactic acid (2.82 ± 0.72 mg GAE/g dry weight) than in acidified ethanol (1.21 ± 0.17 mg GAE/g dry weight). Color analysis also showed greater color intensity for ChCl: lactic acid (1.211 ± 0.23) compared to acidified ethanol (1.093 ± 0.10). The findings support the use of green solvents and non-conventional extraction techniques for the valorization of agro-industrial waste into valuable bioactive compounds.",

    "Abstract": "Background Sweet potato is a key food and nutrition security crop in Malawi and across sub-Saharan Africa, especially biofortified orange-fleshed varieties that address vitamin A deficiency. However, productivity and market performance remain low due to limited access to quality planting materials, weak postharvest systems, and fragmented value chain governance. Emerging digital innovations such as machine learning (ML), hyperspectral imaging (HSI), and remote sensing present new opportunities to improve productivity, efficiency, and inclusivity across the sweet potato value chain. Objective This systematic review synthesizes evidence on how data-driven and gender-responsive innovations can enhance productivity, equity, and sustainability within the sweet potato value chain in Malawi and comparable African contexts. Methods Peer-reviewed studies were systematically reviewed following PRISMA guidelines. Twenty-six articles published between 2015 and 2025 were selected from Google Scholar and ScienceDirect. Data extraction captured study characteristics, focus areas, and outcomes. Study quality and bias were assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. Results Of the reviewed studies, 27% focused on production, utilization, and governance, revealing gaps in coordination, policy alignment, and value addition. About 43% examined ML and HSI applications for yield prediction, quality grading, and spatial mapping, reporting 80–95% accuracy in predicting physical and nutritional attributes. Only 17% explicitly addressed gender and inclusion, showing persistent inequities in digital participation. A smaller subset (13%) proposed frameworks combining AI, participatory governance, and policy tools for inclusive food systems. Collectively, the evidence highlights rapid advancement in digital agriculture but limited integration with gender, governance, and capacity-building dimensions. Conclusion Data-driven tools hold transformative potential to enhance productivity, quality, and market systems in sweet potato value chains. To realize this potential, digital agriculture must be embedded in inclusive, gender-responsive, and context-specific frameworks that strengthen research–policy–practice linkages, data infrastructure, and institutional collaboration for resilient and equitable food systems.",

    "Abstract": "Agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa continue to face mounting pressures from food insecurity, climate variability, and the erosion of agro-biodiversity. In Benin, neglected and underutilized species (NUS)—including fonio, Bambara groundnut, sesame, and sweet potato—offer significant nutritional, cultural, and ecological benefits, yet they remain largely absent from national agricultural policy priorities. This study examines how actors in the Atacora region engage with this policy gap by analyzing the diversity of NUS cultivated, the institutional treatment of these species, and the ways producers and organizations perceive and adapt to weak policy support. Using an actor-oriented approach and a mixed-methods design, the research combines a review of major agricultural policy instruments with empirical data from 60 semi-structured interviews involving farmers, cooperatives, NGOs, development projects, research institutions, and public agencies. Results show that NUS are sustained primarily through grassroots and NGO-led initiatives, while state institutions contribute little beyond broad diversification rhetoric. Producers’ perceptions of agricultural policies are predominantly uninformed or negative, and organizational actors highlight significant gaps in institutional visibility, program design, and extension support. In response, actors mobilize a combination of endogenous strategies—such as seed exchange networks, collective labor, and local processing—and exogenous measures including training, equipment provision, and certification. The study demonstrates that NUS valorization in Benin emerges from hybrid governance arrangements shaped by policy neglect and strong local agency. It further shows the value of an actor-oriented lens for understanding how agricultural policies are interpreted and transformed within local food systems.",

    "Abstract": "Background Humeral surgical neck fractures (HSNF) are among the most common shoulder fractures, yet their treatment outcomes remain variable. Clinical observations suggest that combining traditional Mongolian alcohol-spraying bone-setting therapy with muscular origin-insertion point massage may accelerate fracture healing; however, the therapeutic efficacy and underlying mechanisms require further validation. Methods A total of patients with HSNF were randomly allocated into two groups. The control group received Mongolian alcohol-spraying bone-setting therapy, while the experimental group received the same treatment plus muscular origin-insertion point massage. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the Constant-Murley and Neer shoulder function scores at multiple time points. To explore potential mechanisms, serum levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and hemorheological parameters (erythrocyte aggregation index, plasma viscosity) were measured. Results From four weeks post-treatment onward, the experimental group exhibited significantly higher Constant-Murley and Neer scores compared with the control group ( p &amp;lt; 0.05). Biochemical analysis showed that serum sICAM-1 was significantly lower in the experimental group beginning at two weeks ( p = 0.02), whereas sVCAM-1 was reduced from four weeks ( p &amp;lt; 0.01). In contrast, PDGF ( p = 0.03) and IGF-1 ( p = 0.04) were significantly elevated from four weeks onward in the experimental group. Moreover, erythrocyte aggregation index ( p = 0.02) and plasma viscosity ( p = 0.04) were significantly lower in the experimental group from four weeks post-treatment. Conclusion The combination of muscular origin-insertion point massage with Mongolian alcohol-spraying bone-setting therapy yields favorable clinical outcomes, potentially by alleviating local inflammation and enhancing microcirculation, thereby promoting fracture healing. This integrative approach may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the management of HSNF.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Sacrocolpopexy with concomitant hysterectomy is a common procedure for the treatment of pelvic organ prolapse. However, occult endometrial pathologies, including malignancies, may be present in some patients, which should be considered when planning the management. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of occult endometrial pathologies, including malignancies, in patients undergoing sacrocolpopexy with concomitant supracervical hysterectomy, and to identify associated risk factors. Materials and methods This was a retrospective, single-center study including all patients who underwent sacrocolpopexy with supracervical hysterectomy between November 2010 and December 2023. A total of 226 procedures were analyzed. Results Among the 226 patients, 15 cases of occult endometrial pathology were identified, representing an incidence of 6.6%. These included 14 cases of endometrial hyperplasia with atypia (6.2%) and 1 case of endometrial carcinoma (0.4%). No oncological recurrence was observed after a mean follow-up period of 26 months. Conclusions The incidence of occult endometrial pathologies in this cohort was 6.6%. Particular attention should be given to postmenopausal patients and those with risk factors for endometrial malignancy. The use of a containment bag is recommended during specimen extraction to prevent the potential dissemination of occult malignancies. This study highlights the importance of avoiding unprotected morcellation of surgical specimens, particularly in high-risk populations.",

    "Abstract": "Background Laparoscopic operation holds multiple advantages as a minimal invasive method of surgical treatment. Vascular-related manipulations, including identification and dissection of vascular structures and control of bleeding, are highly experience-based and demand a tortuous learning curve. With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) in the entire diagnosis and treatment process of diseases, data-driven AI models have shown promising potentials in both education and real-time aiding in surgery. However, there is no dedicated dataset existing for developing vascular identification models in laparoscopic settings. Methods Videos from 23 laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy (LDP) and laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) performed at Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) between January 2021 and June 2022 were collected. Senior surgeons systematically reviewed surgical videos to visually identify critical venous vasculature, precisely annotating frame-accurate start and end timestamps on the video timeline. Frames were extracted from these video segments at a fixed temporal interval of one frame per second, then stored to compile the source image dataset. The contours of superior mesenteric vein (SMV), portal vein (PV), splenic vein (SV) were labelled and reviewed according to standard procedure. A High-Resolution Network (HRNet) was combined with a fully convolutional network (FCN) output head to construct a preliminary segmentation model for initial validation and comparison. Results A dataset comprises 19,003 annotated frames and is publicly available. The baseline model achieved a recall of 79.6%, precision of 95.8%, and Dice coefficient of 0.69 on the testing set. Conclusion This study constructed and released the first large-scale, expert-annotated dataset of key venous structures from pancreatic surgery (PS) videos and established benchmark performance for intraoperative vein segmentation using open-source models.

    "Abstract": "Background Hartmann reversal (HR) is associated with considerable morbidity, and early identification of patients at risk of complications is crucial. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-established inflammatory biomarker, but its dynamic changes (ΔCRP) as a predictor of surgical success in HR remain unclear. This study evaluates the role of ΔCRP between postoperative days 1 and 3 in predicting surgical outcomes. Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted on patients undergoing HR at a tertiary hospital between January 2023 and December 2024. Demographic, clinical, and surgical data were collected. ΔCRP was defined as the absolute difference between CRP levels on postoperative days 1 and 3. Surgical success was defined as the absence of major complications, no need for reoperation, and discharge within the expected recovery period. Statistical analyses included logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to determine the predictive value of ΔCRP. Results A total of 83 patients were included. ΔCRP was significantly higher in patients with complications (56 vs. 136 mg/L, p &amp;lt; 0.001). ROC analysis identified an optimal ΔCRP cutoff of 113.1 mg/L for predicting surgical success (AUC = 0.754). Logistic regression confirmed ΔCRP as an independent predictor of success (OR: 1.015, 95% CI: 1.010–1.020, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusions ΔCRP is a valuable predictor of surgical success in HR. Patients with persistently elevated CRP levels may benefit from closer monitoring and early interventions.

    "Abstract": "Introduction In this study, an integrated surveillance framework was employed to simultaneously quantify the population densities of key vectors and reservoir hosts and screen them for associated pathogens across Zhejiang Province, China. Methods The light trap method, larval pipette method, fly trap method, sticky trap method, trap-night method, tick-picking method, dragging method, visual inspection method, and chigger mite picking method were used for the ecological surveillance of mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches, rodents, ticks, bedbugs, and chigger mites. Rodent samples were screened for Dabie Bandavirus, Hantavirus, Leptospira interrogans , Rickettsia typhi , and Orientia tsutsugamushi . Mosquito samples were tested for dengue, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, Zika, and chikungunya viruses. The descriptive statistics were used for analysis. Results In 2024, the mosquito density in Zhejiang Province was 16.03 mosquitoes per trap-night, with Culex tritaeniorhynchus (59.05%) and Culex pipiens pallens (31.37%) being the dominant species. Livestock sheds harbored the greatest mosquito densities, averaging 81.07 mosquitoes per trap-night. The average BI was 12.97. The rodent density was 0.34 rodents per 100 trap-nights, and the dominant species was Rattus norvegicus. The fly density was 3.06 flies per trap, with Sarcophagidae species being dominant. The cockroach density was 0.44 cockroaches per trap, with Blattella germanica comprising 97.13% of the total catch. The tick densities were 0.51 ticks per animal and 0.35 ticks per flag per 100 m. No bedbugs were detected. The chigger mite infestation rate was 71.11%. Regarding rodent-borne pathogens, the positivity rates for Hantavirus, L. interrogans , and O. tsutsugamushi were 2.42, 10.46, and 0.16%, respectively. No Dabie Bandavirus or R. typhi were recorded. All 27,402 mosquitoes tested negative for the target pathogens.

    "Abstract": "Thermal stress limits sustainable pig production in tropical regions by impairing growth, feed efficiency, and welfare. This study evaluated dietary Cissus quadrangularis selenium nanoparticles (CQ-SeNPs) for supporting growth performance and antioxidant capacity in pigs under natural tropical conditions in Zambia. Thirty-three weaner pigs were randomly assigned to three diets: control (basal), inorganic selenium (Na₂SeO₃), or CQ-SeNPs, and monitored for 30 days under moderate ambient temperatures below heat stress thresholds (27–32 °C for lighter and 18–28 °C for heavier piglets). Growth performance, including body weight, average daily gain (ADG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR), was measured. CQ-SeNPs supplemented pigs showed numerically higher ADG (267 g/day) and lower FCR (1.98) compared with control (264 g/day, 1.99) and Na₂SeO₃ (253 g/day, 2.04), but differences were not statistically significant ( p &amp;gt; 0.05). Body weight trends were similar across treatments, indicating limited activation of stress-related physiological pathways under these conditions. These results indicate that CQ-SeNPs supplementation is safe and may support growth under oxidative or thermal challenge, though further studies under defined heat stress are needed to confirm efficacy. Overall, findings highlight the potential of phytogenic selenium nanoparticles in developing climate-adaptive feeding strategies for sustainable swine production in tropical regions.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores the emotional and psychological challenges inherent in veterinary practice, a profession situated at the intersection of empathy, ethics, and trauma. Despite its compassionate reputation, veterinary work frequently exposes practitioners to distressing experiences, including euthanasia, caregiver grief, and moral dilemmas, which can culminate in burnout and compassion fatigue. Drawing on a Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) perspective, this study explores veterinary professionals’ lived experiences and understands occupational distress as a systemic and relational experience rather than an individual shortcoming. By moving beyond individual-level burnout models, veterinary distress is reframed as an outcome of cumulative exposure to suffering, moral conflict, and emotionally charged caregiver interactions embedded within organizational contexts. Using a qualitative phenomenological design, semi-structured interviews were conducted with six veterinary professionals, with data collection concluding upon thematic sufficiency, identifying emotional stressors, coping mechanisms, and unmet psychoeducational needs. Findings reveal (1) persistent emotional exposure and moral conflict as key sources of stress, (2) limited institutional support and a prevailing culture of endurance, and (3) strong reliance on informal peer networks for emotional regulation. These findings underscore the need for trauma-informed education, structured debriefing, and peer support systems within veterinary institutions. For stakeholders, veterinary schools, professional associations, and clinics, adopting trauma-informed policies offers a practical route to mitigating compassion fatigue, enhancing psychological safety, and sustaining compassionate engagement in animal care.",

The model endogenously captures adjustments in production, prices, bilateral trade flows, and welfare, and we assess robustness using systematic sensitivity analysis. Results Small outbreak scenarios generate limited sectoral disruption and no substantial GDP effects, with U.S. welfare losses of $310–$563 million. Large outbreak scenarios reduce U.S. hog production by 7.34%–8.57% and pork production by 7.25%–10.8%, increase U.S. hog producer prices by 41.6%–41.8% and pork prices by 6.5%, and reduce U.S. GDP by 0.05%. Corresponding U.S. welfare losses rise to $10.9–$11.4 billion. Globally, large outbreaks increase world hog and pork prices by 3.67%–3.69% and 1.20%–1.22%, respectively, and drive trade diversion toward alternative exporters. Discussion The results indicate that the economic costs of ASF increase substantially with outbreak size and are shaped by the severity of trade restrictions. Investments that prevent escalation (early detection, rapid containment) and strategies that preserve market access (credible regionalization/zoning arrangements) can substantially reduce welfare losses and global market disruption.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Effects on production performance from dietary inclusion of green fodder Sorghum in lactating water buffalos were explored. Rising feed price volatility makes low-cost forage crops a strategic option to reduce dairy farming costs. The use of green fodder sorghum through the cut-and-carry system improves forage utilization, nutrient intake, and milk yield and composition. Methods A total of 40 buffaloes, homogeneous in terms of milk yield, parity and body condition score (BCS), were selected and assigned to two groups: control group (C) and treated group (S). Experimental diets were offered to cover requirements as a Total Mixed Ration (TMR) with the inclusion of green fodder Sorghum (treated group, at an amount of 14.7% of TMR) and without (control group). The trial was conducted from July to September 2024. Milk samples were collected and analysed for chemical composition somatic cell count and urea. In addition, feed and faecal samples were collected to determine chemical composition and digestibility. Results The inclusion of green fodder sorghum did not affect milk yield (C: 10.4 kg/head/d vs. S: 10.4 kg/head/d) or milk composition, with the exception of fat content, which was significantly higher in the treated group (C: 71.2 g/kg vs. S: 85.0 g/kg; p &amp;lt; 0.01). This increase was associated with improved digestibility of NDF and ADF of the experimental diet compared to the control diet ( p &amp;lt; 0.01). Discussion The economic assessment revealed that partially replacing corn silage and other dietary ingredients with green sorghum should reduce feeding costs by 0.27 EUR/head/day, making this strategy economically advantageous. Overall, the inclusion of green fodder sorghum proved beneficial in terms of cost efficiency and productive performance, aligning with the sustainability goals of the 2030 Agenda, particularly SDGs 12 and 13.",

    "Abstract": "Legged robots exhibit high mobility on uneven terrain but face challenges in stability, complex control systems, and energy efficiency. This study proposes a leg mechanism that significantly alters its stiffness by inducing jamming in a chainmail structure through only gravity-induced compression. To evaluate the fundamental characteristics of the proposed mechanism, experiments were conducted to identify the jamming point and to assess stiffness in the jammed state. The results confirmed that the force required to trigger jamming increases proportionally with the mass applied from above, which demonstrates properties similar to friction between solid materials. Furthermore, the stiffness in the jammed state is strongly correlated with the contact points within the structure. These results prove the effectiveness of the proposed passive leg mechanism for stiffness switching. In a case study assuming landing on uneven terrain, the mechanism could be fixed in any orientation based on the designed compressive force.",

    "Abstract": "The fungicide Imazalil (IMZ) is widely used to maintain the freshness of fruits and vegetables after harvest. Despite its widespread use, the neurotoxic effects of IMZ remain poorly studied. Thus, in this work, we aimed to investigate the effects of subacute IMZ exposure on memory and learning, as well as on cholinesterase (ChE) activity, in orally exposed rats. To do so, Wistar rats were exposed to doses corresponding to 1/8, 1/4, and 1/2 of the LD50 of IMZ. Each dose was divided into four equal parts and administered once daily for four consecutive days, while behavioral performance was assessed using the Barnes Maze. On day 5, we measured ChE activity in the hippocampus and serum. The enzymatic activity assays demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in both cholinesterase activities at 1/4 LD50 of IMZ. In addition, rats in the control group exhibited a typical learning curve in the Barnes maze, characterized by reduced latency and fewer attempts to locate the escape box from the first session (S1) to the final session (S4). The typical learning curve was prevented by a 1/4 LD50 treatment. Additionally, this dose prevented an increase in spatial navigation strategy use, observed in the control group (S1 vs. S4). To our knowledge, these results proved that IMZ inhibits in vivo the activity of both brain and serum ChEs, and exhibits evidence of learning and memory impairments, suggesting that IMZ has neurotoxic effects in rats, probably mediated by alterations in the cholinergic system.",

    "Abstract": "Weaning is a critical developmental stage in puppies often accompanied by gastrointestinal disturbances and empiric antibiotic use. This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of two canine milk-derived probiotic strains, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus CECT 30021 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum CECT 30022, in recently weaned Labrador Retriever puppies. Forty-nine healthy puppies were enrolled and allocated to receive a daily capsule containing either strain alone, a combination of both, or placebo for six weeks, followed by a six-week observation period. Probiotic supplementation was well tolerated, and clinical, hematological, and biochemical parameters remained within normal ranges. Compared with placebo, the probiotic-treated puppies experienced fewer gastrointestinal infections and required less antibiotic therapy. Supplementation helped maintain normal fecal consistency, prevented increases in fecal calprotectin and inflammatory cytokines, and produced significantly higher fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations. Systemically, probiotic intake was associated with lower serum cortisol, IL-8, TNF-α, and cholesterol, and stronger antibody responses to vaccination. Probiotic-supplemented puppies also showed faster weight gain during treatment, and this difference persisted after supplementation ended. Overall, these findings indicate that both strains, administered individually or in combination, safely support gastrointestinal, metabolic, endocrine, and immunological health in Labrador Retriever puppies during weaning and may help reduce the need for antibiotics.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigated the effects of dietary xylanase and protease supplementation, applied individually or in combination, on growth performance, intestinal characteristics, gut fermentation, meat quality, and skeletal traits in broiler chickens. A total of 540-day-old male broiler chicks were allocated to six experimental groups and fed a control corn-soybean meal-based diet or diets supplemented with xylanase, protease, or a xylanase–protease combination. Enzyme supplementation significantly improved body weight gain and feed efficiency, particularly between days 22 and 42, and reduced intestinal digesta viscosity. Improvements in gut morphology were reflected by increased villus height and villus-to-crypt ratios, accompanied by higher cecal total volatile fatty acid concentrations, increased Lactobacillus populations, and reduced coliform counts. In contrast, breast meat physicochemical composition and antioxidant status were not affected by dietary treatments. Skeletal development was positively influenced, with improvements observed in selected morphometric and structural bone traits. Overall, dietary xylanase and protease supplementation enhanced broiler performance and skeletal development primarily through improved digestive efficiency and favorable modulation of gut morphology, microbial ecology, and intestinal fermentation, without adverse effects on meat quality.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus, GAS) is the most common cause of bacterial pharyngitis and a major contributor to morbidity and mortality worldwide. There has been an increase in invasive GAS infections and related deaths in several European countries post-COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to assess parental knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding GAS pharyngotonsillitis, with a focus on antibiotic use and misuse. Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted on a convenience sample of parents of children admitted to the Pediatric Ward or visiting the Pediatric Emergency Department of the University General Hospital of Patras, Greece (September 2024–February 2025). For knowledge assessment, the questionnaire consisted of 10 True/False questions, based on which a total knowledge score was calculated. For attitude and practice assessment, the questionnaire consisted of 10 Likert scale questions. A Negative Practice Score was calculated as a sum of the answers in five practices with a negative perspective, with higher scores indicating worse practices and lower scores indicating better practices. Results: The study enrolled 378 parents, 79% of them were aware that not all children with a sore throat need antibiotics, and 61% believed asymptomatic children with a positive strep antigen test should receive antibiotics. Concerns about GAS transmissibility were high (76%), while attitudes about severity were mixed. A median GAS total knowledge score of 6 (IQR: 4–7) indicated moderate knowledge. Multivariable analysis revealed that male parents, non-immigrants, those previously hospitalized for GAS infection, and those informed by pediatricians or reliable websites had significantly higher knowledge scores. Regarding practices, most parents (72%) disagreed with requesting antibiotics from pediatricians, and 93.9% did not administer leftover antibiotics. Additionally, 58% expressed more concerns in recent years due to the increase in invasive infections. The median GAS Negative Practice Score was 10.5 (IQR: 7.0–13.0), indicating generally good practices, as lower scores correspond to fewer negative practices. Older parents and those with higher knowledge scores were also linked to fewer negative practices in multivariable analysis. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of targeted education on GAS pharyngotonsillitis and the need to focus on specific population groups to reduce antibiotic misuse.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Bovine mastitis (BM) remains an economically significant disease in the global dairy industry. Multidrug resistance (MDR) in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella grimontii has increased in recent years, representing an area of concern related to BM. Methods: Bovine mastitis 1-DH1 and 2-DH2 isolates (n = 2) were investigated. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the Neg-Urine-Combo98 panel. Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), virulence factor (VF) genes and plasmid replicons were identified by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Phylogenomic analyses were performed for a visual comparison of the genomes. Results: Phenotypically, isolates 1-DH1 and 2-DH2 were identified as K. pneumoniae-1DH1 and Klebsiella oxytoca, respectively; the latter was subsequently confirmed as K. grimontii-2DH2 by WGS. K. pneumoniae-1DH1 (20.0%, 5/25) exhibited phenotypic resistance to amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, ampicillin (AM), cefuroxime, colistin (Cl), and nitrofurantoin (Fd), whereas K. grimontii-2DH2 (8.0%, 2/25) was resistant to AM and nalidixic acid (NA). In total, 31 and 32 ARGs and 10 and 15 VF genes were identified in K. pneumoniae-1DH1 and K. grimontii-2DH2, respectively. Two plasmid replicons were detected in K. pneumoniae-1DH1 (one harboring the blaCTX-M ARG) compared to one in K. grimontii-2DH2 (encoding both the blaCTX-M ARG and the astA VF gene) isolates, respectively. Phylogenomic analysis showed that K. pneumoniae-1DH1 clustered most closely with human-derived K. pneumoniae isolates, whereas K. grimontii-2DH2 grouped with environmental K. grimontii isolates. Conclusions: Novel phenotypic resistance profiles were observed in the BM-associated K. pneumoniae-1DH1 (MDR, Cl and Fd) and K. grimontii-2DH2 (AM and NA) isolates. Notably, K. grimontii-2DH2 harbored a plasmid replicon carrying both the blaCTX-M ARG and the astA VF gene.",

    "Abstract": "(−)-Epicatechin (EC), taxifolin (Tax), and quercetin (Q) are flavonoids with different C-ring structures. We compared their physicochemical properties and biological activities. The comparison of their stability and redox properties was conducted at mildly acidic or neutral conditions mimicking the plant vacuole or gut, and their sympathetic hyperactivation ability was examined using catecholamine (CA) excretion and blood flow. At pH 5, flavonoids were stable, but at pH 7, their retention rates decreased in the order EC &gt; Q &gt; Tax. LC-MS analysis detected brown oxidized oligomers in EC, while Tax and Q primarily yielded degradation products. All flavonoids exhibited O2•− scavenging activity after incubation at pH 5. At pH 7 after 45-min, EC and Tax promoted O2•−, while Q only scavenged O2•− after 24-hr incubation, EC’s properties decreased but Tax’s properties enhanced. Computational chemistry analysis indicated EC has higher reactivity compared to Tax and Q. EC caused a significant increase in CA excretion and blood flow, which were not observed with Tax or Q or 24-h cultured EC. These results suggest that the C-ring structure of flavonoids plays a crucial role in their stability and redox properties. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species generated by flavonoids in the gut may exert beneficial effects through sympathetic activation.",

Among them, acoustic methods—ranging from passive acoustic emission monitoring to guided ultrasonic waves—have demonstrated exceptional potential for early detection, localization, and characterization of structural damage under harsh marine environments. This review provides a comprehensive and critical synthesis of the state-of-the-art in acoustic-based SHM applied to ships, submarines, offshore platforms, and floating renewable energy systems. Special emphasis is placed on the comparative performance of different acoustic techniques, their integration with numerical modeling and data-driven methods, and their suitability for real-world deployment considering hydrodynamic, operational, and environmental constraints. By bridging current achievements with future challenges, the paper highlights research gaps and outlines key directions to accelerate the transition of acoustic SHM technologies from laboratory studies to widespread industrial applications.

    "Abstract": "Background: The Allium cepa test is a widely used, cost-effective, and versatile model for assessing cytogenotoxicity. Cytotoxicity is determined through changes in root growth and the mitotic index, while genotoxicity is identified through chromosomal aberrations such as breaks, bridges, and micronuclei. Objective: To synthesize the methodological principles, applications, and interpretation of the assay’s endpoints, with emphasis on environmental monitoring, nanotoxicology, and the evaluation of emerging materials. Methods: An exploratory analytical approach was applied to identify and compare studies employing the Allium cepa assay across different contexts. The literature, selected from scientific databases, was organized to highlight methodological diversity and biomarker performance. Conclusions: Compared with other models, Allium cepa stands out for its simplicity, the availability of multiple cytogenotoxic markers, and its minimal ethical constraints, making it especially suitable for research in low-infrastructure settings. Future studies should work toward the international standardization of methodologies, the integration of this model with molecular and omics-based approaches, and its incorporation into predictive frameworks for environmental and human health risk assessment. In an increasingly complex toxicological landscape, Allium cepa emerges as a pivotal tool for enhancing toxicological surveillance and safeguarding biological systems.",

    "Abstract": "Cisplatin is an effective chemotherapeutic agent, yet its clinical utility is limited by dose-dependent nephrotoxicity. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) has cytoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties, but its therapeutic potential in cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) remains unclear. A murine cisplatin–AKI model was used to evaluate whether AAT (80 mg/kg) ameliorates renal injury. Renal function, oxidative stress, NADPH oxidase (NOX) isoforms, mitochondrial metabolism, inflammatory mediators, apoptosis, and fibrosis-related markers were assessed using biochemical, histological, immunohistochemical, and Western blot analyses. Cisplatin markedly impaired renal function and induced tubular injury; meanwhile, AAT significantly reversed these changes. Cisplatin also induced severe oxidative stress and disrupted the balance of NOX isoforms; AAT restored redox homeostasis. Cisplatin upregulated CPT1A/PDK4 and suppressed CPT2, UCP3, PGC1α, and DRP1, inducing maladaptive mitochondrial changes, indicating impaired β-oxidation and defective mitochondrial dynamics; AAT reversed these alterations, restoring normal mitochondrial metabolism. IL-1β, IL-6R, OPN, and F4/80 expression, recovery of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and MAPK activation were reduced, indicating decreased inflammation and apoptosis; profibrotic markers were also reduced. AAT confers multifaceted protection against cisplatin-induced AKI by restoring redox balance, mitochondrial homeostasis, and inflammatory and apoptotic signaling. These findings support AAT as a promising therapeutic agent for preventing cisplatin nephrotoxicity.",

    "Abstract": "Metabolic endotoxemia has been proposed as a possible mechanism to explain the strong link between inflammation, obesity, and obesity-associated disorders. Gut dysbiosis is a hallmark of obesity, and diet has been reported to regulate both inflammation and disease risk by affecting the composition of gut microbiota and gut barrier function. In the condition of microbial imbalance and impaired intestinal mucosa, bacterial endotoxins, specifically lipopolysaccharides, translocate from the gut into the bloodstream, where they can sustain a prolonged, sterile, low-grade inflammation, raising the risk of several non-communicable diseases. Increasing evidence indicates that the risk and incidence of obesity and several obesity-associated disorders are sex-specific, although the underlying mechanisms are only just emerging. Notably, most of the factors influencing metabolic endotoxemia exhibit sexual dimorphism. This review aims to summarize the human studies investigating the role of metabolic endotoxemia in obesity and associated diseases, with a focus on those highlighting sex differences. We also discuss the clinical relevance of circulating endotoxins in metabolic derangements and their potential role as sex-related and modifiable risk factors to consider in future prevention strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Post-grouting is an active reinforcement technique that can significantly enhance the bearing performance of bored piles. This study conducted field tests on three in situ test piles using tip grouting, side grouting, and combined tip-side grouting. Based on the analysis of static load test data, the improvement effects of different grouting methods on the vertical bearing behavior of the piles were quantified. In situ tests were then performed to elucidate the reinforcement mechanisms of various post-grouting techniques on the pile foundations. Based on the validated finite element model, the study explored the influence of key grouting parameters on the bearing performance of grouted piles. Analysis of the test data shows that all grouting methods improved the vertical bearing capacity of bored piles. The positive effect of tip grouting was more pronounced than that of side grouting. Furthermore, in the clay layer of the soft soil region, side grouting primarily manifested as splitting grouting, while tip grouting formed a hardened grout bulb at the pile tip through cementation and solidification, thereby significantly enhancing the mobilization of the pile tip bearing capacity. Finite element model analysis shows that, in terms of enhancing the bearing capacity of the pile, expanding the grout diffusion range is more effective than increasing the grout material strength.",

    "Abstract": "Huizhou covered bridges represent a unique and irreplaceable component of China′s architectural heritage, yet they are increasingly threatened by flash floods. In the Huizhou region, complex mountainous terrain, concentrated intense rainfall, and structural aging jointly exacerbate flood damage risks. Existing flood risk assessment approaches often prioritize external hydrodynamic hazards or assume linear additive effects, overlooking the complex interactions among inherent structural and physical attributes. To address this limitation, this study integrates Random Forest (RF) and fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to develop a flood risk assessment framework capable of capturing both nonlinear relationships and configurational (asymmetric) causal mechanisms. Based on field investigations of 89 covered bridges and 116 documented damage cases from 2020 to 2024, the RF model identifies six key risk factors (ACC = 0.79, AUC = 0.87), several of which exhibit pronounced nonlinear and threshold effects. Building on these results, fsQCA further reveals eight equivalent configurational pathways leading to covered bridge damage (solution coverage = 0.66, solution consistency = 0.94), highlighting multiple causal combinations rather than a single dominant driver. The results demonstrate that the disaster resilience of covered bridges emerges from interactions among structural characteristics, management conditions, and spatial scale attributes, rather than from any individual factor alone. Accordingly, this study advocates a shift in protection strategies from conventional “one-size-fits-all” structural reinforcement toward risk-pattern-oriented, precision-based non-structural interventions. By combining predictive modeling with configurational causal analysis, this research provides a system-level understanding of flood-induced damage mechanisms and offers actionable insights for flood risk mitigation and sustainable conservation of covered bridge heritage in Huizhou and comparable regions worldwide.",

    "Abstract": "This paper numerically analyses numerous parameters with the most sensitive impact on the in-plane lateral behaviour of light timber-framed (LTF) wall elements. Different types of sheathing material (fibre-plaster boards, OSB) are studied according to the parametrically chosen distance between the fasteners, using three different calculation procedures: (a) a previously developed semi-analytical procedure using the Modified Gamma Method (MGM) accounts for bending, shear, and timber-to-framing connection flexibility simultaneously; (b) a previously developed FEM Spring Model as the most accurate approach; and (c) in this study, a specially developed innovative FEM 2D Hinge Model using the two-dimensional hinge layer to simulate the deformability between the sheathing boards and the timber frame, which enables significantly faster FEM analysis compared to the already developed FEM Spring Model. This, in turn, realistically allows for much faster analysis of real multi-storey timber structures. In order to only judge the influence of the sheathing material and fastener disposition, in all cases, the tensile and compressive vertical supports are considered to be stiff-supported wall elements as prescribed by the valid Eurocode 5 standard; however, it is possible to additionally include all three possible supporting flexibilities. The study places particular emphasis on the deformation of sliding fasteners between the sheathing boards and the timber frame, which arises from fastener flexibility and can significantly reduce the overall in-plane stiffness of LTF wall elements. For specially selected parametric values of fastener spacing (s = 20, 37.5, 75, and 150 mm), parametric FEM analysis using a special 2D hinge layer is additionally developed and performed to validate the previously developed semi-analytical expressions by the MGM for the in-plane wall stiffness, which seems to be the most appropriate for designing engineering implementation. All applied approaches to modelling wall elements considered the same parameters for evaluating the stiffness of an individual wall element, which represents a fundamental input parameter in the modelling of frame wall elements within the overall structure. The aim of the study is to determine the most suitable and accurate model, as the response of the entire structure to horizontal loading depends on the design of the individual wall element. Among these, it has been demonstrated that the thickness of the load-bearing timber frame and the type of resisting LTF walls (internal or external) have practically no significant effect on the in-plane stiffness of such wall elements. Consequently, the type of sheathing material (FPB or OSB) and especially the spacing between the fasteners are much more sensitive parameters, which would probably need to be given further consideration in future FEM studies.",

    "Abstract": "Antisolvent crystallization is a promising method for recovering rare earth elements (REEs). While it offers high theoretical yields of Y2(SO4)3·nH2O from aqueous leach solutions, the recovery is constrained by kinetic limitations. This study examined the crystallization of Y2(SO4)3·nH2O in a fluidized bed reactor (FBR) using ethanol, focusing on the effects of the organic-to-aqueous (O/A) ratio and flow rates on yield and crystal properties. O/A ratios of 0.9 and 1.1 were investigated with an initial Y3+ concentration of 0.87 g/L and a crystallization time of 3 h. The system exhibits multiple rate-limiting steps. At low O/A ratios (0.9), extended induction times indicate either nucleation rate-limitations despite high supersaturation or the possible formation of an initial metastable phase, requiring extended crystallization time for near-equilibrium yields. At high O/A (1.1), elevated supersaturation accelerates nucleation and achieves ~82% yield in 3 h; however, crystal growth exhibited a remaining rate limitation. Lower supersaturation and slower mixing at O/A = 0.9 favored growth, producing crystals with D50 &gt; 34 µm. This work explores how operational parameters influence crystallization behavior while achieving practical yields and acceptable crystal characteristics within a reasonable timeframe. The FBR provided controlled operation, enabling consistent product formation and process flexibility.",

    "Abstract": "Sok Chan Forest, located in Lao Suea Kok District, Ubon Ratchathani Province, Thailand, is frequently affected by wildfires during the dry season, resulting in significant environmental degradation and adverse impacts on the livelihoods of local communities. In this study, we outline the development of a prototype wildfire early warning system utilizing LoRa technology to address the long-distance data transmission limitations that are commonly encountered when using conventional Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. The proposed system comprises sensor nodes that communicate from peer to peer with a central node, which subsequently relays the collected data to a remote database server via the internet. Real-time alerts are disseminated through both a smartphone application and a web-based platform, thereby facilitating timely notification of authorities and community members. Field experiments in Sok Chan Forest demonstrated reliable single-hop communication with a 100% packet delivery ratio at distances up to 1500 m, positive SNR, and RSSI levels above receiver sensitivity, as well as sub-second end-to-end detection latency in both single- and two-hop configurations. A controlled alarm accuracy evaluation yielded an overall classification accuracy of 91.7%, with perfect precision for the Fire class, while a user study involving five software development experts and fifteen firefighters yielded an average effectiveness score of 3.84, reflecting a high level of operational efficacy.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a control architecture based on Pixhawk4 to address the transition mode control issue of a tilt-rotor tricopter. While the classical PID controller designed for the rotor mode can handle most engineering applications under normal environmental conditions, it does not fully consider disturbances such as those arising from internal perturbations or the external environment. In response, this paper proposes a controller design with disturbance observation to meet the robustness requirements of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) under perturbed conditions. For the state-constrained control problem of the UAV, the original model is simplified, and a three-channel model for control purposes is introduced. By incorporating a barrier Lyapunov function, the state constraint problem of the UAV is solved, ensuring a smooth transition from rotor mode to fixed-wing mode. To address the high complexity of virtual control law derivatives in backstepping control, a filter is used to estimate the derivatives of the UAV′s virtual states, and a linear extended state observer is introduced to estimate external and transitional disturbances during flight. Lyapunov theory is employed to ensure the closed-loop stability of the control scheme. Finally, inspired by the hunting process of aquilas, the Aquila Optimizer (AO) optimization algorithm is applied to optimize the controller’s hyperparameters, further enhancing the reliability and transient performance of the control system.",

    "Abstract": "Urban recreational lakes require systematic microbiological monitoring to ensure public health protection and agreement with bathing-water regulations. This study investigates the spatial variability in fecal indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli and intestinal enterococci) at two major urban bathing sites in Zagreb, Croatia (Lake Bundek and Lake Jarun), using a four-year monitoring dataset (2016–2019) collected at 19 fixed sampling locations. E. coli was quantified using a miniaturized most probable number (MPN) method, while intestinal enterococci were determined by membrane filtration, following ISO standards. Microbiological concentrations were log10-transformed and analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test for statistically significant differences among sampling locations within each lake. Variability in microbiological data was characterized using box-and-whisker plots, which appropriately represent dispersion and skewness typical of MPN- and CFU-based measurements. The results indicate predominantly homogeneous spatial distributions of both indicators, particularly at Lake Jarun, where no statistically significant differences among sampling locations were observed. In contrast, a statistically significant spatial difference in E. coli concentrations was detected at Lake Bundek, likely reflecting site-specific characteristics such as smaller lake size and more limited water exchange.",

    "Abstract": "This work deals with the impact of surface acoustic treatment (holes and grooves) and primary material (plywood, MDF, solid wood panel) of acoustic panels on their fire characteristics. Fire characteristics were determined based on the cone calorimeter method, single-flame source test, and smoke generation assessment. In general, birch plywood demonstrated the highest values for heat release rate (HRR), maximum average rate of heat emission (MARHE), and effective heat of combustion (EHC), indicating its higher flammability compared to the other tested materials. MDF generally exhibited the lowest values for heat release rate (HRR) and maximum average rate of heat emission (MARHE); yet, under certain perforated configurations, it generated the highest amount of smoke. Solid wood panels exhibited the lowest heat release rate (HRR) but developed the largest charred areas during the single-flame source test. Among the surface treatments, the 16/8 mm treatment resulted in the highest values of effective heat of combustion (EHC) and maximum average rate of heat emission (MARHE), while the 8/1.5–15T treatment exhibited the most rapid increase in heat release rate (HRR), attributed to the swift degradation of its thin surface layer and high void fraction. The presence of holes and grooves increased smoke production, which was most evident in MDF and plywood panels. The results demonstrate that acoustic surface geometry significantly modifies the fire behavior of wood-based panels and should be considered alongside material selection when evaluating fire safety in interior applications.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the critical role of resonance capture dynamics in determining the energy dissipation performance of nonlinear energy sinks (NES). A fluid inerter combining mass amplification and damping characteristics is proposed as a core component, based on which two configurations of fractional-order NES (configured in series and parallel) are systematically constructed. The applicability of the complex averaging method in fractional-order systems has been addressed through fractional calculus (such as Leibniz properties), enabling it to be analyzed like integer-order systems. Employing the multi-scale perturbation method, the energy transfer mechanism between the primary oscillator and the NES is derived, leading to the analytical determination of optimal cubic stiffness and maximum energy transfer efficiency. Comparative simulation shows that the parameters of the inerter directly affect the magnitude of critical damping. The optimal cubic stiffness design method is more reliable than traditional methods and can ensure effective target energy transfer triggering. Further analysis of dissipation time shows that the performance of fractional-order NES is superior to integer-order NES; notably, the dissipation time of series fractional-order NES is significantly shorter than that of parallel and traditional NES. In summary, this study provides theoretical guidance for the design of lightweight and high-performance NES and will also promote the application of fractional calculus theory in the field of engineering vibration reduction.",

However, the function of cyp307A1 in crustaceans remains unclear. In this study, we explored the function of Eccyp307a1 in Exopalaemon carinicauda through a series of experiments. The sequence of Eccyp307a1 encoded 529 amino acids, and the protein was found to possess typical P450 domains and heme-binding sites. The mRNA of Eccyp307a1 was expressed at a higher level during the early stages of ovary development, but was expressed less during the mature stage. Furthermore, employing eyestalk ablation and RNAi experiments, we determined that Eccyp307a1 could be regulated by neuroendocrine factors and is essential for the normal initiation of ovary development. These findings provided insights into the gene function of Eccyp307a1 in early ovary development in E. carinicauda, and our study further elucidates the molecular mechanisms of ovary development in crustaceans.",

    "Abstract": "Advantageous functions have been attributed to amyloid β, which helps explain its expression despite a propensity to aggregate. Besides supporting cognitive processes, it has antimicrobial activity, e.g., amyloid β can entrap pathogens or disrupt their membranes. Since iron is an essential element for invading organisms, limiting its availability is an antimicrobial strategy. This can be achieved by various means, such as reducing circulating iron, as is the case for anemia of inflammation or anemia of chronic disease, which may occur in Alzheimer’s disease. The protein lactoferrin both sequesters iron and generates proteolytic fragments with antimicrobial properties, and amyloid β may have similar traits. Amyloid β, which is derived from proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein, directly inhibits microorganisms. In addition, it binds redox-active metals, such as iron and copper. After being generated, amyloid β can enter the interstitial fluid and undergo clearance by a variety of mechanisms (e.g., glymphatic system, transport across the blood–brain barrier, and uptake by microglia or astrocytes). This clearance, together with its small size and iron-binding properties, positions amyloid β to perform a surveillance function to access, capture, and export labile iron. By removing extraneous iron, amyloid β also helps to limit metal-catalyzed reactions that cause tissue damage. In summary, besides preventing the aggregation and neurotoxicity of amyloid β, the clearance of amyloid β from the CNS may serve a surveillance function to remove loosely bound iron to avert injury by redox reactions and enable amyloid β to function as a mammalian siderophore making iron unavailable to invading microorganisms.",

To support this proposal, we first (1) introduce arthropods and showcase their deep evolutionary history and tremendous diversity. Next, we (2) briefly discuss the role of arthropods in the history of human innovation and highlight some of the challenges they have helped us overcome. We provide select examples of the importance and innovation of arthropods in food, medicine, agriculture, materials, and technology. We then discuss (3) arthropods and grand challenges, articulating how they are both part of the problem and key to the solution. (4) We discuss multiple models for creating transdisciplinary research teams—1. challenge-focused, 2. taxon-focused, and 3. innovatively open-ended with respect to challenge and taxon—and the scales at which they can be created—local/regional/global. Finally, (5) we suggest that arthropods can provide a centering focal point for transdisciplinary research; an inspirational magnet that can pull together distinct scholars to coalesce and collaborate around a common nature-based theme. Our strategic next steps include exploring open-ended arthropod-focused research teams, as they would be well-positioned to tackle multiple solution-based collaborations, and such collaborations are likely to lead to novel discoveries and nature-inspired innovations.",

Data was analysed using constructivist grounded theory principles, leading to the development of an ecological theory of older adults’ well-being within the context of a health crisis at three interconnected levels: individual, community, and societal. Individual resources, such as adaptability and support systems, contributed to enhancing and maintaining their well-being. Community support and a sense of belonging were essential to meet the needs of people in later life, whilst necessary social health protection measures during the pandemic restricted social activities, further impacting well-being, mostly perceived as challenging. Cultural differences and societal support systems shaped participants’ experiences. The study emphasises the interdependence of the different levels in impacting older adults’ well-being, offers strategies for policy and practice, and advocates and contributes for the development of gerontological theories in the context of health crises.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) represents a precancerous condition whose effective management is crucial for preventing invasive cervical cancer, a disease that remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. The long pre-invasive phase of cervical carcinogenesis and the availability of effective screening and treatment procedures make CIN a largely preventable and curable entity. Objectives: This review aimed to analyze therapeutic options applied in CIN, correlating interventions with lesion grade and guideline recommendations, in order to outline a management model adapted to the Romanian clinical setting. Materials and Methods: A structured narrative review of 20 published articles addressing cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 1–3) published between 2021 and 2023 was performed. Relevant studies were identified through a targeted literature search and analyzed descriptively. This study synthesized data from the recent literature and international clinical guidelines to identify management trends and context-specific adaptations. Results: Extracted variables included lesion grade, reported therapeutic approach (surveillance, excisional, or ablative treatment), reproductive considerations, and patient compliance, with international guidelines used as reference standards. Across the reviewed studies, excisional procedures (conization and LEEP) were predominantly reported for high-grade neoplasia (CIN 2–3), while low-grade lesions (CIN 1) were managed either conservatively or through close surveillance. Treatment decisions described in the literature were strongly influenced by patient age, fertility preservation needs, and obstetric history. Overall, management approaches reported in Romanian and international studies were broadly aligned with current guideline recommendations, although variations were observed in the expectant management of younger patients. Conclusions: The findings emphasize the importance of individualized management in cervical dysplasia, integrating lesion characteristics with patient-specific factors. While international guidelines provide a robust framework, their adaptation to the Romanian healthcare context should prioritize patient education, compliance, and structured post-treatment follow-up strategies.",

We found that the chromosomes retained their lampbrush morphology, and the phosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II resided on the lateral loops. Transcription on the lateral loops was reduced but detectable at cold conditions and significantly increased when the oocytes were transferred at room temperature. Satellite S1a transcripts were detected at the lateral loops of the chromosomes by RNA FISH.

    "Abstract": "Differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) is the most common malignant endocrine tumor, with a generally favorable prognosis. Imaging, including iodine radioactive isotope scintigraphy (IRIS), is crucial for diagnosis and follow-up. While 131I has long been used for both therapeutic and diagnostic purposes, 123I is reserved for diagnostic imaging due to its shorter half-life and γ emissions. This review highlights the utility of 123I scintigraphy, especially in pre-treatment assessment and dosimetry for DTC. It is particularly valuable before radioiodine (RAI) ablation, providing accurate imaging in patients with iodine-refractory (IR) or biochemically incomplete response (BIR) DTC. When compared to post-therapeutic 131I scans, 123I scintigraphy appears to have a lower sensitivity for detecting metastatic lesions, particularly in lymph nodes and lungs. However, its diagnostic performance compared to low-dose diagnostic 131I is more variable, with some studies suggesting superiority due to the absence of stunning. Further research is needed to standardize its use and optimize its role in guiding DTC management.",

    "Abstract": "It is promising to in situ retrofit the activated sludge process with a membrane bioreactor (MBR) to increase treatment capacity and improve effluent quality in a textile dyeing wastewater treatment plant (WWTP). Membrane selection among commercial products for real engineering applications is critical for this specific wastewater, and little information is available in the literature. This study systematically evaluated the application potential of two flat-sheet microfiltration membranes made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyether sulfone (PES) in pilot-scale MBRs for in situ retrofitting textile dyeing WWTP. During the four stages with different loads, both membranes achieved nearly the same effluent quality and rejection performance. Both membranes showed little trans-membrane pressure (TMP) increase at an average flux of 15 L/(m2·h) with sub-critical flux characteristics, and showed a sharp TMP increase with super-critical flux characteristics observed at an average flux of 18/22.5 L/(m2·h). After 74 d of filtration, at an average sludge concentration of 12,000 g/L, the PVDF membrane showed less variation in pore size distribution and bubble point pressure, while the PES membrane showed less change in permeability and contact angle. Both membranes met general MBR requirements due to the minimizing pristine effects of both membranes by this specific wastewater matrix. The PVDF membrane showed better anti-fouling capability, especially during high-/over-load stages, and thus was suggested for MBR retrofit, with a sustainable membrane flux below 18 L/(m2·h).",

    "Abstract": "Accurate and efficient frequency estimation is essential in many scientific fields and has led to the development of various algorithms. Commonly used methods involve applying the Discrete Fourier Transform followed by spectral interpolation. This approach faces challenges especially under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To mitigate this limitation, the Generalized Fractional Interpolated Discrete Fourier Transform for frequency estimation of rectangular-windowed sinewaves is proposed. This non-iterative algorithm enhances frequency estimation by employing spectral components at fractional steps of the Discrete Fourier Transform frequency resolution. A non-iterative, closed-form equation for frequency estimation is derived, enabling efficient computation. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through numerical simulations and compared with existing interpolation methods for different frequencies, signal-to-noise ratios, and number of acquired samples. The method is validated using experimentally acquired sinewave signals.",

    "Abstract": "The present study is dedicated to exploring key factors impacting US pet owners’ preferences for brand, price, country of origin, and health and nutrition claims as important extrinsic and credence attributes. Pet engagement and subjective and objective knowledge, as well as varying forms of pet humanisation behaviour, were thought to be suitable factors. The study is of an explorative and quantitative nature, rooted in an online consumer survey, descriptive statistics, and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). To strengthen the PLS-SEM model, relative preference shares derived from a best–worst analysis were integrated into the model. The results with the strongest effect sizes indicate that US pet owners’ objective knowledge is positively associated with pet non-humanisation behaviour, those who actively engage with their pet are positively associated with loving humanisation behaviour, and that health and nutritional claims on pet food are less important for those reporting non-humanisation behaviours. The analysis between the varying types of pet humanisation behaviours and the best–worst-derived relative preferences for extrinsic and credence attributes provides a diverse picture. Together, the results suggest that pet engagement and both subjective and objective knowledge are associated with pet humanisation behaviour, which are differentially linked to the importance of pet food product attributes. Best practice recommendations for marketers in the pet food industry are provided.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolizes approximately 30–50% of clinically used drugs; thus, accurate prediction of CYP3A4 inhibition is essential for early assessment of drug–drug interaction (DDI) risk and toxicity. This study evaluated an integrated artificial intelligence framework for predicting CYP3A4 inhibition (%) using a large, curated chemical dataset. Methods: A dataset of 23,713 compounds was compiled from the Korea Chemical Bank and multiple commercial and public databases. Vector-based machine learning (ML) models (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a weighted ML ensemble) and graph neural network (GNN) models (O-GNN with contrastive learning and manifold mixup (O-GNN + CL + Mixup), D-MPNN, GINE, and GATv2) were evaluated. Manifold mixup was applied during GNN training, and SMILES enumeration-based test-time augmentation was used at inference. The best-performing ML and GNN models were integrated using a weighted ensemble strategy. Model interpretability was examined using SHAP analysis for ML models and occlusion sensitivity analysis for O-GNN + CL + Mixup. Results: The weighted ML ensemble achieved the best performance among ML models (RMSE = 19.1031, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) = 0.7566); the O-GNN + CL + Mixup model performed the best among GNN models (RMSE = 20.1002, PCC = 0.7265). The hybrid model achieved improved predictive accuracy (RMSE = 19.0784, PCC = 0.7570). External validation on 100 newly generated experimental data points confirmed generalizability (Custom Metric = 0.8035). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that integrating ML and GNN models with data augmentation strategies improves the robustness and interpretability of CYP3A4 inhibition prediction and established a practical framework for metabolic screening and DDI risk assessment.",

    "Abstract": "Efficiently separating propene and propane is paramount for the chemical industry but notoriously difficult due to their minimal size and volatility differences. Here, an efficient strategy to overcome this separation challenge was demonstrated through the design of bimetallic zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF)-based mixed-matrix membranes (MMMs). Thin-film composite (TFC) membranes were fabricated by integrating monometallic ZIF-8, ZIF-67, and a synergistic bimetallic ZIF-8-67 into a uniquely formulated ionic liquid–cellulose acetate (IL–CA) polymer matrix. Structural and morphological analyses confirmed the high crystallinity of the ZIF fillers and their seamless integration within the polymer. The resultant ZIF-8-67/IL-CA membrane exhibited notable separation performance, surpassing its monometallic counterparts by a threefold increase in both C3H6 permeance and C3H6/C3H8 ideal selectivity relative to the base membrane. Under industrially relevant mixed-gas testing, the membrane achieved a competitive separation factor of eight for propene over propane. These findings reveal that the strategic integration of bimetallic nodes in ZIFs can unlock synergistic properties unattainable with single-metal frameworks. This work presents a robust and scalable platform for developing next-generation membranes that defy conventional performance trade-offs, paving the way for efficient membrane-based olefin/paraffin separations.",

It is well known that there is indeed a deep mathematical link between the two, via the vector composition of angular momenta and rotational symmetry. Random walks are considered in the framework of an interpretation of the probability of microstates in statistical physics. The ideas presented in this work aim to illustrate the relevance of this perspective for modeling angular momentum in atomic physics.",

    "Abstract": "China has made significant progress in paleontological heritage conservation. However, research and conservation efforts have predominantly focused on exquisitely preserved, movable specimens of high scientific value, leading to the relative neglect of in situ paleontological geosites which are critical for understanding fossil distribution patterns. To address this gap, this study employs a GIS approach to conduct a multifaceted spatial analysis of paleontological geosites in the BTH region as a representative case study. Our results reveal a pronounced spatiotemporal imbalance in the distribution of these geosites. Furthermore, their spatial configuration exhibits significant correlations with key physiographic factors—including elevation, stratigraphic distribution, and slope—as well as socioeconomic indicators such as population density, GDP density, and fiscal self-reliance ratio. This uneven distribution creates substantial conservation challenges, resulting in fragmented governance, a mismatch between local conservation capacities and needs, and potential biases in protection priorities toward specific regions or geological periods. In the BTH region, the distribution patterns of paleontological geosites are jointly shaped by physiographic, socioeconomic, and anthropogenic process factors. Elucidating the relationships between these drivers and the spatial distribution of geosites constitutes a critical foundation for advancing their scientific conservation and sustainable management. Drawing on broader interdisciplinary insights, currently peripheral paleontological heritage can be further transformed into strategic and sustainable resources.",

    "Abstract": "The study examines the relationship between entrepreneurial education and society’s approach to green energy. The findings highlight the crucial importance of this process for promoting an ecological and responsible economy. The starting point is the assumption that entrepreneurial competencies, particularly innovation and communication competencies and learning ability, can foster the perception of RES technologies as solutions that combine economic profitability with environmental benefits. Based on a literature review, a research gap was identified regarding the insufficient number of empirical analyses demonstrating the relationship between entrepreneurship education, key competencies, and attitudes toward renewable energy technologies. The study is quantitative in nature and is based on the analysis of survey data collected among high school and university students. The obtained results indicate that the effectiveness of entrepreneurship education is determined by the interaction of individual competencies and environmental conditions. Innovation and communication competencies and learning ability enhance educational outcomes, while technological barriers can significantly limit their positive impact. The analysis highlights the importance of a supportive institutional environment for the effective utilization of educational potential. On this basis, recommendations were formulated for the design of entrepreneurial education programs, emphasizing the need to integrate content related to renewable energy sources, the development of future competences and the reduction in technological barriers as elements supporting the transformation towards sustainable development.",

    "Abstract": "Semiconductor manufacturing is a resource and energy-intensive industry with a substantial environmental footprint. To address the footprint, we present a methodology for quantifying the environmental impact of semiconductor unit processes using the Environmental Footprint 3.1 Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) framework, focusing on identifying improvement opportunities in process steps with less sensitivity to defects. We apply this methodology to backside wet cleaning by proposing an alternative single-wafer process that adopts ozonated chemistries. The assessment used primary data from imec’s 300 mm pilot line. Results show that the proposed process reduces the total environmental footprint by 55% compared to the baseline Spin Cleaning with Repetitive use of Ozonated water and Diluted HF process. Key reductions include 67% less electricity for cleaning, 59% less HF use, and a 31% reduction in ultrapure water consumption. When scaled to a facility producing N28 Logic wafers at 50,000 wafer starts per month, with 46 backside clean steps per processed wafer, the process achieves annual savings of approximately 4 million kWh of electricity and 28 million liters (28,000 m3) of tap water per year. A sensitivity analysis revealed that replacing fossil-based electricity with hydroelectric power further reduces total environmental impacts by up to 63%, emphasizing the benefit of combining process innovation with renewable energy sourcing.",

    "Abstract": "Supplier assessment plays a pivotal role in various sectors and is a key component of supply chain management (SCM); however, it combines complexities and challenges associated with uncertainty and dynamic requirements. Several studies have applied various methods to assess suppliers; however, their calculations are complex. Therefore, this work introduces a new hybrid method, depending on the full consistency method (FUCOM) with triangular fuzzy numbers (TrFNs) to consistently prioritize supplier assessment criteria, using the distance from the ideal assessment criterion to assess various suppliers, as well as to handle uncertainty. The proposed method is applied to a practical case study, and the results show that it prioritizes the assessment criteria, reflecting stakeholder preferences. Moreover, it enables decision makers to construct a set of decision matrices and take into account various viewpoints, and it uses simple, detailed steps with TOPSIS, thus avoiding confusion. Additionally, the results indicate that the use of the FUCOM-TrFNs provides consistent weights and a robust tool for imprecise problems, with fewer comparisons and less confusion during calculations. Ultimately, the findings provide valuable insights for assessing and selecting suitable suppliers with a more applicable method.",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an injectable combination of hyaluronic acid and amino acids for treating GSM-related symptoms. In this prospective, multicenter study, 84 women aged 46–60 with moderate to severe VVA confirmed by gynecological examination received three intradermal treatments at 21-day intervals, targeting the vestibule, introitus, lower vaginal wall, and labia majora. Symptom severity was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS), while tolerability and satisfaction were evaluated via a five-point Likert scale. Quality of life was measured using the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). Assessments were conducted at baseline, after each injection, and at 3- and 6-month follow-up visits. After three months, significant improvements were noted in vaginal dryness, itching, burning, and dyspareunia (all p &lt; 0.001). Patient satisfaction increased from 59.0% to 80.7%, and SWLS scores rose from 4.57 ± 1.76 to 6.53 ± 1.10, reflecting enhanced quality of life. The treatment was well tolerated and demonstrated a favorable safety profile. These findings suggest that this injectable formulation may represent an effective, non-hormonal option for women with VVA, particularly those who are not candidates for hormone therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) and Mixed Reality (MR) technologies present promising opportunities for enhancing anatomy education, for example by supporting learner-generated drawing tasks. This study investigated the impact of AR- and MR-supported drawing on drawing performance, learning outcomes, and the overall learning experience, in comparison to traditional instructor-guided drawing. A total of 73 medical students were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: traditional drawing (Control), AR-supported drawing, MR-supported drawing, and MR with stereoscopic 3D visualization. The results showed that both AR- and MR-supported drawing conditions effectively reduced extraneous cognitive load, enhanced intrinsic motivation, and improved drawing accuracy. However, no significant differences in knowledge acquisition were found across the four groups. Interestingly, in the stereoscopic 3D visualization condition, learners with higher intrinsic motivation demonstrated poorer learning performance. This suggests that their attention may have been diverted toward interacting with the system rather than focusing on conceptual understanding. Furthermore, visuospatial ability and prior knowledge moderated the effectiveness of AR/MR interventions, with more experienced learners gaining greater benefits. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating both learning performance and learner experience. They also emphasize the need to tailor AR/MR-based educational tools to individual learner characteristics in order to maximize their educational impact.",

    "Abstract": "Aim: To evaluate the real-world effectiveness of prophylactic metoclopramide in preventing opioid-induced nausea and vomiting (OINV) during the initial phase of strong opioid therapy in opioid-naïve patients with cancer-related pain. Methods: This retrospective, single-center observational cohort study included adult patients with pathologically confirmed malignancies who initiated strong opioid therapy between January 2023 and December 2024. Patients were categorized into a prophylactic metoclopramide group or a no-prophylaxis control group. Complete control (CC) of OINV during the first 7 days was defined as the absence of nausea, vomiting, and rescue antiemetic use. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with CC, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, cancer subtype, cancer stage, comorbidity status, and morphine-equivalent daily dose (MEDD). Subgroup analyses were conducted based on age, sex, and cancer subtype. Results: A total of 244 patients were included, of whom 199 received prophylactic metoclopramide, and 45 received no prophylaxis. The prophylactic group achieved significantly higher CC rates than the control group (74.9% vs. 37.8%, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression confirmed that prophylactic metoclopramide was independently associated with higher odds of achieving CC (adjusted OR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.10–0.40; p &lt; 0.001). Similar improvements were observed for nausea and vomiting control. Subgroup analyses demonstrated consistent benefits across age and sex groups, with particularly notable effects in patients with gastrointestinal cancers. Conclusions: Prophylactic metoclopramide significantly improves OINV control in opioid-naïve patients with cancer-related pain during the initiation of strong opioids. These findings support the rational use of early antiemetic prophylaxis in routine clinical practice. Prospective randomized trials are warranted to validate these real-world results and assess long-term safety.",

    "Abstract": "This commentary discusses a recent article (J Diabetes 2025;17(3):e70063), focusing on interpreting the study’s sex-stratified results in a broader clinical and mechanistic context. The authors of this systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials demonstrate that women achieve greater weight loss induced by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists compared to men (mean difference of 1.04 kg or 1.69%). Analyses specific to different drugs consistently show that women benefit more from dulaglutide, liraglutide, semaglutide, and retatrutide, with trials focused on obesity further emphasizing this gap. Sensitivity analyses confirm the reliability of these findings and indicate the absence of publication bias. We discuss the clinical implications of these results, suggesting that healthcare providers should consider sex differences when counseling, monitoring, and dosing patients. We also advocate for future trials that are adequately powered and stratified by sex to evaluate factors such as adherence, adverse events, and body composition. Mechanistic hypotheses, such as sex-related pharmacokinetics, estrogen-GLP-1 synergy, and varying inflammatory responses, should be investigated further to inform precision dosing. Lastly, we recommend that regulatory agencies revisit current labeling, which claims no sex differences, as more sex-stratified evidence becomes available. It is important to acknowledge the existing heterogeneity and remaining uncertainties in this area of research.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), which will begin its scientific operations around 2027, is going to survey the sky area of the median-to-high Galactic latitude and median-to-high ecliptic latitude. The high astrometric precision of the CSST Survey Camera for faint objects enables the detection of a number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around M dwarfs and brown dwarfs via differential astrometry in its optical survey. In this paper, we predict the number of giant planets and brown dwarfs around stars and brown dwarfs detectable with CSST astrometry. We generate synthetic samples of CSST stellar and substellar sources, and carry out companion injection-recovery simulations in the samples using different occurrence rates for FGK dwarfs, M dwarfs, and brown dwarfs. We calculate companion yields based on CSST astrometric precision. Our analysis reveals that over its 10 yr mission, the CSST Survey Camera could barely discover giant planets and low-mass BDs around FGK dwarfs, but is projected to detect 20−170 giant planets and low-mass brown dwarfs around M dwarfs within 300 pc, and 300−570 brown dwarf binaries within 600 pc. Therefore, CSST astrometry is likely to significantly increase the current sample of substellar companions around M dwarfs and brown dwarfs. This sample will deepen our understanding of planet formation and evolution around low-mass stars and brown dwarfs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We considered the kink oscillations of coronal magnetic loops, which form a coronal loop arcade with a magnetic shear. In this structure, the magnetic field consists of helical lines. A semicircular magnetic slab model was used, and the corresponding dispersion relation was derived. To study oscillations of an individual sigmoid loop, we focused on the quasi-perpendicular propagation limit. Two fast surface waves, denoted FSW + and FSW − , were found to couple with the Alfvén mode when the magnetic shear parameter α is nonzero. The FSW + mode corresponds to the vertical kink mode and its frequency is close to the kink frequency. In the propagating regime, the frequency of the forward wave increases with increasing magnetic shear, and that of the backward wave has more complex behavior. The real frequencies of the forward and backward waves in the FSW + mode exist up to certain values of the magnetic shear parameter. For a larger shear, the frequencies are complex values. The eigenfrequencies of the quasi-standing FSW + mode were found to increase slightly as the shear parameter increases, and the effect is most prominent for the fundamental mode. The obtained results are relevant in the context of seismological use of the propagating and standing kink waves in sigmoid coronal loops.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We present the discovery of a young, close-in companion to the early B-type Herbig Be star MWC 340 (V1685 Cyg), a rare system known to host a protoplanetary disk. Herbig Be stars often show complex circumstellar environments shaped by accretion and multiplicity. Using near-infrared (NIR) interferometric observations with the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) array over 5 yr in the H band ( λ = 1.5–1.7 μ m) and K band ( λ = 2.1–2.4 μ m), we resolve the binary and constrain its orbital and stellar properties through image reconstruction, model fitting, and spectral energy distribution analysis. Orbital modeling suggests a 16 yr minimum period and a 27.5 mas projected separation (≈25 au). Assuming an M A+B = 14.65 M ⊙ total mass, we find a best-fit semimajor axis of 21 mas and eccentricity e = 0.69. The reconstructed images reveal a slightly elongated primary that is roughly 3 times brighter than the secondary (flux B/A = 0.28 in the H band, 0.3 in the K band), contributing 65% of the NIR flux. The secondary contributes 21%, with the remainder from extended emission. Stellar photospheres account for only ∼20% of total H - and K -band emission. Isochrone fitting yields masses and ages of 7.5–9 M ⊙ , 0.13–0.19 Myr for the primary, and 5.8–7 M ⊙ , 0.28–0.45 Myr for the secondary, suggesting non-coevality unless the secondary is more extinguished. The apparent age discrepancy and high eccentricity ruled out by mass constraints may reflect differential reddening or point to dynamical influence from an unresolved third component. Continued CHARA monitoring and Gaia astrometry will help clarify the system’s architecture.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The characterization of solar wind fluctuations provides insight into magnetofluid turbulence. The slow solar wind with high Alfvénicity, the Alfvénic slow solar wind (ASSW), possesses a similar bulk speed as the slow wind, but with fluctuations largely similar to those found in the fast wind. ASSWs have attracted less attention from the turbulence community compared to fast wind flows. G. P. Zank et al. developed a linear mode decomposition (LMD) technique that identifies eight modes in the magnetized solar wind plasma, namely entropy, fast and slow (+/−) magnetosonic (MS), Alfvén (+/−), and magnetic island modes. Using the LMD technique, we present a comparative study of the characteristic modes found in the ASSW, classical slow solar wind (CSSW), and fast solar wind (FSW) events identified by the WIND spacecraft. We investigate the properties of the eight magnetohydrodynamic modes and their spectral characteristic differences in the three solar wind plasma environments at 1 au. We show that in the CSSW, ASSW, and FSW intervals (i) fast MS mode density fluctuations are dominant compared to entropy and slow MS modes, (ii) magnetic island modes clearly dominate Alfvén modes for the transverse fluctuating magnetic field, and (iii) slow MS modes show no significant power spectral density contribution compared to the Alfvén and fast modes in the frequency spectra for velocity fluctuations. The ASSW exhibits characteristics intermediate to the CSSW and FSW in entropy modes, compressibility, the magnetic island-to-Alfvén mode magnetic energy ratio, and kinetic variance anisotropy and magnetic energy variance anisotropy corresponding to Alfvén modes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Since the observation of the binary neutron star merger GW170817 and the associated kilonova AT2017gfo, the next joint gravitational-wave/optical kilonova has been highly anticipated. Overlapping observations between the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the international gravitational-wave detector network are expected soon. Wide-field survey facilities, such as Rubin, can serve dual roles in gravitational-wave astronomy: conducting dedicated optical counterpart searches following gravitational-wave triggers and, through surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time, providing opportunities for fortuitous kilonova discoveries during routine operations. We use simulations to develop a strategy for identifying kilonova candidates observed by Rubin and processed by the F ink broker. These candidates can be used as astrophysical triggers for a targeted gravitational-wave search. We simulate kilonovae light curves for the first year of Rubin with the latest observing strategy for the Wide-Fast-Deep and the Deep Drilling Fields. Assuming a kilonova rate of 250 Gpc −3 yr −1 , we find that Rubin should observe ∼40 kilonovae per year within the gravitational-wave detector horizon (∼500 Mpc). However, only ∼4 will be received by the brokers with a signal-to-noise ratio larger than 5. Most of these will be faint, and detected 1–2 days following the neutron star merger. Photometric and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited to large telescopes. Using archival data from the Zwicky Transient Facility and our proposed selection criteria, we estimate a minimum contamination of at least 30 events per month from other transients and variables, even under our strictest selection criteria. A deep gravitational-wave search targeting Rubin kilonova candidates may lead to the next multimessenger discovery.",

Maps of 12 CO(2–1) and 13 CO(2–1) emission as well as emission lines of HCN, HNC, HCO + , CN, and CS—many of these detected in these PNs for the first time—reveal the molecular mass distributions, compositions, and velocity fields of the equatorial and, in some cases, polar regions of the sample PNs. In each case, the bulk of the molecular gas traces an expanding equatorial torus, with torus expansion velocities ranging from ∼15 to ∼50 km s −1 and molecular masses from ∼0.002 to ∼0.1 M ⊙ . The inferred molecular torus dynamical ages, which span the range ∼500 yr (Hb 5) to ∼11,000 yr (NGC 2818), provide support for a model wherein molecular torus ejection precedes bipolar lobe formation. Collectively, these ALMA survey results provide insight into the rapid structural evolution as well as the zones of irradiated molecular gas within bipolar PNs that are descended from relatively massive progenitors, likely residing in interacting binary systems, over ∼10 kyr of the post-asymptotic giant branch evolution of such systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In 2013 April, the TeV blazar Markarian 421 underwent one of its most powerful emission outbursts recorded to date. An extensive multi-instrument campaign featuring MAGIC, VERITAS, and NuSTAR provided comprehensive very high-energy (VHE; E &gt; 100 GeV) and X-ray coverage over nine consecutive days. The VHE flux peaked at approximately 15 times that of the Crab Nebula, with rapid variability detected on timescales down to 15 minutes in both X-ray and VHE bands. This rich data set, characterized by its dense temporal coverage and high photon statistics, offers an unparalleled opportunity to probe the broadband emission dynamics in blazars. In this work, we perform a detailed spectral analysis of the X-ray and VHE emissions on subhour timescales throughout the flare. We identify several clockwise spectral hysteresis loops in the X-rays, revealing a spectral evolution more complex than a simple harder-when-brighter trend. The VHE spectrum extends beyond 10 TeV, and its temporal evolution closely mirrors the behavior in the X-rays. Crucially, we report the first evidence of VHE spectral hysteresis occurring simultaneously with the X-ray loops. To interpret these findings, we apply a time-dependent leptonic model to 240 broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) binned on a 15 minute scale, allowing us to self-consistently track the particle distribution’s history. Our modeling shows that the majority of the subhour flux and spectral variations are driven by changes in the luminosity and slope of the injected electron distribution. The required variations in the electron slope are difficult to reconcile with magnetic reconnection, but they are consistent with a shock-acceleration scenario where the shock compression ratio evolves by a factor of ∼2. The model also points to a relatively stable magnetic field and emitting region size, favoring a scenario where the emission originates from a stationary feature in the jet, such as a recollimation shock. However, this scenario requires a jet Lorentz factor that significantly exceeds values from VLBI measurements to account for the high minimum electron energy implied by the lack of variability in the optical band.",

If confirmed, this level of nitrogen enrichment challenges existing models of nucleosynthesis and galaxy evolution. However, the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can affect spectral diagnostics, and previous studies often excluded AGN contamination using photoionization models based on local N/O ratios. In this work, we compare nitrogen-enhanced AGN and H ii region models to observed spectra of eight high-redshift galaxies to constrain their nitrogen abundance, excitation source, gas-phase metallicity, ionization parameter, and gas pressure simultaneously. We find seven galaxies (GHZ9, GS 3073, GN-z9p4, CEERS-1019, GHZ2, GN-z11, and GS-z9-0) are best described by nitrogen-enhanced AGN models, while RXCJ2248-ID is best reproduced by the nitrogen-enhanced H ii model. The presence of AGN does not significantly impact (≲0.1 dex) the derived N/O ratio. We also find that equivalent width—based diagrams are the most robust UV diagnostic diagrams to distinguish AGNs and star-forming galaxies for situations where the nitrogen abundance varies.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Eccentric cavities in circumbinary disks precess on timescales much longer than the binary orbital period. These long-lived steady states can be understood as trapped modes in an effective potential primarily determined by the binary quadrupole and the inner-disk pressure, with associated frequencies ω Q and ω P . Within this framework, we show that the ratio ω P / ω Q is the main parameter determining the mode spectrum, and obtain a thorough understanding of it by systematically solving this problem with various degrees of sophistication. We first find analytical solutions for truncated power-law disks and use this insight in disks with smooth central cavities. Our main findings are as follows: (i) The number of modes increases for thinner disks and more-equal-mass binaries. (ii) For 2D disks, the normalized ground-mode frequency, ω 0 /( ω Q + ω P ), decreases monotonically with the ratio ω P / ω Q . (iii) For thin disks, ω P ≪ ω Q , the ground-mode frequency coincides with the maximum of the effective potential, which tracks the gravitational quadrupole frequency inside the inner-disk cavity, and is thus rather sensitive to the density profile of the cavity, where these modes are localized. (iv) For thick disks, ω P ≫ ω Q , increasing the pressure anchors the peak of the effective potential at the inner cavity radius as the ground-mode extends farther out and its frequency decreases. (v) In agreement with numerical simulations, with ω P / ω Q ≃ 0.1, we find that disk precession is rather insensitive to the density profile, and ground-mode frequencies for 3D disks are about half the value of those for 2D disks.",

These PMs are measured using two epochs of Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging separated by a 7 yr temporal baseline.

We construct reference frames using three different sets of external sources: (1) stars with Gaia Data Release 3 data, (2) stationary background galaxies, and (3) a combination of the two. We show that all three reference frames give consistent PM results.

    "Abstract": "Abstract We present a systematic comparison between the tidal secular evolution timescales predicted by the direct numerical method and those given by the commonly used semianalytic prescriptions implemented in 1D hydrostatic binary evolution codes. Our study focuses on binary systems with intermediate- to high-mass primaries ( M 1 = 5–50 M ⊙ ), companion masses between 1.4 M ⊙ and 10 M ⊙ , and orbital periods ranging from 0.5–50 days. Before mass transfer, both approaches predict synchronization and orbital decay timescales that agree within ∼2 orders of magnitude and typically exceed the stellar main-sequence lifetime, implying negligible tidal impact on secular orbital evolution. However, the implied dissipation channels differ, and the differences become more pronounced once mass transfer begins. To test the theoretical predictions against observations, we apply both approaches to the well-characterized PSR J0045–7319 system, which has an orbital decay timescale of 0.5 Myr. The numerical solution reveals strong resonances with internal gravity waves, bringing the predicted orbital period change rate close to the observed value. In contrast, the semianalytic prescriptions predict orbital decay timescales longer than the Hubble time. These results suggest that for population studies, modestly calibrated parameterized equations may suffice, but for individual systems, reliable interpretation requires direct numerical approaches.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Intracluster light (ICL) is a key component of galaxy clusters, with the potential to trace their dynamical assembly histories and the underlying dark matter distribution. Despite these prospects, its faint nature makes a consensus on its origin or population properties difficult to achieve, both in observations and simulations. In the hope of finding a breakthrough, we utilize the ongoing high-resolution cluster simulation, NewCluster . By classifying billions of particles in and around the cluster with a rigorous tracking procedure, we find that the majority of the ICL originates from satellites, including surviving and disrupted galaxies. Another notable finding is that the preprocessed component follows the density profile of dark matter better than the other components and has distinctive properties: old age, low metallicity, and enhanced α -element abundance. We further investigate the orbital dynamics, and our results demonstrate that the stripped fraction of satellites is primarily determined by the time since infall and the pericenter distance. By linking the demographic, chemical, and orbital properties of ICL stars to their origins, this work proposes a quantitative approach for tracing the assembly history of galaxy clusters from the ICL.",

In classical astrophysical methodology, multiband continuum data are required to derive the dust temperature. The present study aims to investigate the capability and limitations of machine learning techniques in deriving dust temperatures in regions without multiband dust continuum data. We have investigated how the number of pixels used for training influences the prediction accuracy and how the dust temperatures sampled in the training area influence the prediction accuracy. We find that ∼5% of the total number of pixels in the observational region is sufficient for training to obtain accurate predictions. Furthermore, a dust temperature sample within the training area should cover the whole temperature range and have a similar sample distribution to that of the entire observing region for an accurate prediction. The 12 CO/ 13 CO ratio is often found to be the most important feature in predicting the dust temperature. As the 12 CO/ 13 CO ratio is a tracer of photon-dominated regions (PDRs), the machine learning technique could connect the dust temperatures to PDRs. We also find that the condition of the thermal gas–dust coupling is not required for the accurate prediction of the dust temperature from the molecular line data and that machine learning is capable of capturing more information than classical astrophysical concepts.",

We refer to SAWs as energetically dominant sunward-propagating Alfvén waves within inertial range scales. Key parameters such as normalized cross helicity, plasma compressibility, and magnetic compressibility are used to determine the SAWs. Incorporating the polarity of the heliospheric magnetic field, Alfvén wave modes are identified, which enables the determination of the propagation direction. Occurrence rates of SAWs vary from 1% to 14% depending on the timescale and solar wind stream type considered. Particularly, the relationship between large-scale magnetic field switchbacks and SAWs (for a 1 hr long timescale) is investigated. A methodology utilizing pitch angle distributions of suprathermal electron strahl is employed to identify inverted magnetic field topology. The intervals containing SAWs are cross-referenced and examined with intervals identified as switchbacks . For a sample of 1636 1 hr SAW intervals, 17.5% are associated with magnetic field switchbacks occurring at scales larger than 1 hr. The analysis lends support to the idea of switchbacks as one of the candidate sources for a portion of the SAW population.",

However, the properties of the accretion flow and the wind from the Pop III star TDE system are not clear. By performing radiative hydrodynamic simulations, we study the “circularized” accretion flow of the Pop III star TDE system. The masses of the black hole (BH) and the disrupted star are 10 6 and 300 solar masses, respectively. We focus on the properties of the wind. We find that the BH accretion rate is highly super-Eddington. A strong wind is driven by radiation pressure. Due to the presence of a strong wind, only 25%–35% of the fallback debris is accreted by the BH. The remaining part is taken away by the wind. The kinetic power of the wind can be as high as 10 46 erg s −1 . The properties of the wind obtained in this paper may be useful for understanding the radiation properties of Pop III star TDEs in the context of the wind “reprocessing” model.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We study the problem of steady-state spherical accretion onto a black hole, in which the internal energy of the flow is governed by radiation and photon diffusion dominates the energy flux at large radii. In the freefall limit, the fluid equations can admit two types of solutions for a given accretion rate: (1) accretion flows that become isothermal at large radii, and (2) solutions in which the temperature at infinity vanishes as a power law of the radius. Using boundary-layer theory, we obtain analytic solutions for the two cases and apply our results to fallback accretion onto a black hole following a failed supernova (SN) explosion. We give predictions for the observational signature of fallback accretion using realistic progenitor properties from MESA, both for a fully ionized inflow and for the more realistic case in which recombination/ionization take place due to low photospheric temperatures. The observed fading sources coincident with the failed-SNe candidates in NGC 6946 and M31 are too luminous to be powered by spherical accretion onto newly formed black holes; the observed sources are instead likely due to accretion of the turbulent, convective envelope of the supergiant progenitor.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We implement a comprehensive simulation of photon surface interactions using a Monte Carlo approach. This is effective in simulating the interaction of light with telescope mirrors and lenses. We use a full electromagnetic solution to simulate the wavelength and angular dependence at surfaces. This includes bare interfaces, monolayer interfaces, protected layer coatings, and multilayer coatings. We handle special cases when multilayer data are incomplete or when there is photoconversion in the interface as with sensors. We implement interactions with surface microroughness and predict the corresponding angular distribution using a Monte Carlo implementation of the Harvey–Shack scatter theory for a microroughness power spectrum. Finally, we simulate surface interaction with contamination from dust or condensation using Mie scattering applied efficiently to individual contaminants. The combination of these implementations can efficiently simulate rough to polished surfaces of arbitrary materials that are fully cleaned or dusty. The observational consequences include complex wavelength- and spatial-dependent photometric errors, the dominant effect of the wings of point-spread functions (PSFs), dust rings, and wavelength- and angle-dependent throughput losses. We find agreement with the PSF wings of WIYN One Degree Imager observations of bright stars and the properties of dust rings, and demonstrate the ability to disentangle mirror microroughness from the turbulence PSF patterns. The comprehensive numerical implementation of surface interactions has wide applicability in nonastronomical applications as well.",

We present deep MUSE mosaic observations of two nearby gLSBGs with compact elliptical satellites: UGC 1382, which hosts a globally counterrotating gaseous disk, and AGC 192040, which does not. We analyze properties of ionized gas and present spatially resolved maps of kinematics and metallicity, as well as stellar population analysis for the central regions of the galaxies. The radial gradients of gas-phase metallicities are flat for both galaxies. Our observational data indicate that both galaxies experienced mergers several Gyr ago. However, the scenarios of the formation of giant disks appear to be slightly different for these two systems. For AGC 192040, we propose gas accretion from the filament or from the cooling hot halo gas followed by a merger with a companion on a prograde orbit at an intermediate mass ratio. For UGC 1382, multiple gas-rich mergers with companions on retrograde orbits are preferred by the data.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Traditional spectral energy distribution (SED)–fitting methods for stellar mass estimation face persistent challenges including systematic biases and computational constraints. We present a controlled comparison of machine learning (ML) and SED-fitting methods, assessing their accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Using a sample of COSMOS-like galaxies from the Horizon-Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) simulation as a benchmark with known true masses, we evaluate the parametric t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (Pt-SNE) algorithm trained on noise-injected G. Bruzual &amp; S. Charlot models against the established SED-fitting code LePhare. Our results demonstrate that Pt-SNE achieves superior accuracy, with an rms error ( σ F ) of 0.169 dex compared to LePhare’s 0.306 dex. Crucially, Pt-SNE exhibits significantly lower bias (0.029 dex) compared to LePhare (0.286 dex). Pt-SNE also shows greater robustness across all stellar mass ranges, particularly for low-mass galaxies (10 9 ​​​​​​–10 10 M ⊙ ), where it reduces errors by 47%–53%. Even when restricted to only six optical bands, Pt-SNE outperforms LePhare using all 26 available photometric bands, underscoring its superior informational efficiency. Computationally, Pt-SNE processes large data sets ∼3.2 × 10 3 times faster than LePhare. These findings highlight the fundamental advantages of ML methods for stellar mass estimation, demonstrating their potential to deliver more accurate, stable, and scalable measurements for large-scale galaxy surveys.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental physical process operating throughout the Universe, yet its onset in planetary magnetotails remains elusive. Current-sheet flapping is a common dynamic phenomenon in planetary magnetotails, with its roles in driving reconnection largely underexplored. This paper reports the first observation of electron-dominant and ion-coupled reconnection accompanied by current sheet flapping. The Magnetospheric Multiscale mission (MMS) spacecraft was located in the premidnight sector current sheet, which was undergoing kink-mode flapping that propagated duskward, away from the midnight sector, with a frequency of 0.06–0.1 Hz and a wavelength of around 0.5 R E . The flapping led MMS to cross the current sheet repeatedly, from north to south and vice versa. During the initial crossing of the current sheet, distinct electron outflows were observed, while ion responses were weak. This indicates either electron-only reconnection, suggesting an early stage of reconnection (temporal effect) or MMS passing through the exhaust region close to an X-line (spatial effect). Signatures of the electron diffusion region’s limited length, yielding an unusually high aspect ratio, suggest that the former scenario is more likely. Regular ion-coupled reconnection that involves ion outflows became more prominent until MMS eventually crossed the X-line from tailward to earthward. This event indicates a potential causal relationship between electron-only reconnection, current sheet flapping, and subsequent ion reconnection. We discuss feasible mechanisms for current sheet flapping and the feedback between flapping and reconnection, providing new insights into the onset of magnetotail reconnection and cross-scale processes of importance to other heliospheric and astrophysical systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray physics and Astronomy is a new air-shower array experiment under construction in the Bolivian Andes, and its prototype ALPAQUITA surface array has been operating since 2023 April. In addition to the traditional ≥ 3-hit or ≥ 4-hit coincidences to trigger recording air-shower events, ALPAQUITA records the counting rates of the ≥ 1-hit and ≥ 2-hit events (Any1 and Any2, respectively). We report a successful detection of a Forbush decrease (FD) that occurred on 2024 May 10 caused by a passage of an interplanetary shock formed ahead of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection. The amplitude detected in the Any1 rate is 4.26% ± 0.33% at the median primary rigidity of 76 GV, which is consistent with the observations with the worldwide neutron monitor and muon detector networks. Under the assumption of a power-law rigidity spectrum, we renormalized the errors of the observed amplitude ( A obs ) and fitted them as a function of the median primary rigidity ( R m ) of each detector and observational method.

Although a strong geomagnetic storm was observed during this period, we conclude it does not impact our results. Our novel technique realizes a unique coverage to study the behavior of the FDs at the highest rigidity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract It has been proposed that measurements of scattering times ( τ ) from fast radio bursts (FRBs) may be used to infer the FRB host dispersion measure (DM) and its redshift. This approach relies on the existence of a correlation between τ and DM within FRB hosts such as that observed for Galactic pulsars. We assess the measurability of a τ –DM host relation through simulated observations of FRBs within the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP)/Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey, taking into account instrumental effects. We show that even when the FRB hosts intrinsically follow the τ –DM relation measured for pulsars, this correlation cannot be inferred from FRB observations; this limitation arises mostly from the large variance around the average cosmic DM value given by the Macquart relation, the variance within the τ –DM relation itself, and observational biases against large τ values. We argue that theoretical relations have little utility as priors on redshift, e.g., for purposes of galaxy identification, and that the recent lack of an observed correlation between scattering and DM in the ASKAP/CRAFT survey is not unexpected, even if our understanding of a τ –DM host relation is correct.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a central role in many astrophysical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), including star formation and cosmic-ray transport and acceleration. MHD turbulence can be decomposed into three fundamental modes—fast, slow, and Alfvén—each contributing differently to the dynamics of the medium. However, characterizing and separating the energy fractions of these modes was challenging due to the limited 2D information available from observations. To address this difficulty, we use 3D isothermal and multiphase MHD turbulence simulations to examine how mode energy fractions vary under different physical conditions. Overall, we find that the Alfvén and slow modes carry comparable kinetic-energy fractions and together dominate the turbulent energy budget in multiphase media, while the fast mode contributes the smallest fraction. Relative to isothermal conditions, multiphase simulations exhibit an enhanced fast-mode energy fraction. We further introduce a machine learning–based approach that employs a conditional residual neural network to infer these fractions directly from spectroscopic data. The method leverages the fact that the three MHD modes imprint distinct morphological signatures in spectroscopic maps owing to their differing contributions to density and velocity fluctuations. Our model is trained on a suite of isothermal and multiphase simulations covering typical ISM conditions. We demonstrate that our machine learning model can recover the mode fractions from spectroscopic observables, achieving mean relative normalized errors of approximately 0 and standard deviations of 0.01–0.02 for seen data and 0.1–1.8 for unseen data.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We present high-resolution profiles of the H α , [N II ], and [O III ] lines of supernova remnants (SNRs) in M33. The 8 km s −1 resolution allows us to separate emission from the photoionized shock precursors from the emission from shocked gas. We find that there is considerable scatter in the ratios of precursor intensity to shock intensity and that the precursors account for up to 26% of the total H α emission in SNRs in our sample and 35% of the total [N II ] and [O III ] emission. This is generally similar to what is predicted by steady-state precursor models from MAPPINGS for the shock speeds in the 150–180 km s −1 range, but it is unlikely that all the observed SNRs have shock speeds in this narrow interval. The ratios of precursor to shock emission in H α indicate faster shocks (though selection effects may play a role). The discrepancies between observed and model ratios of precursor to shock emission may be because the precursors are not in steady state, because our fibers select only a portion of the SNRs, so that accidents of geometry can affect the ratio of precursor to shocked emission that we see, or because the plane-parallel MAPPINGS models do not account for geometrical dilution of the radiation field outside of the SNR. Regardless of the modeling issues, these observations point out that precursor emission needs to be taken into account when analyzing spectra obtained on SNRs, especially in galaxies more distant than the local group.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ) has long been used in traditional medicine. Recent studies suggest it supports hair regrowth by enhancing scalp circulation and exerting anti-androgenic effects, with efficacy comparable to minoxidil but a more favourable safety profile. It’s revealed that rosemary may benefit androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, and central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia through improved vascularity, anti-inflammatory activity, and antioxidant effects. Clinical studies show promising outcomes, but responses vary, and large-scale, long-term trials are lacking. This review evaluated the therapeutic potential of rosemary in managing different types of alopecia by focusing on clinical trials, mechanistic studies, and safety reports. Rosemary can be a cost-effective, natural option with potential as an alternative or adjunct to conventional alopecia treatments, but further robust trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the awareness of parents about keratoconus and its association with eye rubbing among children in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Methods: The observational cross-sectional awareness study was conducted among parents in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, between April 2025 and June 2025. A structured and pre-designed questionnaire adapted from a previously validated Arabic version was used to collect demographics, knowledge of keratoconus with eye rubbing and attitudes towards eye rubbing and its potential risks. The awareness level of participants was categorised as poor, fair and good. Results: This study assessed 399 participants, with the majority being females (73.4%), and males were 26.6%. Overall, awareness of keratoconus and its association with eye rubbing was low, demonstrated 79.9% of participants having poor knowledge, 11.5% having fair and only 8.5% having good knowledge. Nearly half of the participants (48.4%) heard about keratoconus, and only 11% correctly identified it as thinning of the cornea. Regarding treatment awareness, just 6.3% identified contact lenses, and 31.1% identified that surgery is the optimal option. In addition, 29.1% of participants correctly knew that eye rubbing causes keratoconus, and it was commonly associated with allergy (30.8%). A significant association was observed between keratoconus awareness and married participants ( P = 0.017), parents of children with atopic conditions ( P = 0.021) and parents of children with underlying eye disease ( P = 0.028). Conclusion: Parental awareness about keratoconus and its association with eye rubbing in children was found low. Future studies are required to validate the findings of the present study.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. As the largest oligotrophic ocean globally, the North Pacific oligotrophic ocean gyre (NPOG) exhibits pronounced variability on seasonal, decadal, and centennial time scales. Notably, changes in the seasonality of the NPOG are thought to have larger effects on marine ecosystems than changes in its annual mean state. However, the interannual variability of NPOG seasonality and its response to climate processes remain unclear. Here, we investigate the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in NPOG area and its linkage with climate variability and change. Our results show that the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulated the seasonal maximum of NPOG area in boreal summer, and thus the amplitude of the seasonal cycle during 1998–2021. This is primarily due to ENSO-induced changes in nutrient transport via equatorial upwelling and thermal stratification, as well as changes in the chlorophyll-to-carbon ratio in phytoplankton cells (photoacclimation). Future projections based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) modelling results and an Elman neural network indicate a significant decrease in the seasonal amplitude of NPOG area by 2100, attributed to the growing seasonal minimum of NPOG area in winter along the anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2. The findings highlight the importance of considering seasonal differences in future research on the interannual variability of oligotrophic gyres and underscore the need for models to distinguish between the effects of climate variability and change.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Illegal logging is one of the most prevalent environmental infractions in the Amazon, led by organized networks that cause substantial ecological and economic impacts. Official control mechanisms, such as Brazil’s Forest Origin Document (DOF), remain vulnerable to the fraudulent manipulation of virtual timber credits and inconsistencies in digital traceability. These deficiencies highlight the need for independent, scientifically based methodologies for timber traceability that can support law enforcement and ensure reliable provenance verification. Here, we tested whether the isotopic composition of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) in wood can trace Amazonian timber origin. We developed basin-wide δ13C and δ15N isoscapes using machine-learning models to predict spatial variability. A total of 571 trees from 47 sites were analyzed for both isotopes. Tree disks or wedges were sampled from the basal trunk, sectioned transversely, and sub-sampled from heartwood to near the sapwood boundary to obtain whole-tree isotopic composition. The δ13C and, more strongly, the δ15N values exhibited substantial within-site heterogeneity, indicating individual-level physiological controls, interspecific differences, and/or small-scale environmental variation influencing isotope fractionation. Despite these sources of noise, isotopic values showed independent and predictable spatial patterns across the basin (R2=0.67 for δ15N and R2=0.60 for δ13C). Nitrogen isotopes were primarily controlled by edaphic factors, while carbon isotopes revealed a broad longitudinal gradient linked to climate. Together, these isotopic markers provide complementary information for basin-scale timber provenancing and form a robust, high-resolution framework for Amazon-wide traceability.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Dansgaard–Oeschger (D–O) warming events are comparable in magnitude and rate to the anticipated 21st century warming. As such, they provide a good target for evaluation of the ability of state-of-the-art climate models to simulate rapid climate changes. Despite the wealth of qualitative information about climate changes during the D–O events, there has been no attempt to date to make quantitative reconstructions globally. Here we use frequency-corrected Tolerance-weighted Weighted Averaging Partial Least Squares regression (fxTWA-PLS) to reconstruct mean temperature of the coldest month, mean temperature of the warmest month, and a plant-available moisture index across multiple D–O events between 50 and 30 ka based on available pollen records across the globe. The reconstruction of plant-available moisture is corrected for the impact of changing atmospheric CO2 concentrations on plant water use efficiency. These reconstructions show that the largest warming occurred in northern extratropics, especially Eurasia, while western North America and the southern extratropics were characterised by cooling. The change in winter temperature was significantly larger than the change in summer temperature in the northern extratropics and the tropics, indicating that the D–O warming events were characterised by reduced seasonality, but there was no significant difference between the summer and winter temperature changes in the southern extratropics. The antiphasing between northern and southern extratropical changes, and the west-east pattern of cooling and warming in North America were generally consistent across the eight D–O events examined, although coherency is greatest during the strongest events. There was no globally consistent pattern between changes in moisture and changes in temperature. These reconstructions can be used to evaluate the spatial patterns of changes in temperature and moisture in the transient simulations of the D–O events planned as part of the Palaeoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project.",

Argo profiles of temperature/salinity (T/S) at specific times and locations from January 2003 through December 2023 are mapped into monthly maps of steric sea level (SSL), thermosteric sea level (TSL), and Ocean Heat Content (OHC) anomalies at long wavelengths (&gt;1500 km) down to depths of 2000 m. The mapping uses a monthly satellite reference computed from the difference between satellite altimetry and gravimetry, so that in periods where there is not sufficient global Argo coverage (generally before 2007), the satellite estimate is used instead of a mean monthly climatology or zero, as other analysis centers use. Longwave mapping is done to reduce large errors introduced by poor sampling of mesoscale eddies by the Argo floats. We demonstrate that on global- and basin-scales, the longwave mapping does not substantially affect calculations of mean SSL, TSL, or OHC changes. Monthly standard error maps from the mapping are also provided. These maps are intended for users interested in understanding global- and basin-scale sea level budgets, as well as combining with deep ocean measurements to study ocean heat uptake.

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important component of the global carbon cycle and a vital indicator of ecosystem health, playing key roles in agricultural productivity and climate change mitigation. To trace the spatiotemporal dynamics of SOC in China, a high-resolution (1 km) Soil Organic Carbon Density (SOCD) dataset for the 0–20 and 0–100 cm depths spanning the period from 1985 to 2020 is produced in this study. By integrating Landsat archives, topographic and meteorological data, and 11 743 soil profile measurements, we produced the SOCD dataset from 1985–2020 in China using the Random Forest ensemble learning approach. Specially, a climate zoning strategy was developed to account for the significant environmental heterogeneity across China. The validation of our SOCD estimated results with 0–20 cm depth with independent testing samples showed strong agreement with R2=0.63 and RMSE=2.03 (kg C m−2) for 0–20 cm SOCD estimation and R2=0.62 and RMSE=6.16 (kg C m−2) for 0–100 cm. Moreover, our SOCD estimated results with 0–20 cm depth are aligned well with independent samples (R2=0.76, RMSE=1.75 kg C m−2) and Xu's dataset (R2=0.68, RMSE=1.70 kg C m−2). Furthermore, the validation of our SOCD estimated results with 0–100 cm depth with independent measurements from Dong et al. (2024a) showed strong agreement (R2=0.50, RMSE=4.93 kg C m−2). Furthermore, our SOCD product exhibits high consistency with existing global datasets (HWSD, SoilGrids250 m, and GSOCmap), showing the best fit with SoilGrids250 m (R2=0.74, RMSE=1.03 kg C m−2). Comparisons of model predictions to independent datasets from the 1980s, 2000s, and 2010s in China reveal substantial connections and demonstrate strong performance over time. The estimated SOCD products, along with the compiled raw soil profile observations for both 0–20 and 0–100 cm depths, are openly available via Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27290310.v2) (Dong et al., 2024b).",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. In April 2020, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center introduced a Level 2 provisional Aquatic Reflectance (AR) product for the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), marking the initial phase in developing a standardized global product for Landsat-derived surface water measurements. The goal of USGS EROS aquatic product research and development is to prepare for an operational processing architecture for Landsat Collection 3 in the late 2020s that will enable use of quality-controlled data for emerging Landsat aquatic science applications. To achieve this, we released a subset of the Landsat 8/9 provisional AR products (Crawford et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5066/P14MBBRM) and examined its general performance through the Science Algorithms to Operations (SATO) framework alongside quantitative assessment using community made inland water data records (GLObal Reflectance community dataset for Imaging and optical sensing of Aquatic environments, GLORIA) and radiometric coastal validation platforms (NASA's Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network, AERONET-OC). Variability within the validation datasets indicate that the performance of the Landsat 8/9 provisional AR retrieval is highly context-dependent; errors are minimal in optically simple waters (e.g., clear to moderately turbid coastal waters) but increase considerably in optically complex waters where factors such as elevated levels of turbidity, chlorophyll (Chl a) concentrations, or colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) dominate the water column. Additionally, this paper examines key algorithmic considerations for atmospheric correction, highlighting factors that influence accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency necessary for collection processing in the operational Landsat Product Generation System (LPGS). This paper is intended to communicate with aquatic scientists, satellite oceanographers, and the broader Earth observation community on the origins, requirements, challenges, successes, and future objectives for operationalizing global AR data products for Landsat satellite missions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Conceptual hydrological models, traditionally relying on simplified representations of physical processes governed by conservation laws remain widely used in operational hydrology due to their explainability and practical applicability. However, these process-based models inherently face structural uncertainties and a lack of scale-relevant theories – challenges that emerging artificial intelligence (AI) techniques may help address. In parallel, high-resolution models are crucial for predicting extreme events characterized by strong variability and short duration, making spatially distributed hybrid modeling critical in the current context. We introduce a hybrid physics–AI framework that embeds neural networks (NNs) seamlessly into a spatialized, regionalizable, and fully differentiable process-based model via universal differential equations (UDEs). The model integrates a state-dependent NN to refine internal water fluxes and an implicit resolution of the UDE system, followed by kinematic wave routing on a flow direction grid. Spatially distributed parameters are inferred through regionalization mappings including convolutional NNs, and adjoint-based gradients enable end-to-end training of the hybrid system. We implement this framework into the latest release of the smash platform, significantly extending its capabilities to comprehensively evaluate hybrid models at kilometric spatial and hourly temporal resolutions. The results show that hybrid approaches demonstrate consistently strong and stable performance in calibration and various validation scenarios. Additionally, the UDE structure exhibits a hybridization effect that modifies state dynamics and runoff flow, achieving more accurate streamflow simulations for flood modeling.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Accurately characterizing groundwater level dynamics in seasonal frozen soil regions is of great significance for water resource management and ecosystem protection. To this end, this study proposes a new interpretable deep learning method to reveal the underlying causes of groundwater level dynamics on the basis of groundwater level simulation. Using the Songnen Plain in China as the study area and daily data from 138 monitoring wells, groundwater levels are simulated with an Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, and the Expected Gradients (EG) method is employed to quantitatively identify the dominant factors and mechanisms of different groundwater level variation types.The results show that the LSTM model performs well on the test set, with the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) exceeding 0.7 at 81.88 % of the monitoring sites, effectively capturing the temporal dynamics of groundwater levels. At the annual scale, three typical groundwater level variation types are identified: precipitation infiltration–evaporation type (29.0 %), precipitation infiltration–runoff type (18.1 %), and extraction type (52.9 %). Corresponding to the seasonal frozen-thaw period, groundwater level dynamics are classified into “V”-shaped (38.4 %), continuous decline (23.2 %), and continuous rise (38.4 %) types. Quantitative analysis using the EG method indicates that air temperature, precipitation, and snow thickness are the primary controlling factors of the “V”-shaped dynamics, reflecting the regulatory role of the frozen-thaw process on groundwater levels.When the initial groundwater level depth at the beginning of the freezing period is shallower than the sum of the frozen-thaw influence depth and the capillary rise height, a hydraulic connection is established between soil water and groundwater, resulting in typical “V”-shaped fluctuations. Conversely, when the depth exceeds this critical threshold, the frozen-thaw process cannot significantly influence the aquifer, and groundwater dynamics are mainly manifested as continuous rise or continuous decline, driven respectively by groundwater extraction and water level recovery following precipitation recharge. This study establishes an integrated framework of “simulation–classification–interpretation,” which not only improves the accuracy of groundwater level dynamic simulation and prediction but also provides new methods and perspectives for revealing the underlying mechanisms. The findings offer theoretical support and technical basis for regional groundwater resource management in cold regions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Hydrological data sets have vast potential for water resource management applications; however, they are subject to uncertainties. In this paper, we develop and apply a monthly probabilistic water balance data fusion approach for automatic bias correction and noise filtering of multi-scale hydrological data. The approach first calibrates the independent data sets by linking them through the water balance, resulting in hydrologically consistent estimates of precipitation (P), evaporation (E), storage (S), irrigation canal water imports (C), and river discharge (Q) that jointly close the basin-scale water balance. Next, the basin-scale results are downscaled to the pixel-scale, to generate calibrated ensembles of gridded Precipitation (P) and Evaporation (E) that reflect the basin-wide water balance closure constraints. An application to the irrigated Hindon River basin in India illustrates that the approach generates physically reasonable estimates of all basin-scale variables, with average standard errors decreasing in the following order: 21 mm month−1 for storage, 10 mm month−1 for evaporation, 7 mm month−1 for precipitation, 4 mm month−1 for irrigation canal water imports, and 2 mm month−1 for river discharge. Results show that updating the original independent data with water balance constraint information reduces uncertainties by inducing cross-correlations between all independent variables linked through the water balance. In addition, the introduced approach yields (i) hydrologically consistent gridded P and E estimates that fuse information from prior (original) data across different land use elements and (ii) statistically consistent random errors that reflect the model's confidence about P and E estimates at each grid cell. The analysis also shows a long-term decreasing trend in groundwater, which is better captured by the more severe decline from GRACE JPL mascon than GRACE Spherical Harmonic data. This finding points towards the possible sustainability issues for irrigation in the basin and requires further validation using piezometer groundwater-level measurements. Future opportunities exist to further constrain the generated water balance variables and their associated errors within process-based models and with additional data.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Introduction: Biofilm formation is one of the key elements making orthopaedic device-related infections (ODRIs) difficult to eradicate. Aminoglycosides such as gentamicin are frequently applied via local carriers, and systemic rifampin is added for its anti-biofilm activity. However, robust in vitro evidence of their ability to eradicate mature biofilm is limited. This study assessed whether gentamicin, alone or in combination with rifampin, can eradicate established Staphylococcus aureus biofilm in vitro. Methods: A clinical methicillin-susceptible S. aureus isolate was grown as a 5 d old biofilm on a peg lid microtiter plate. Three exposure regimens were tested: (i) continuous exposure to gentamicin (15–2000 mg L−1) for 28 d, (ii) intermittent 2 h exposures twice daily (at 15, 250 and 2000 mg L−1) for 28 d to reflect systemic twice-daily dosing and (iii) a 14 d burst release starting at 2000 mg L−1 with stepwise decline to model release from local carriers. Rifampin was either absent or added at 3.3 mg L−1, approximating peri-implant concentrations from preclinical pharmacokinetic studies. Biofilm viability was quantified as colony-forming units (CFUs) from sonicated pegs, and selected surviving isolates underwent susceptibility testing. Results: Across all regimens, concentration- and time-dependent decreases in CFU counts were observed, but no regimen resulted in bacterial counts falling below the lower limit of detection (LLOD). The addition of rifampin did not result in the sustained enhancement of biofilm killing, and, in some regimens, resulted in higher CFU counts. Isolates recovered from culture-positive pegs remained largely susceptible to gentamicin, whereas rifampin resistance arose sporadically. Conclusion: High-dose gentamicin exposures failed to eradicate 5 d old S. aureus biofilm in vitro, whatever the administration regimen. Rifampin co-administration did not alter the final outcome of biofilm persistence, despite its well-recognised anti-biofilm activity. These findings challenge the reliance on aminoglycoside-loaded carriers as curative strategies for ODRIs and suggest that persistent viability may reflect antibiotic tolerance that may not be overcome by antibiotics alone.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. The large seasonal increases in marine photosynthetic organisms – i.e., phytoplankton blooms – are a ubiquitous oceanic phenomenon that contributes to the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and supports the growth of larger marine organisms. The underlying mechanisms controlling the intensity and timing of these blooms have been proposed to be dominated by vertical transport and mixing processes that are enhanced at fine-scale frontal and filamental circulations, commonly known as submesoscale currents. Here we show that the winter blooms characteristic of the ultra-oligotrophic waters of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, which manifest as a seasonal increase in satellite-derived levels of surface chlorophyll, are intensified by enhanced horizontal stirring induced by the submesoscale currents. Using ocean color remote sensing data and high-resolution numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the intensification of submesoscale currents in winter efficiently connect the coastal waters and the ultra-oligotrophic open-sea waters, thereby enriching the latter with chlorophyll-rich waters. A climatological chlorophyll time series comparison between two different regions equidistant to the Nile River Delta indicates that this submesoscale horizontal stirring mechanism accounts for the ∼ 24.8 % larger wintertime increase in surface chlorophyll observed downstream of the Nile Delta. These results shed new light on the processes governing phytoplankton bloom intensity and emphasize the important role of submesoscale horizontal stirring in modulating the marine ecosystem.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. The Eastern Mediterranean is experiencing severe warming and drying, driven by global warming, making seasonal precipitation prediction in the region imperative. Given that the Mediterranean Sea is the primary source of regional moisture and synoptic variability, here we explore the observed relation of Mediterranean Sea variability to Levant land precipitation during winter – the dominant wet season. Using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) objective analysis, we identify three dominant modes of sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean heat uptake variability in the Mediterranean Sea. Of these, two modes characterized by east-west variations are found to be statistically related to winter land precipitation in the Levant. Based on these relations, we define an Aegean Sea heat uptake anomaly index (AQA), which is strongly correlated with Levant winter precipitation. Specifically, AQA values during August are found to predict Levant land precipitation in the following winter (December–February, R=-0.60). Wetter winters over the Levant following negative August AQA values are associated with more persistent eastward-propagating Mediterranean storms, driven by enhanced baroclinicity and a stronger subtropical jet. The results present AQA as a useful seasonal predictor of Levant winter precipitation and indicate that representations of processes affecting Mediterranean cyclones, the subtropical jet, and ocean-atmosphere heat exchange are key to seasonal forecasting skill in the Levant.",

    "Abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a prevalent secondary complication of diabetes mellitus, characterised by nerve fibre degeneration, neurosensory deficits, and chronic neuropathic pain, all of which have significant clinical impact by increasing disability, reducing quality of life, and complicating diabetes management. While oxidative stress and neuroinflammation are established contributors to DPN pathogenesis, the specific involvement of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway in DPN remains incompletely defined. Recent findings indicate cell-type-specific dysregulation of mTOR signalling in diabetic peripheral nerves, with direct implications for targeted clinical interventions. This review outlines the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and therapeutic approaches for DPN, with a particular emphasis on the differential regulation of mTOR signalling in sensory neurons and Schwann cells. A greater understanding of these molecular mechanisms could improve diagnosis and refine treatment plans for DPN patients in clinical settings. Literature published from 1990 to 2025 was systematically reviewed to enhance understanding of the mTOR pathway’s contributions to DPN pathogenesis. This review clarifies that mTOR operates differently in sensory neurons and Schwann cells during persistent hyperglycaemia in DPN. Overactive mTOR in sensory neurons increases neuropathic pain by enhancing neuron excitability, altering ion channels, and disrupting synapses. In vitro studies indicate reduced mTOR activity in Schwann cells, likely impairing repair processes such as dedifferentiation, survival, myelin production, and nerve support. Human tissue studies yield mixed results, leaving the consistency of these changes across patients unresolved. Consequently, further research is essential to clarify the precise and consistent impact of mTOR alterations in specific cell types.",

    "Abstract": "Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles play a major role in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. This condition leads to cognitive impairment and cell death. It is challenging to transport therapeutic medications over the blood-brain barrier, which is which limits the availability of effective treatments for this disease. Nanoliposomes are amphiphilic bilayer structure that can carry medicinal chemicals across the blood-brain barrier. Because of this, they are often used to deliver drugs. The objective of this study is to examine how nanoliposomes reduce the detrimental consequences of Alzheimer's disease by focusing on Aβ oligomers, diminishing neuroinflammation, and maintaining neuronal integrity. Adding ligands that target Aβ to nanoliposomes makes the treatment work better and have fewer side effects. Sphingolipids, gangliosides, curcumin, and monoclonal antibodies are all examples of ligands. Animal models of Alzheimer's disease have also shown that nanoliposomes can help with memory and congnitive functions. There have been big steps forward in using biological systems, but there are still problems with biocompatibility, scalability, and getting regulatory approval. Nonetheless, considerable data from preclinical studies indicates that nanoliposomes may serve as a crucial tool in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. This technique would provide a new and personalized approach to treating this terrible disease.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates focus-induced word-order variation in two groups of informants from Bulgaria: bilingual speakers of Bulgarian (BG) and the critically endangered minority language Judeo-Spanish (BJS), and monolingual speakers of BG. Based on semi-spontaneous data collected as part of an elicited production task, it is shown that the two languages largely pattern together in preferring the signalling of focus in situ via prosodic means, although syntactic strategies such as p-movement, focus fronting, and dislocations are used to a minor extent. Clefting only occurs in the BJS data. Furthermore, the syntax of BJS shows linear orderings of constituents that are ungrammatical in Mainstream Spanish and strongly point to cross-linguistic influence from BG. The study thus presents further evidence for the instability of interface phenomena such as the realization of information structure in language contact and hence supports the Interface Hypothesis (Sorace 2011, Chamorro &amp; Sorace 2019).",

    "Abstract": "This paper addresses changes in the pronominal grammar of contemporary French. The use of the generic masculine in a grammar built on the masculine/feminine distinction has been criticized for rendering female and non-binary genders invisible. Speakers have created new linguistic practices to promote linguistic equality: inclusive language (écriture inclusive) and gender-neutral language (écriture neutre). This study focuses on neo-pronouns that convey inclusive and gender-neutral reference. The empirical data collected on X reflect linguistic responses to the ongoing evolution of gender representation in society. Their analysis leads to a semantic model of reference that captures the enriched pronominal grammar of gender and agreement in emerging varieties of French.",

    "Abstract": "This article is centered on a root-clause usage of Catalan que. It focuses on the meaning the particle contributes to assertions and polar questions. In particular, it proposes that que serves to attribute a commitment to a proposition to the addressee. The article adopts a recent idea from speech act theory that views commitments as social obligations speakers take up when performing speech acts. While most previous work on assertions focuses on speaker’s commitments, the main contribution of que is an (attributed) addressee’s commitment. The effect of que on the dynamics of the conversation are analyzed adopting Malamud and Stephenson’s dynamic framework and a first formal analysis of the expressive meaning of que is developed by drawing from Krifka (2023a) and Gutzmann (2015).",

    "Abstract": "This paper focuses on the amount of functional structure and on the Voice properties of complement clauses in tough-constructions, on the basis of previously unexplored variation patterns in Italo-Romance. Cross-dialectal data from various regions of Italy (north, south, extreme south, and islands) show that two main syntactic types of tough-constructions are attested, interacting with the complementation strategies available in each variety. In Type 1, the embedded clause is a VoiceP with an infinitive; in Type 2, the embedded clause is a full TP or a CP and its verb (non-finite or finite) has either passive morphology or a resumptive object clitic. In light of this distribution, I propose that heavily reduced clauses have a passive-like argument realisation pattern (as in Type 1), in contrast with larger clauses (as in Type 2) which behave in a standard way despite being more heterogeneous. This claim supports an extension of current accounts of clausal complementation in Italo-Romance to one more pattern.",

    "Abstract": "Even though there were already calls around the turn of the millennium for the heritage languages of learners to be included in foreign-language teaching (e.g., Gogolin 1994, Hu 2003), the acquisition of phonology in the context of migration-induced multilingualism is still an emerging area of research in both linguistics and language pedagogy. Based on recent studies on the acquisition of L3 French and Spanish phonology by heritage bilinguals (e.g., Gabriel et al. 2014/2018/2022, Grünke &amp; Gabriel 2022), it is posited that the acquisition of a foreign language’s sound system is enhanced by metalinguistic and phonological awareness. Furthermore, such awareness can be fostered by imparting declarative knowledge regarding the similarities and differences between the languages of the learners’ linguistic background and the foreign languages they learn. Whether interventions can foster facilitative transfer from a heritage language onto the target language seems to be contingent upon three factors: (i) the maintenance of the relevant feature in the learner’s heritage language, (ii) the degree of activation of the learner’s heritage language during the learning process, and (iii) the perceptual salience of the feature at issue. In the light of insights from phonetic learning, we argue that intensive pronunciation training over a longer period is required to support and consolidate the positive, sometimes short-term effects found in the studies.",

    "Abstract": "Spanish demonstratives may appear before the noun (este libro ‘this book’) or after the noun (el libro este ‘the book this’). Despite their relevance for comparative syntax (Giusti 1997, 2015, Brugè 1996, 2002), little work has been done on their meaning. Based on elicitation data, this paper proposes the first formal semantic treatment of the two Spanish constructions, with a particular focus on the lesser studied postnominal demonstrative. The main proposal is that the postnominal is an indexed adjective, i.e. an adjective carrying a “silent pronoun”. Additionally, it is argued that the postnominal is a weak demonstrative, unlike its prenominal counterpart, which explains its reduced distribution in deixis. These two points capture previously unexplained differences between the two constructions, as well as another (better understood) alternation in Spanish, namely pre- and postnominal possessives. The paper contributes to the cross-linguistic study of demonstratives by examining an atypical adjectival demonstrative from a semantic lens.",

The study presents novel data from EP, a language less studied in this context, and contributes to the Syntax/Discourse interface approach. The authors investigate various aspects of insubordination, including contexts of use, pragmatic values, and types of linguistic expressions associated with these structures. The research reveals that EP insubordinate que-clauses demonstrate less independence than their PS counterparts, maintaining a strong connection with the standard embedding que complementizer. Their discursive value is primarily inferred from situational or pragmatic contexts, often relying on anchors such as juxtaposed preceding sentences or initial interjections. The findings of this work contribute to challenge the strict distinction between syntactic and discourse relations in natural language.",

    "Abstract": "Tendons and ligaments are crucial connective tissues linking bones and muscles, yet achieving full functional recovery after injury remains challenging. We investigated the characteristics of tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs) by focusing on the declining tendon repair capacity with growth. Using single-cell RNA sequencing on Achilles tendon cells from 2- and 6-week-old mice, we identified Cd55 and Cd248 as novel surface antigen markers for TSPCs. Combining single-cell RNA sequencing with single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing analyses revealed that Cd55- and Cd248 -positive fractions in tendon tissue represent TSPCs, as confirmed by their expression of established TSPC markers, with this population decreasing at 6 weeks. We also identified candidate upstream transcription factors regulating these fractions. Functional analyses of isolated CD55/CD248-positive cells demonstrated high clonogenic potential and tendon differentiation capacity, forming functional tendon-like tissue in vitro. This study establishes CD55 and CD248 as novel TSPC surface antigens, potentially advancing tendon regenerative medicine and contributing to the development of new treatment strategies for tendon and ligament injuries.",

    "Abstract": "With the rapid growth of e-commerce, consumer demand for personalized packaging solutions has grown significantly. To address this issue, this article constructs an intelligent recommendation model that combines user behavior data and sentiment analysis techniques. Firstly, a user behavior preference model is established by collecting potential preferences and behavioral characteristics of users, in order to explore their network behavior characteristics. Next, the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) word vector is used to represent the comment text, and a bidirectional recurrent neural network is used to quantify the emotional information in the comment. Based on the emotional rating, the rating matrix is updated to map the shallow features of users and resources. Subsequently, by combining convolutional neural networks and self attention mechanisms, deep features of users and resources are extracted from comment texts, and shallow and deep features are fused through multi-layer neural networks to model the nonlinear interaction between users and resources and predict the rating values of recommended resources. In addition, this article proposes a hierarchical attention enhanced recommendation model incorporating User behavior and sentiment analysis (HAER-UBSA), which obtains feature information from comment texts through attention mechanisms and models comment level embedded representations of users and items. The experimental results show that compared with other baseline models, the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) indicators of our model have improved by 10.34% and 10.00%, respectively.",

    "Abstract": "Early and accurate detection of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), particularly at the very mild and mild cognitive impairment stages, remains a significant clinical challenge due to subtle anatomical changes and overlapping imaging features between classes. This study evaluates the effectiveness of synthetic MRI image augmentation using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) to improve the classification performance of deep learning models for early-stage AD detection. The dataset consists of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans categorized into “No Dementia,” “Very Mild Dementia,” “Mild Dementia,” and “Moderate Dementia” classes, sourced from a publicly available repository. A baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was initially trained on traditionally augmented images and evaluated on a validation set. To address class imbalance and improve sensitivity for the “Very Mild Dementia” class, a DCGAN was trained on this subset to generate synthetic MRI images. Generator models were checkpointed based on their Frechet Inception Distance (FID) scores, and 500 synthetic images from each selected generator were incorporated into the training set. Comparative analysis revealed that while the baseline CNN achieved a validation accuracy of 98% and a precision of 0.97 for the “Very Mild Dementia” class, the augmented model utilizing synthetic images from the Epoch 72 generator improved performance to 99% accuracy with a macro F1-score of 1.00. Statistical significance was confirmed via McNemar’s test ( p &lt; 0.05), highlighting the potential of GAN-based augmentation for enhancing early AD classification. These findings underscore the importance of strategic checkpoint selection in GAN-based data augmentation to ensure clinically meaningful performance improvements.",

    "Abstract": "Nocturnal non-speech sounds encapsulate critical physiological and behavioral information, making them a valuable modality for non-invasive assessment of sleep quality. Despite this potential, existing approaches predominantly rely on single-view spectral features or shallow learning architectures, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse acoustic patterns. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid deep learning architecture tailored for the classification of seven distinct nocturnal sound categories. The system employs a tri-branch design that independently processes Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), Mel-spectrogram, and constant-Q transform (CQT)-spectrogram representations. Each branch passes through a dedicated pipeline comprising convolutional neural networks (CNN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) layers, and attention-equipped vision transformers (ViT). This configuration facilitates hierarchical learning of local, temporal, and global contextual features. The softmax outputs of each branch are fused using a stacking ensemble strategy, with an XGBoost-based meta-classifier performing the final decision integration. A complementary weighted ensemble is also implemented for comparative evaluation. Experimental results on a publicly available seven-class non-speech sound dataset demonstrate the proposed model’s outstanding performance, achieving 99.71% accuracy under 10-fold cross-validation, along with consistently high precision, recall, and F1-scores across all classes. Comparative benchmarks show substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art models, including CNNs, long short-term memory (LSTM) variants, classical machine learning approaches, and metaheuristic-based ensembles. Supporting analyses such as confidence score distributions and dimensionality reduction visualizations (principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)) further validate the model’s robustness and discriminative power. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating multi-spectral representations, deep hierarchical modeling, and ensemble strategies for high-fidelity nocturnal non-speech sound classification.",

    "Abstract": "Brain tumors often require treatment and multiple biopsies. They are the third most common cancer among young adults in both incidence and mortality. The expression of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene plays an important role in predicting tumor behavior. It affects how patients respond to chemotherapy and may reduce the need for invasive procedures. Machine learning can help make accurate medical predictions, but it requires large and diverse patient datasets. These datasets are difficult to access due to privacy and legal restrictions. This article proposes a Federated Learning (FL) framework to address these challenges. FL allows different institutions to train a shared model without exchanging raw data. A hybrid deep learning model combining recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is developed to analyze magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from the BraTS 2021 dataset. The model aims to detect glioblastoma and predict MGMT gene expression. Two swarm intelligence algorithms, the Bayesian Search Optimization Algorithm and the Sparrow Search Optimization Algorithm, are used to optimize the model’s hyperparameters. The FL system was tested across ten universities. It performed similarly to models trained on centralized data. The proposed model, BrainGeneDeepNet, achieved high performance: 0.9758 accuracy, 0.0769 loss, 0.9980 AUC, 0.9770 recall, and 0.9782 precision. These results show that federated learning is a secure and effective approach for medical imaging and biomarker prediction.",

    "Abstract": "Background With the widespread adoption of electronic medical records, massive prescription data can be digitized and systematically stored. This provides a solid foundation for intelligent traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) diagnosis systems. TCM syndrome classification is the core of syndrome differentiation and treatment. Developing an effective classification framework remains a major challenge for intelligent diagnosis systems. Recent progress in natural language processing has introduced new approaches and tools for semantic understanding and knowledge extraction from prescription texts. However, traditional machine learning methods rely on hand-crafted features and struggle to process high-dimensional, sparse, and intricate TCM prescription texts. The single text-based model can capture semantic features but ignore the structural connections in prescription data. The single graph-based model emphasizes structural associations but fails to incorporate rich contextual semantics. Methods To address the challenges, we propose a new dual-channel TCM syndrome classification model (DC-TSCM) in healthcare applications. The text channel extracts deep representations from clinical description and physique detection texts. We developed a TCM differentiation-guided attention fusion module to dynamically learn the optimal weighting between prescription texts. The graph channel constructs a unique TCM differentiation heterogeneous graph and uses hybrid graph neural networks to model the complex semantic associations among clinical entities. Additionally, we extracted 8,280 prescriptions from real electronic medical records, covering 24 different syndrome types. The prescription data were standardized according to clinical diagnostic terminology and divided into training, validation, and test sets in an 8:1:1 ratio. Results Experiments were conducted on a structured multi-label syndrome differentiation dataset. The results indicate that the model achieves superior performance and strong generalization ability in multi-class syndrome classification. Its interpretability is further validated through visualization analysis, including the co-occurrence relationship heat map, confusion matrix, and receiver operating characteristic curve. The dual-channel model achieved an accuracy of 0.8919, precision of 0.9012, recall of 0.8947, and F1-score of 0.8930. Conclusion Overall, DC-TSCM bridges semantic understanding with structural reasoning and incorporates the principles of TCM differentiation. It significantly improves the accuracy of syndrome differentiation and suggests potential applicability beyond TCM, which could be explored in future work. It also provides a robust and interpretable framework for intelligent auxiliary diagnosis systems and lays a foundation for the integration of clinical knowledge with advanced deep learning methodologies.",

    "Abstract": "Enzymes, as key biocatalysts, are essential for advancing sustainable green technologies across diverse industrial sectors. The discovery of novel enzymes is essential for expanding their applications. In this study, we identified new lipases using an integrated screening strategy. This approach combines both structural and sequence-based methods on a large-scale metagenomic database. This strategy enabled the identification of new lipases with low sequence identity to known reference proteins. Our approach, therefore, circumvents the limitations of traditional sequence-only methods, which often fail to identify functionally similar enzymes with low sequence similarity. We first used Foldseek, a state-of-the-art structural homology search tool, to rapidly screen the database for proteins with structures similar to widely used lipases. This was followed by a rigorous sequence similarity filtering against public protein databases, yielding 711 putative novel lipases. We selected and experimentally validated three candidates, confirming their lipase activity. Further biochemical characterization revealed their notable properties including thermostability with optimal activity at 50–55 °C, and distinct alkaline activity profiles, maximal at pH of 8.0–9.0. Their unique properties, including high activity at elevated temperatures and alkaline pH, suggest potential for applications in detergent formulations, bioremediation, and industrial biocatalysis. Beyond identifying these promising enzymes, this study demonstrates the power of a combined structural and sequence-based approach for finding novel biocatalysts. This methodological innovation has broad implications for future enzyme discovery from metagenomic resources.",

    "Abstract": "Background Studies have shown that vertical jump biomechanics or patterns may be related to physical fitness. This study investigated the relationship between physical fitness and drop vertical jump (DVJ) biomechanics in male college basketball players. Methods Health-related physical fitness was measured by 20s sit-up, core endurance and flexibility test; whilst athletic-related physical fitness by Y-balance test and dominant extremity single-leg hop distance test. Kinetics and kinematics during DVJ were evaluated by VICON. Results Five-level side bridge correlated negatively with angle displacement of hip adduction ( p = 0.014) and positively with moment of knee flexion ( p = 0.033); 8-level abdominal bridge correlated positively with moment of knee flexion ( p = 0.01); ankle dorsiflexion range of motion correlated negatively with mediolateral ground reaction force ( p = 0.025), angle displacement of knee flexion ( p = 0.004), moment of ankle plantarflexion ( p = 0.009), and positively with angle displacement of ankle plantarflexion ( p = 0.015); ankle plantarflexion ROM correlated negatively with angle of knee flexion ( p = 0.012); trunk flexion ROM correlated negatively with moment of ankle plantarflexion ( p = 0.014). Conclusion Health-related physical fitness could be the alternatives for DVJ biomechanics assessment.",

    "Abstract": "Background Health systems are struggling to deliver timely preventive care, particularly for marginalized populations, necessitating integration across health, education, and social services. For Indigenous youth in rural communities, fragmented services, isolation, and limited culturally safe options worsen mental health disparities. Interactive technologies, particularly human-centered artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled digital health platforms grounded in human-computer interaction (HCI), can enable remote interaction with citizens and decision-makers. This study investigated a serendipitous natural experiment to assess varying levels of platform nudging on Indigenous youth compliance in a longitudinal intervention. Method This study emerged from the final year of a 5-year initiative embedding a culturally appropriate digital health intervention into school curricula in rural Indigenous communities. While the broader aim was to assess long-term mental health outcomes, an unexpected system disruption assessment of digital nudging on compliance. The platform featured two interfaces: a citizen-facing mobile app for ecological assessments and nudges, and a scientist dashboard for monitoring engagement and triggering nudges. Youth received three nudges: (1) daily system-triggered reminders to complete assessments, (2) weekly non-personalized messages ( e.g ., land-based activity reminders), and (3) weekly personalized “Best Picture” messages showcasing youth-submitted images. The disruption created four phases: Phase 1 included all nudges; Phase 2 removed non-personalized and personalized nudges; Phase 3 reintroduced them; Phase 4 removed only personalized nudges. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post hoc tests in R 4.4.2. Results Compliance, measured by completed mobile ecological prospective assessments (mEPAs), varied significantly across most phases. Comprehensive nudging (Phase 1) yielded the highest completion rates and fastest response times, which declined following the removal of personalized scientist-triggered nudges. Loss of personalized scientist-triggered nudges had the most substantial impact on compliance. Conclusions Consistent system-triggered reminders and personalized “Best Picture” nudges were most effective in sustaining compliance. Findings highlight the importance of integrating personalized, two-way communication features into digital health platforms to strengthen engagement in rural Indigenous communities. By enabling real-time interaction between youth and scientists, the platform supported integration across health, education, and research sectors. Its human-controlled backend and customizable citizen-facing interface reflect principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing trust and autonomy. This approach offers a scalable model for ethical, effective digital interventions that balance technological precision and participant agency.",

    "Abstract": "Mental health and physical health are closely linked, and people diagnosed with mental health conditions need to be offered regular physical health assessments. Cardiovascular health is an important consideration when prescribing antidepressants, as side effects of these medicines can include serious cardiovascular events. Therefore, mental health nurses working at an advanced level of practice need to be able to assess service users' physical health as well as their mental health. Conducting a physical health assessment and checking cardiac health is crucial to guide decision-making when prescribing antidepressants. This article uses a case study to discuss the role of advanced practitioners in assessing the physical health of mental health service users, underlining the importance of physical health competence in advanced level mental health nursing practice.",
