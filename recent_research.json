    "Abstract": "Importance The ongoing consequences of settler colonialism produce adverse structural drivers, particularly nutrition insecurity, that contribute to cardiovascular health disparities among Indigenous populations. There is increased focus in Native communities to reclaim traditional precontact foods to improve health. Therefore, a locally sourced, Indigenous, medically tailored meal delivery program—MUTTON-HF (Medically Utilized Tailored Traditional Foods to Optimize Nutrition in Heart Failure)—was developed to improve health outcomes. Objective To determine implementation outcomes, including feasibility and acceptability, as well as to explore preintervention vs postintervention health measures of a medically tailored meal program incorporating traditional foods and recipes for patients with heart failure in rural Navajo Nation. Design, Setting, and Participants The single-arm pilot nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted from October 7, 2024, to February 3, 2025, to evaluate implementation and health outcomes of the MUTTON-HF program. Participants included adults (≥18 years) with a diagnosis of heart failure who were receiving care at one of 2 Indian Health Service sites in rural Navajo Nation. Intervention Patients received 14 culturally and medically tailored meals weekly (2 meals daily) for 4 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were intervention feasibility and acceptability, assessed with surveys, qualitative interviews, and programmatic data at 30 days. Intervention feasibility was determined by evaluating the number and percentage of meal boxes successfully received by each patient. Acceptability was assessed using the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) (score range, 4-20), patient program ratings (range, 1-10), and the Net Promoter Score. Secondary outcomes, which were assessed via surveys and medical record review, included intervention adoption and fidelity, feasibility for community partners (including farmers and ranchers, using the Feasibility of Intervention Measure [score range, 4-20]), and preintervention vs postintervention health measures (eg, clinical biomarkers, food insecurity [based on the US Department of Agriculture 6-item Short-Form Food Security Survey Module], 12-item Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire [KCCQ] scores, and Cultural Connectedness Scale [CCS] scores). Results This study enrolled 20 American Indian patients (mean [SD] age, 58.2 [11.7] years; 13 were male [65.0%]) residing in communities exceeding a 136-km radius in Arizona and New Mexico. Patients had a mean (SD) left ventricular ejection fraction of 40.0% (16.0%). Of the 80 weekly meal boxes, 72 (90.0%) were successfully received by patients. The mean (SD) AIM score was 16.9 (3.1), the mean (SD) patient program rating was 8.6 (1.6), and the Net Promoter Score was 45.0%. Most patients (17 [85.0%]) reported they were likely to change their diet to be healthier moving forward. Mean (SD) Feasibility of Intervention Measure scores were 19.8 (0.5) for community farmers and ranchers and 20 (0) for community partners. Significant preintervention to postintervention improvements were observed for food security (the number of patients who were food secure increased from 8 [40.0%] to 17 [85.0%]), KCCQ physical limitation (mean [SD], from 59.6 [31.3] to 82.7 [21.9]) and social limitation (mean [SD], from 74.6 [24.1] to 83.8 [25.0]) scores, CCS Traditions subscore (mean [SD], from 7.2 [2.9] to 7.9 [3.0]), and weight change among patients with obesity (mean [SD], −2.3 [3.3] kg). Conclusions and Relevance In this nonrandomized clinical trial, the MUTTON-HF intervention incorporating Indigenous recipes and locally sourced Native food was feasible and acceptable for patients with heart failure in rural Navajo Nation. These findings will inform a future randomized clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention to advance Indigenous cardiovascular health and food sovereignty.

    "Abstract": "This study characterizes a translin‐like protein from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , a unicellular alga. The efficient binding of the Cr translin protein to both single‐stranded DNA and RNA aligns it with the nucleic acid‐binding properties of the translin protein family, known for its roles in DNA repair, RNA metabolism, and mRNA transport. We report for the first time the presence of a translin‐like protein that forms octameric rings, is more closely related to rice translin, and is localized to an organelle not yet known to harbor such a family of proteins, viz ., in the basal body and flagella of C. reinhardtii . This study lays the groundwork for future investigations into the molecular functions of Cr translin and its potential regulatory roles in flagellar dynamics. Impact statement This is the first report of the presence of a nucleic acid‐binding protein, Translin, in the basal body and cilia.",

    "Abstract": "The suppression of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) TRIBAL in hepatocytes was recently shown to affect the expression of pivotal regulators and hundreds of poorly understood or uncharacterized transcripts. The most upregulated transcript corresponded to a predicted splice variant of the lncRNA ZFAS1 . Here, we characterize and investigate the role and regulation of ZFAS1 splice variants in liver cell models. New ZFAS1 splice variants were identified, all of which were enriched in the cytoplasm of HepG2 cells. TRIBAL suppression strongly upregulated a low‐abundance ZFAS1 variant in hepatocytes but not in hepatoma models. However, preventing the upregulation of the ZFAS1 splice variant did not mitigate the impact of TRIBAL suppression in hepatocytes. ZFAS1 variants were rapidly but differentially increased in response to thapsigargin, which causes endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). Inhibition of PERK, a central sensor of the UPR, had contrasting impacts on ZFAS1 variants in response to thapsigargin. Moreover, whereas the upregulation of the main ZFAS1 form was reduced by the suppression of the UPR mediators ATF4 and NFE2L2 (also known as NRF2), the other variants were not. Lastly, ZFAS1 suppression decreased cell viability both at baseline and in response to acute thapsigargin treatment. This work identifies novel ZFAS1 variants and uncovers a link between ER stress and ZFAS1 through the UPR.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Uterine dysfunction arising from surgical procedures such as curettage and caesarean section often leads to adhesions, hyperplasia and fibrosis, undermining women's fertility and quality of life. Conventional pharmacological and physical therapies cannot fully restore uterine function. To overcome these limitations, we designed a composite, polysaccharide‐coated silk nanofiber film as a staged scaffold to meet evolving healing demands. The hydrophilic polysaccharide layer provides early postoperative wet strength, conformability and physical isolation, while the underlying nanofibrous silk network mimics the extracellular matrix to support cell adhesion, proliferation and regeneration in later stages. In a rat model of severe uterine injury, implantation of this biodegradable film prevented postoperative adhesions and preserved reproductive capacity, achieving a fertility rate exceeding 80%. Mechanistically, the scaffold modulates the immune microenvironment by promoting M2 macrophage polarization, attenuating inflammation and accelerating tissue repair. It also upregulates angiogenic factors (VEGF‐A, PDGF‐BB), enhances type III collagen deposition and minimizes foreign‐body reaction, collectively driving effective in situ uterine regeneration. Fabricated via aqueous electrospinning and mild coating, the scaffold is cost‐effective, ecofriendly and readily scalable. As a biodegradable, staged platform tailored to dynamic uterine healing, this material offers a novel, versatile solution for clinical translation in uterine repair and broader regenerative‐medicine applications.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Injectable biomaterials with immunomodulatory functions have become a promising strategy to facilitate tissue regeneration. Material geometry is known to influence macrophage attachment and phenotype, providing opportunities for the rational design of “immune‐instructive” topographies to modulate macrophage function. Here, we developed a biomaterial systems consisting of two different “immune‐instructives” 3D geometries: sphere‐shaped microspheres (MSs) and rod‐shaped short microfibers (MFs) to modulate macrophage function for tissue regeneration. In the injectable biomaterials, we found that varying ratios of MSs to MFs in the composites significantly influence macrophage recruitment and M2 polarization, with high ratios of MFs potentially inducing scar formation. Through a systematic comparison of the promotive effects on tissue regeneration between MSs and MFs, we discovered that MSs and MFs exhibited a spatiotemporal synergistic effect on immunomodulation for tissue regeneration. Specially, MS rapidly triggered the foreign body reaction after implantation and enhance macrophage infiltration. Subsequently, the recruited macrophages underwent morphological changes upon contact with MFs, activating autophagy and polarizing toward the M2 phenotype, thereby accelerating collagen deposition. The developed immunomodulatory composites provide a promising strategy for engineering injectable biomaterials with immunomodulatory function that demonstrates desirable stimulation for tissue regeneration.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Nowadays, the implantation of occluder is an effective approach for treating patent foramen ovale (PFO); however, the slow endothelialization poses significant complications associated with occlusion devices. Herein, a 4D‐printed intelligent reconfigurable PFO occluder with pro‐endothelialization, anti‐thrombosis, and absorbability is designed. The combination of the occluder implantation and topical drug delivery of anti‐thrombosis drugs offers a solution to stroke. The occluder is designed based on the biomimetic structure, facilitating the integration of mechanical response behavior compatible with cardiac tissue. In vitro degradation and in vivo histological examination demonstrate the bioabsorbability of the occluder, and the anti‐thrombosis efficacy is preliminarily demonstrated through anti‐thrombosis experiments. The effective expression of VWF and CD31 markers validates the superior pro‐endothelial efficacy of the occluder. To summarize, the 4D‐printed occluder in this work represents an accessible strategy to combat PFO through integrated occlusion and topical drug delivery.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The efficacy of cancer therapies is often limited by inefficient drug delivery due to the highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME) and various cellular resistances, such as uptake and lysosomal escape. To overcome these challenges, we designed and synthesized three integrated polyesters through BODIPY‐initiated ring‐opening block copolymerization, BSN 1 ‐ BSN 3 , which incorporate an SN38 prodrug and a cationic positively charged ([12]aneN 3 ) unit. The optimized polyester BSN 3 was co‐assembled with DOPE, DSPE‐PEG‐iRGD, and Bcl‐2‐siRNA into multifunctional nanoparticles, BSN 3 ‐DR/Bcl‐2 siRNA NPs. This system achieves spatiotemporally controlled activation within tumors through iRGD‐mediated targeting for enhanced cellular uptake, followed by 660 nm light‐triggered photochemical internalization (PCI) to enable lysosomal escape, as well as high GSH/esterase‐triggered disassembly of NPs for sequential release of siRNA and SN38. The combination of Bcl‐2 protein silencing, chemotherapy, and PDT led to significant tumor growth inhibition at 95% in vivo in HCT116 models, without observable systemic toxicity. This work not only presents a novel cascade‐responsive combination strategy to overcome the limitations of monotherapy and physical combination of different therapeutic components but also offers valuable experimental evidence and theoretical support for the development of highly efficient and safe polymeric nanodrugs.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Twisted trilayer (Tt) transition metal dichalcogenides with multiple rotational degrees of freedom offer unprecedented opportunities for constructing large‐wavelength moiré superlattices to maximize the effect of correlated behaviors. Precisely stacking trilayer structures to realize ultra‐large moiré superlattices remains a significant challenge, hindering investigations of moiré‐tuned excitonic properties. Here we fabricate Tt MoS 2 via chemical vapor deposition, in which two commensurate twists of 2.7° and 21.9° are sequentially introduced from the top to middle, and to bottom layers. An unprecedented super‐moiré structure with an ultra‐large periodicity of around 24 nm is achieved, 30 times larger than that of 21.9°‐bilayer MoS 2 , hierarchically composed of periodical mirror‐symmetric triangular tessellation patterns consisting of five kinds of high‐symmetric stacking registrations and the relaxation regions resulting from the interlayer gliding. This robust ultra‐large‐period superstructure generates a deep moiré potential to effectively suppress intralayer moiré excitons recombination and be against intervalley exchange interaction at the magnetic field up to 9T, associated with the enhanced layer‐valley‐locked polarization by two‐fold larger than that of the trilayer systems with incommensurate angles. Our work presents angle‐dependent super‐moiré architectures in Tt systems as a versatile platform for designing moiré quantum materials with tailored optoelectronic responses, advancing applications in valleytronic and excitonic devices.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia, is closely associated with autonomic imbalance and inflammation. While low‐level vagus nerve stimulation (LL‐VNS) offers therapeutic benefits, its clinical application is limited by the need for surgical implants. Here, we present a noninvasive, orally delivered magnetoelectric neuroimmunomodulation platform that targets the gut–brain–spleen–heart axis to deliver LL‐VNS for AF therapy. The platform comprises ingestible microparticles (MPs) embedding magnetostrictive Fe 3 O 4 @BaTiO 3 nanogenerators (FO@BTO NGs) within a conductive matrix of poly(3,4‐ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which facilitates electrical signal transmission, and dopamine–alginate, which promotes gastric adhesion via catechol‐mediated interactions. After oral gavage in a rat AF model, MPs adhere to the stomach lining and, upon alternating magnetic activation, FO@BTO NGs generate pulsed electrical currents that stimulate vagal afferent fibers. This activates brainstem autonomic circuits, enhancing parasympathetic tone and suppressing sympathetic activity. Concurrently, it engages the splenic neuroimmune circuit via the cholinergic anti‐inflammatory pathway, thereby reducing systemic inflammation. This dual neuroimmune modulation significantly shortens AF duration and mitigates cardiac inflammation and electrical remodeling. These findings establish a clinically translatable, implant‐free strategy for delivering LL‐VNS through coordinated neural and immune pathways, offering a safe and accessible alternative to implantable systems for AF management.",

The sheath‐inspired hydrogels for soft actuator and transplantable substitutes primarily focus on high toughness and intrinsic lubricating ability, it remains a significant challenge to design the hydrogels with secreting lubricants capability for continuous lubrication like sheath. In this work, a sheath‐inspired semi‐convertible hydrogel is designed by cooperating responsive supramolecular networks (gelatin and polydopamine particles) into covalent polymer network (polyvinyl alcohol/poly(N‐isopropylacrylamide)). The interpenetrating covalent networks provide the high mechanical strength of 1.73 MPa and reversible contracting capability. The non‐covalent disassembly of gelatin network under near‐infrared light irradiation endows photothermal‐responsive dynamic lubricating function, which could reach superlubricity level (coefficient of friction of 0.007) by introducing hydrophosphatidylcholine in the hydrogel. The synergy of well‐lubricating capability and mechanical property of the hydrogel endows excellent durable property, which presents well elasticity after 15 000 compression cycles; and extreme low wear even after 100 000 shearing cycles. The developed hydrogel in this work is further processed into smart lubrication platform and photothermal regulation switch, which can broaden the application of smart responsive and interfacial lubricating materials.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Plant‐based, iridescent, and dynamically tunable structural colored materials are highly attractive for sustainable photonic devices. However, fabricating complex architectures at the decimeter‐scale with optical fidelity using plant‐derived materials remains challenging, limiting their use in photonic devices and adaptive actuation. Here, we introduce an aqueous two‐phase freeform fabrication strategy for vibrantly colored hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), where a robust immiscible aqueous environment is developed to preserve HPC cholesteric structures with &lt; 3% shift in peak reflection wavelength over three days, enabling stable processing of large‐scale structural colored materials. Our technique involves a food‐grade support medium with low interfacial tension, allowing for embedded 3D printing of photonic structures and post‐extrusion recovery of the HPC cholesteric domains. Intricate constructs, including interlocking chainmail, with feature sizes down to ∼50 µm and color consistency over lengths exceeding ten centimeters, can be achieved. Additionally, this approach can be utilized to create non‐planar, mechanochromic hydrogel actuators with programmable multicolor designs, as demonstrated in an octopus‐inspired hydrogel actuator and a color‐shifting display for information encryption, camouflage, and human–machine interaction. Our green, freeform manufacturing approach provides new design possibilities for sustainable photonic devices and can be applied to industrially relevant applications.",

The HZO/HfO 2 /HZO gate stack modulates grain size and suppresses ferroelectric variability, enabling precise multilevel control and highly linear weight updates via the incremental step pulse with verify algorithm (ISPVA). Electrical input induces long‐term memory, while optical excitation yields short‐term memory, allowing dual‐mode operation. Light‐driven 4‐bit reservoirs operate at picoampere currents (∼10 pW/device) and emulate nociceptive neuron behavior. Combining three wavelength‐dependent reservoirs (405, 450, 532 nm) expands the feature space and improves classification accuracy. Using ISPVA‐linearized readout, the system achieves 93.1% and 85.1% accuracies on MNIST and Fashion‐MNIST, respectively exceeding prior FeTFT/memristor‐based RC systems. This approach establishes a scalable, energy‐efficient route toward multifunctional in‐sensor neuromorphic computing based on a unified ferroelectric platform.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The electrochemical upgrading of glycerol into a single, valuable C 3 product remains a long‐standing challenge, constrained by the limitations of insufficient activity, low selectivity, and poor stability. Here, we report a ternary PdNiMo alloy catalyst that synergistically modulates the electronic structure and optimizes the surface *OH coverage for efficient and stable glycerol‐to‐glycerate conversion. Combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that Mo incorporation downshifts the d‐band center and weakens *OH binding, while Ni introduction optimizes the balance between *OH‐covered and free Pd sites. The resulting PdNiMo catalyst exhibits exceptional GEOR performance, achieving a high current density of 171 mA cm −2 at 0.8 V vs. RHE and a superior glycerate selectivity of 67.5%. More impressively, in a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, the catalyst demonstrates outstanding durability, maintaining a current density of over 50 mA cm −2 for more than 1000 h at a cell voltage of 1.2 V cell . This work elucidates the critical role of tailored hydroxyl coverage in selective oxidation and provides a design principle for advanced electrocatalysts in renewable energy‐powered electrosynthesis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Photon interconversion in semiconductors is of fundamental importance for digital imaging and quantum sensing. Nonlinear processes such as triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) offer photon upconversion (UC) at yields desired for solid‐state optoelectronic devices. Here, a multilayer molecular system where a near‐infrared (NIR) photosensitizer facilitates robust photon UC is presented. A molecular stack of 2,4‐Bis[4‐(N,N‐diisobutylamino)‐2,6‐dihydroxyphenyl] squaraine (DIB‐SQ): [6,6]‐Phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is optimized for UC by fine‐tuning the PCBM loading to engineer charge transfer states (CT) to amplify triplet generation. This composite photosensitizer layer, at a 1:3 blend ratio in heterojunction with rubrene, drives triplet population density to levels desired for effective TTA. When paired with a fully optimized annihilator layer of tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) doped rubrene, the sensitizer produces a photon upconversion quantum yield (Φ UC ) of 1.36% at 690 nm, with a significantly low excitation intensity threshold for the onset of the linear regime of I th = 60.5 mW cm −2 . Time‐resolved photoluminescence, transient absorption spectroscopy, and magnetic field‐dependent photoluminescence measurements reveal a detailed balance of photoexcited states and formation of charge transfer states of triplet character ( 3 CT), which work in tandem with molecular states to sensitize the triplet state (T 1 ) of rubrene. This approach of harnessing near‐infrared photons presents a promising avenue for advancing solid‐state photon interconversion.",

    "Abstract": "This article presents a haptic feedback system combining a flexible electromagnetic actuator with off‐the‐shelf components and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) platform to interact with the skin. The system translates targeted VR signals into localized, real‐time vibrations on the forearm. Existing actuator technologies struggle to balance flexibility, scalability, and control over displacement and resonance frequency ranges, limiting their suitability for wearable systems. Moreover, research‐oriented devices are highly specialized and costly, making them difficult to reproduce at a large scale. To address these challenges, we propose an actuator design framework with a tunable model that enables control over displacement and resonance frequency. Using this model, we develop a scalable actuator (12 × 12 × 3.6 mm 3 ) in a 6 × 4 array, leveraging commercial coils, mounted on a wearable sleeve. The device delivers displacements up to 15.8 μm at a resonance frequency of 220 Hz, aligning with the sensitivity of Pacinian corpuscles for high‐frequency vibrotactile feedback. To validate its performance, we implement a VR/AR case study using a Meta Quest 2 system to simulate a haptic laser pointer named “Haptix World” . Our key contributions include: (i) tractable actuator design model, (ii) high‐displacement flexible electromagnetic actuator, and (iii) complete human–machine interface pipeline that bridges VR interactions with physical haptics.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Breast cancer incidence is rising globally, presenting challenges such as treatment side effects and drug resistance. Bufalin is a bufadienolides compound with potential anti‐cancer effects. This study shows that bufalin inhibits malignant proliferation of MDA‐MB‐231 and MCF‐7 cells and protects mice against breast cancer. Of note, GTF3C4 was identified as the target protein by Limited Proteolysis‐Mass Spectrometry. GTF3C4 is overexpressed in breast cancer and associated with poor prognosis. RNA sequencing analysis reveals that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is a key contributor. Using cell thermal shift assays, drug affinity response target stability assays, and surface plasmon resonance, it was verified that bufalin can specifically bind to GTF3C4. Bufalin reduces GTF3C4 protein levels in vivo and in vitro, effectively inhibiting breast cancer progression by suppressing the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. After the knockdown of GTF3C4, the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is also suppressed, thereby inhibiting the proliferation of breast cancer cells and promoting apoptosis. Single‐cell RNA sequencing results indicated that bufalin reduces the proportions of macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes, and affects the strength of receptor‐ligand signals between cells. Collectively, this study demonstrates that bufalin targets GTF3C4 to inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway and remodels the tumor microenvironment, thereby hindering the malignant progression of breast cancer.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aberrant Notch signaling has been identified as a key driver of cancer development. Genetic studies in Drosophila showed that the knockout of strawberry notch ( sno ) mimics the loss of notch . Here, we found that Strawberry Notch 1 (SBNO1) is upregulated in several cancer entities and elucidated the role of SBNO1 in liver cancer development. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), SBNO1 protein was significantly increased and localized to the nucleus suggesting its involvement in gene regulation. SBNO1‐inhibition reduced cell viability, colony formation and migration and induced distinct expression patterns in HCC and CCA cell lines. However, BioID revealed that SBNO1 similarly modulates gene regulation in HCC and CCA by binding to general transcription factors TAF4 and TAF3. Deletion of Sbno1 in murine liver cancer cells Hep55.1C reduced tumor growth in vivo. In addition, inhibition of Sbno1 significantly reduced liver tumor development in three different mouse models of HCC and CCA. Furthermore, Sbno1 ‐deletion reduced biliary differentiation and angiogenesis in the tumor margin, underscoring the necessity of Sbno1 in Notch‐driven CCA formation. Thus, we identified SBNO1 as a transcriptional regulator required for liver cancer development and progression.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Noncompressible hemorrhage is a leading cause of death in both combat and lay settings, primarily due to the challenges in accessing and treating injuries deep within abdominal tissues where traditional compression‐based methods are ineffective. Existing hemostatic materials fail to address the needs of large wound cavities, necessitating the development of advanced materials with rapid expansion and superior hemostatic properties. Here we report an expandable hemostat engineered from a nanocomposite‐coated shape memory foam. This material exhibits rapid expansion, achieving a ~5X increase in volume within 3 min in vitro, and demonstrates notable shape recovery in vivo. The material's hemostatic efficacy is evident through a ~70% reduction in clotting time compared to untreated controls, primarily due to the ability to adhere platelets and red blood cells. Moreover, the composite material displays excellent hemocompatibility and cytocompatibility, with low hemolysis rates and high cellular viability. In vivo assessments further confirm its effectiveness, showing an accelerated clotting time (~80% reduction) and decreased blood loss (~50% decrease), alongside minimal inflammation and necrosis in histological analyses. Additionally, the composite demonstrates good biocompatibility following subcutaneous implantation, illustrating its efficacy in vivo. Overall, the synergistic effect of rapid expansion by shape memory foam, along with the excellent procoagulant ability of the nanocomposite makes this biocompatible, expandable hemostat a promising treatment for noncompressible hemorrhage.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This study investigates the influence of post‐processing techniques on lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) designed for miRNA delivery in in vitro transfection models. We compared blank and miRNA‐loaded LNPs (LNP‐miRNA) in terms of size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, electrophoretic mobility, and conductivity. miRNA encapsulation increases lipid particle size by 43.6%, due to structural rearrangements. Post‐processing methods, including sonication, filtration, dialysis, and thermal treatment, significantly alter particle characteristics. Sonication and filtration decrease particle size and improve uniformity, enhancing colloidal stability. Dialysis further refines the particle size but decreases its electrophoretic mobility. Non‐dialyzed, sonicated, and filtered LNP‐miRNA samples demonstrate the most favorable electrokinetic profile, maintaining low conductivity (0.003 mS/cm) and high electrophoretic mobility (3.16 ± 0.22 µm cm/V·s), suggesting optimal stability for gene delivery. Zeta potential measurements show that sonication and filtration increase the surface charge of LNP‐miRNA formulations from +18.9 to +29.3 mV, enhancing colloidal stability, while dialysis reduces it to +1.9 mV. Although sonicated and filtered LNP‐miRNA samples exhibited more favorable physicochemical properties, the dialyzed formulations modulate intracellular trafficking, resulting in earlier intracellular availability and prolonged persistence of delivered miRNA. This work establishes a framework for optimizing non‐viral miRNA delivery by showing how post‐processing shapes LNP stability and transfection performance.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype with poor prognosis. Here, we identify xanthatin, a sesquiterpene lactone from Xanthium species, as a potent inhibitor of TNBC cell growth with minimal toxicity to normal cells. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that xanthatin activates ferroptosis, evidenced by elevated ROS, lipid peroxidation, and Fe 2 + accumulation, together with GSH depletion and downregulation of SLC7A11 and GPX4. Target identification by drug affinity responsive target stability and mass spectrometry uncovered CDGSH iron sulfur domain 1 (CISD1) as the direct binding partner of xanthatin. Cellular thermal shift assay, surface plasmon resonance, and dynamics simulations consistently demonstrated that tryptophan‐75 is the critical residue mediating this interaction. Functionally, xanthatin promotes CISD1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thereby disrupting mitochondrial iron homeostasis and inducing ferroptosis. CISD1 destabilization further impaired mitochondrial integrity and activated PINK1/Parkin‐dependent mitophagy, establishing a dual ferroptosis–mitophagy mechanism. Importantly, genetic knockdown of CISD1 markedly attenuated the anticancer activity of xanthatin, confirming its essential role. In an orthotopic TNBC mouse model, xanthatin significantly suppressed tumor growth without causing systemic toxicity. Collectively, our findings provide the first demonstration that xanthatin directly targets CISD1 at the Trp‐75 site to trigger ferroptosis and mitophagy, highlighting its promise as a therapeutic candidate for TNBC.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Polyethylene nanoplastics (NP) and lead (Pb) increasingly co‐occur in agriculture, where their effects exacerbate phytotoxic impacts. We tested whether the endophytic entomopathogenic fungus, Metarhizium anisopliae , can mitigate individual or combined stress of NP and Pb in rice by examining fungus‐soil‐plant mechanisms using physiological assays, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and rhizosphere microbiome profiling. Rice seedlings were grown under eight treatments (individual or combined stress of Pb and NP, with or without M. anisopliae ). Individual and combined Pb and NP stress reduced seedling growth, chlorophyll content, and hormonal levels, while increasing oxidative damage. Pb and NP interactions showed synergistic toxicity, causing severe growth suppression and lipid peroxidation, and repressing photosynthesis and hormone‐related pathways. M anisopliae inoculation alleviated these effects and enhanced rice growth by reducing Pb uptake and translocation, restoring antioxidant and hormonal balance, and up‐regulating pathways including flavonoid biosynthesis, ABC transporters, and hormone signaling. Pb measurements showed fungal inoculation restricted Pb uptake as a protective mechanism. M. anisopliae reshaped the soil bacterial community, enriching taxa associated with plant growth promotion and contaminant tolerance. These findings identify M. anisopliae seed inoculation as a strategy to mitigate Pb and NP phytotoxicity in rice by integrating contaminant uptake control with plant and rhizosphere reprogramming.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This study explores tunable sound absorption using a bilayer configuration of phase‐gradient acoustic metasurfaces. By carefully adjusting the cavity length between two metasurface layers, the proposed system can modulate its acoustic response between highly reflective and perfectly absorptive states without changing the internal geometry of the unit cells. The underlying mechanism results from evanescent‐wave coupling, which becomes significant at sub‐wavelength cavity length and is strongly influenced by the phase gradient and integer parity of each metasurface. To analyze the scattering behavior of the bilayer system, an analytical model based on coupled‐mode theory is developed, identifying the conditions that ensure both reflection and transmission are effectively suppressed. Theoretical predictions are validated by full‐wave simulations using bilayer metasurfaces realized with space‐coiling structures. The results demonstrate broadband tunability in sound absorption, with optimal configurations achieving an absorption coefficient exceeding 95%. Owing to its structural simplicity and high tunability, the proposed approach offers an effective solution for dynamic sound control in applications such as tunable noise barriers and reconfigurable sound‐absorbing devices.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The ongoing demand for high‐thrust turbine engines necessitates the advance of next‐generation structural materials capable of withstanding higher temperatures. Commercial MCrAlY alloy, used as bond coats crucial for thermal barrier coating (TBC) systems, face a fundamental temperature ceiling of ∼1100 °C due to accelerated oxidation and spallation. Here, we design a novel Y and Hf co‐doped NiCoCrAl‐type multi‐principal element alloy (MPEA) that achieves exceptional 1200 °C oxidation resistance primarily through lattice distortion‐induced diffusion suppression. Compared with typical NiCoCrAlY alloy, the MPEA exhibits 59% lower in thermally grown oxide (TGO) growth rate, as well as negligible TGO spallation after 500 h at 1200°C. This performance stems from a significantly refined eutectic structure enabling rapid formation of a protective Al 2 O 3 scale during initial oxidation, coupled with lattice distortion that elevates vacancy formation energy and Al migration barriers within the Al‐depletion zone (ADZ), drastically reducing sustained diffusion rates. This co‐design strategy, integrating tailored microstructure and lattice distortion, establishes a new paradigm for ultra‐stable performance in extreme environments.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Sodium layered oxides Na x MO 2 ( x ≤ 1 and M = transition metal ions) have gained significant interest as sodium‐ion battery (NIB) cathodes owing to their high operating voltages and potential for higher energy density compared with polyanion and Prussian blue–type cathodes. However, their practical applications are often hindered by the irreversible structural transitions leading to capacity fading during cycling. The nature and substitution of transition metal ions define the material properties and electrochemical performance. In this study, through comprehensive electrochemical characterization combined with multi‐scale structural and spectroscopical analyses, we demonstrate the synergistic impacts of Lithium and Titanium doping, which not only increases overall capacity by boosting cation and anion cooperative redox contributions but also improves the rate capability and cycling stability. Specifically, Li + doping enhances the available sodium inventory for extraction, while Ti 4 + disrupts Na + /vacancy ordering at lower voltages (&lt; 4 V) and mitigates the detrimental P2→OP4/O2 phase transition during cycling. The combined effect of Lithium and Titanium doping promotes more charge localization on Oxygen, which activates reversible lattice oxygen redox reactions at elevated voltages, contributing additional capacity beyond conventional cationic redox.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT High‐temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT‐PEMFCs) suffer from severe performance degradation caused by phosphoric acid (PA) poisoning, which remains a critical challenge for practical applications. Unlike conventional techniques, herein, an electrostatic repulsion strategy is proposed to mitigate this issue by repelling the primary poisoning species (H 2 PO 4 − ) away from Pt active sites through the construction of a local negative charge environment. To realize this concept, oxidized sulfur (SO x ) groups are precisely incorporated into carbon support to generate localized negative electrostatics around Pt. Spectroscopic analyses and density functional theory calculations reveal strong Pt‐support interactions that spatially enable electrostatic repulsion. As a result, the as‐prepared Pt/C‐S O catalyst exhibits high oxygen reduction reaction activity and outstanding durability in PA‐containing electrolytes, far outperforming commercial Pt/C. When applied in HT‐PEMFC, the Pt/C‐S O catalyst delivers a maximum power density of 1166 mW cm −2 and maintains stable operation for over 500 h of continuous operation at 500 mA cm −2 , with an ultra‐low voltage decay rate of 26 µV h −1 , which is nearly two orders of magnitude lower than that of commercial Pt/C (1075 µV h −1 ). This study provides a mechanistically grounded and practically feasible approach to overcoming PA poisoning and durability limitations of Pt‐based catalysts in HT‐PEMFCs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Community coalitions have the potential to elicit diverse participants' perspectives on complex issues and generate shared commitment to adaptive strategies. Ideally, these approaches have been found effective elsewhere. Despite evidence that leadership plays a generally important role in coalitions, there have been limited prior findings about how leadership may support the use of evidence‐based practices. The purpose of the current study was to assess whether three facets of inclusive leadership—engaging communication, inclusive decision making, and inclusion of community residents—predicted the number, reach, and fidelity of coalitions' evidence‐based practices. The study context was 64 Pennsylvania and Missouri youth substance misuse prevention coalitions. Multiple regressions were used to estimate the lagged effects of communication, inclusive decision making, and inclusion of community residents on the number of evidence‐based practices used, their reach, and fidelity, respectively.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Electrocatalysis powered by renewable electricity is a promising strategy for clean energy transformation and achieving carbon neutrality goals. In resource molecules conversion (e.g., CO 2 and NO 3 − ), electrolytes serve multiple roles as reaction media, proton donors, and mass‐transport carriers, with their composition and physicochemical properties exerting a significant influence on reaction pathways, intermediate stability, and product selectivity. Most research endeavors have predominantly concentrated on catalyst design, often oversimplifying electrolytes as inert backgrounds. This minireview proposes a classification framework for electrolyte effects into short‐, medium‐, and long‐range interactions, highlighting their active regulatory roles at electrified interfaces. A comprehensive overview is provided of recent advancements in methodologies for investigating solvent effects, accompanied by an in‐depth analysis of representative electrocatalytic systems. This analysis elucidates how the composition of electrolytes influences molecular‐level elementary reaction steps, the dynamic reorganization and equilibrium of the interfacial microenvironment, as well as macroscopic catalytic performance, through a variety of distinct mechanisms. Finally, the key challenges and opportunities are also discussed, emphasizing electrolyte engineering as a strategic tool to reshape reaction environments and accelerate the practical deployment of electrocatalytic technologies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The electrochemical reduction of CO 2 and its co‐reduction with NO 3 − ions provide green pathways for the sustainable synthesis of methanol and urea; however, achieving the selective production of both compounds at low potentials remains a challenge. Inspired by natural Mo‐containing enzymes, we develop Mo‐on‐Cu nanosheets (Mo‐Cu NSs) via electrochemical reduction of CuO NSs followed by Mo deposition through electron‐beam evaporation. The bioinspired Mo‐Cu NSs deliver outstanding activity, achieving a urea partial current density of 2.39 mA cm −2 with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 52% at −0.2 V versus RHE, and a methanol FE of 65% at −0.5 V versus RHE, ranking among the most efficient electrocatalysts for co‐synthesis of urea and methanol. In situ electrochemical characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that interfacial electron redistribution between electron‐rich Cu and electron‐deficient Mo optimizes intermediate conversion pathways, thereby enabling potential‐dependent product selectivity. Specifically, *CO 2 and *NOH coupling accounts for urea formation, while *NO intermediates promote methanol production. This study not only provides a new electrocatalyst for highly efficient urea and methanol electrosynthesis but also can guide the design of other electrocatalysts for high‐value chemicals.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT To enhance the electrochemical performance of silicon electrodes, it is essential to comprehensively understand their underlying lithium storage mechanisms. Unfortunately, the vast diversity of silicon anode types and compositions complicates efforts to accurately predict and validate these reaction processes. Accordingly, a structurally well‐defined silicon‐based model compound is in great need. Thus, we select methacrylate polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (MAPOSS) as the subject for studying the lithium‐silicon bonding mechanism due to its clear chemical structure and composition. Through detailed characterization of the morphological and chemical structural changes of MAPOSS before and after cycling, our results reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the synergistic interaction (here termed as “Dynamic Self‐Organizing Lithium Bonds”) between Si atoms in the core and carbonyl (C = O) groups in the side arms of MAPOSS promotes reversible dynamic Li + ions storage. Density functional theory simulations further support this deduction. Furthermore, MAPOSS is employed as a binder in graphite anodes after polymerization. At 0.2 C, the resulting half‐cell exhibits an impressive specific capacity exceeding 450 mAh g −1 over 250 cycles. This study demonstrates that the integration of MAPOSS into the full cell configuration allows for a reduction in the N/P ratio and is expected to improve the overall energy density of the battery.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The evolution of Claisen rearrangements through expansion of the central atom from classical oxygen to sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus has reshaped the reaction manifold by redefining substrates, enabling new modes of selectivity control, and enriching product diversity. Here we report an aliphatic iodonium Claisen rearrangement of alkenyl iodanes with suitable nucleophiles. Substitution of the classic oxygen center by an iodine(III) moiety enables allyl alkenyl iodonium species to undergo rearrangement at −78 °C with completion in less than 0.1 s, while broadening the scope of rearrangement partners to include allyl/propargyl silanes, α‑stannyl nitriles, TMSN 3 , TMSOAc, and phenols, thereby expanding the structural diversity of accessible products. Beyond furnishing conventional rearrangement products, the rearrangement intermediates can be intercepted intra‐ or intermolecularly by diverse carbon‐ and heteroatom‐based nucleophiles, enabling dual functionalization of alkenyl iodanes. Mechanistic studies rationalize the unusually rapid kinetics of the rearrangement and reveal a pronounced trans influence exerted by the hypervalent iodine center, which not only governs the assembly of reactive partners but also facilitates the rearrangement.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Helicenes are privileged chiral architectures with exceptional optical and electronic properties, underpinning their importance in asymmetric catalysis, optoelectronics, and supramolecular chemistry. Despite significant progress in helicene synthesis, strategies for extending peripheral aromatic rings to access structurally diversified helicenes remain elusive. Here we report a synergistic catalytic system integrating a bifunctional phosphonium salt (BPS) with silver, which enables a highly efficient [4 + 2] cyclization/aromatization cascade to directly construct a new family of oxa[6]helicenes. This cooperative catalysis exhibits broad substrate scope, delivering chiral helicenes in excellent yield and enantioselectivity. Mechanistic studies reveal that Ag + activates the cyano group, while the BPS catalyst engages through hydrogen bonding and ion‐pairing interactions to form a unique sandwich‐type transition state. This dual activation mode provides a powerful framework for constructing helicenes with tailored structural diversity, paving the way for future applications in chiroptical materials and enantioselective catalysis.",

Herein, we develop four trimeric GMAs (named 3Y‐site, including wing‐sites‐linked 3Y‐Wing, end‐sites‐linked 3Y‐End, hybrid wing/end‐sites‐linked 3Y‐EWE and 3Y‐WEW) with the same alkylated linker but different linking sites to fine‐tune molecular optoelectronic properties. Among them, 3Y‐Wing with a superior planarity and extensibility possesses broadened absorption, better crystallinity, superior packing, and higher glass transition temperature, resulting in an optimized phase separation. The optimized devices with binary PM6:3Y‐Wing and ternary PM6:L8‐BO:3Y‐Wing achieve both champion PCEs of 15.0% and 19.1%, respectively, along with enhanced light, thermal, and storage stabilities, outperforming devices based on all other 3Y‐site counterparts. In the classic D18:L8‐BO host system, the effectiveness of 3Y‐Wing in boosting PCE is further validated, and the resulted ternary devices deliver an excellent PCE of 20.23%, setting an efficiency record among the reported trimeric GMAs. Moreover, the 3Y‐Wing based OSCs offer a better balance of high PCE and stability, further distinguishing them within 3Y‐site series. Our developed wing‐sites‐linked trimeric 3Y‐Wing is a promising candidate to achieve both high device efficiency and stability.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The oxidation of phosphine (PH 3 ) plays an important role in the photochemical phosphorus‐hydrogen‐oxygen network of the Earth's atmosphere. The phosphinyl radical (•PH 2 ) is a key intermediate in the photochemistry of PH 3 , and its reactions with O 2 yield phosphorus oxyacids as stable reservoirs via the intermediacy of yet elusive radicals. Herein, we report the identification of the simplest phosphinylperoxy radical H 2 POO• in gas phase reaction between •PH 2 and O 2 . The characterization of H 2 POO• with matrix‐isolation IR and UV‐vis spectroscopy is supported by D‐ and 18 O‐isotope labeling experiments and quantum chemical calculations. Upon photoexcitation at 410 nm, the matrix‐isolated H 2 POO• undergoes successive hydrogen‐migration to form two isomers HP(O)OH• and •P(OH) 2 . Further UV‐irradiation at 365 nm causes decomposition to yield the water complex of phosphorus monoxide (•PO), which can be photolytically converted to metaphosphorous acid (HOPO). The disclosed photochemistry of these novel phosphorus‐bearing molecules helps in understanding the photochemical network of PH 3 in the atmospheric and interstellar phosphorus chemistry.",

Herein, we report a scalable self‐corrosion strategy for large‐area fabrication of a Ru‐doped Pt/NiFe‐LDH catalyst on Ni foam (PtRu/NiFe‐LDH) with an area of up to 36 cm 2 . The incorporation of Ru modulates the electronic structure, enhances the adsorption of both OH − and GLY, and lowers the free energy barrier for OH* formation, thereby significantly boosting catalytic activity to achieve a recorded current density of 439.5 mA cm − 2 . Furthermore, pulse electrolysis effectively suppresses the formation of PtO x , ensuring long‐term stability. When integrated into a GLY oxidation‐assisted hydrogen evolution system, this bifunctional catalyst reduces the cell voltage by 1.01 V relative to conventional water splitting, while delivering 78.5% selectivity towards GLA and stable operation for over 120 h. This work establishes a viable pathway toward the industrialization of selective electrochemical oxidation of GLY to GLA by integrating advanced catalyst design with optimized electrolyzer configuration.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Reductive cross‐couplings have emerged as a powerful strategy for forging C–C bonds directly from electrophiles, circumventing the need for preformed organometallic reagents, yet they often suffer from limitations associated with heterogeneous reductants like Zn (e.g., poor reproducibility and scalability) or costly homogeneous alternatives such as TDAE. Inspired by prior explorations of hydrazide chemistry, we disclose arylhydrazines as inexpensive, readily available homogeneous sacrificial reductants that enable Ni‐catalyzed sp 2 ‐sp 3 cross‐coupling of aryl halides with secondary alkyl iodides under mild, operationally simple conditions using a Ni II precursor, bipyridine ligand, and hindered amine base. Optimization, substrate scope studies, and direct comparisons reveal superior yields and selectivity relative to Zn‐based methods, particularly for heterocyclic and electron‐rich partners, while calorimetry‐guided safety assessments and decagram‐scale demonstrations highlight enhanced thermal control, reproducibility, and practicality. Mechanistic investigations via UV–vis spectroscopy, 19 F NMR, and reaction calorimetry support a pathway involving hydrazine‐mediated Ni II reduction to initiate a Ni I /Ni III cycle, with benign byproducts (N 2 and arene), positioning arylhydrazines as versatile reagents for executing reductive coupling on scale.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Short‐fiber reinforcement effectively enhances rubber composites, particularly in terms of tear resistance, which is critical for applications such as tracks and tires. However, the poor fiber‐rubber interfacial compatibility remains a major challenge. In this study, a blend of natural rubber, styrene butadiene rubber, and butadiene rubber was used as the base matrix. Short nylon cords (SNCs) with two different surface treatments, untreated and resorcinol‐formaldehyde‐latex (RFL) dipped, were mixed into the rubber matrix at lengths of 0.5 and 1.0 cm and contents of 1–5 phr. The effects of fiber treatment, length, and content on the performance of composites were investigated. The results show that RFL treatment significantly enhances fiber‐rubber interfacial adhesion. Notably, the incorporation of RFL‐treated SNCs with a length of 1.0 cm at a loading of 2 phr increased the tear strength from 33.63 to 42.41 kN/m (approximately 26.1%) and the stress at 300% elongation from 10.56 to 12.43 MPa (approximately 17.7%), compared with the unfilled rubber matrix. Although the introduction of SNCs slightly increased abrasion loss, RFL‐treated fibers effectively mitigated this drawback. These findings demonstrate that an appropriate combination of fiber surface treatment, length, and loading is critical for balancing reinforcement and durability in short‐fiber‐reinforced rubber composites, providing practical guidance for the design of high‐performance rubber materials.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Low‐temperature β‐phase barium borate (β‐BBO) is an important nonlinear crystal, widely utilized for optical second‐harmonic (SH) generation. Recent re‐measurements of refractive indices in the terahertz (THz) range reveal that β‐BBO is a positive uniaxial crystal. Here, we report THz optical rectification (OR) and electro‐optic (EO) sampling responses in a 0.5‐mm‐thick β‐BBO crystal. Two temporally separated, polarization‐tunable THz pulses were observed and identified as forced and free THz pulses, respectively. We further demonstrate that distinct effective second‐order susceptibilities enable phase matching for SH and THz generation. Additionally, β‐BBO can be employed to probe intense THz‐induced birefringence in the probe laser pulses. This study establishes β‐BBO as a reliable material for THz emission and characterizes its THz EO sampling performance for high‐field THz detection.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Mandibular morphology in early hominins reflects both developmental processes and functional demands, yet the ontogenetic emergence of robust mandibular traits remains poorly understood. Here, we present cross‐sectional analyses of cortical bone development during early mandibular ontogeny across Paranthropus robustus ( N = 7), Paranthropus boisei ( N = 1), Australopithecus africanus ( N = 1), early Pleistocene Homo erectus ( N = 1) and Homo habilis ( N = 1), Pan troglodytes ( N = 29), Pan paniscus ( N = 34), and Homo sapiens ( N = 24). We examined the cortical thickness and the structural properties at two key regions of the mandible—the symphysis and the corpus between the deciduous molars. We find that cortical bone thickness displays strong positive allometry with mandibular height across all taxa, with relative cortical thickness increasing significantly during early ontogeny. This pattern reflects normal ontogenetic bone growth, potentially reinforced by rising masticatory demands. In P. robustus , disproportionate cortical thickening and elevated resistance to bending—measured by the second moments of area—emerge early and become more pronounced throughout development. In contrast, the early Pleistocene Homo shows cortical thickening and second moments of area comparable to those of H. sapiens , even though H. habilis shares external morphological features with Paranthropus . Across all taxa, the mandibular robusticity index decreases during early ontogeny, reflecting proportionally greater increases in corpus height. However, this measure does not differentiate groups in infants and slightly older juveniles, whereas second moments of area reveal taxon‐specific developmental patterns. These results highlight the value of second moments of area and, to a lesser extent, cortical thickening and robusticity index, for understanding ontogenetic and functional divergence among early hominins. They further suggest that robust morphology of Paranthropus stems from a distinct developmental trajectory established early in life.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT An interpretive phenomenological analysis was conducted to explore the marginalization and discrimination experienced by 10 international counseling students (3 master's and 7 doctoral) in CACREP‐accredited programs. Five master themes were identified from semi‐structured interview data. Participants’ experiences revealed subtle and covert marginalization , institutional invisibility of international identity , and interlocking systems of oppression , while responding to these challenges through acculturation and self‐advocacy , and building supportive networks . Moving beyond the traditional acculturation‐focused research on international students, the current findings highlight how relational, institutional, and systemic barriers create inequitable learning environments for international counseling students. Implications address the need for tailored support for international counseling students and call for systemic changes among faculty, programs, and the field of counselor education. By centering on the marginalization and discrimination faced by international counseling students, this study seeks to promote belonging, systemic inclusion, and equitable professional development environments.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT A new “Porphyrin‐Geländer” ( PoGe ) macrocycle rac ‐ PoGe[Zn, Zn] embodying a twisted butadiyne‐linked porphyrin dyad as the banister was designed and synthesized according to a previously published successful design principle for Geländer molecules. The C 2 ‐symmetric properties of rac‐ PoGe[Zn, Zn] were revealed by detailed 2D NMR analysis. Postsynthesis modification consisting of central metal ion exchange in the porphyrin moieties led to PoGe macrocycles rac‐ PoGe[2H, 2H] and rac‐ PoGe[Cu, Cu] and was demonstrated to lead to finely tunable absorption and emission spectra, reaching in the near‐IR region. CSP‐HPLC resolved all rac‐ PoGe[M, M] into their ( P ) and ( M ) enantiomers, which were analyzed by UV‐Vis, fluorescence and ECD spectroscopy. The absolute configuration was assigned by the exciton chirality method (ECM) and corroborated by comparing experimental and simulated ECD spectra.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Ammonia concentration acts as a “multifunctional structure‐directing factor” throughout the entire growth of Li‐rich Mn‐based oxide (LRMO) precursors in coprecipitation process. Thus, this study investigates the effect of ammonia concentration on the precursor structure and morphology evolution. It is verified that ammonia concentration can significantly influence the preferential growth of crystallites and the agglomeration behavior of secondary particles. At an optimized ammonia concentration, the Mn 0.675 Co 0.1625 Ni 0.1625 CO 3 precursor exhibited preferential growth along the (012) crystallographic plane, facilitating an ordered structural arrangement and suppressing the agglomeration of secondary particle. After lithiation, the resulting LRMO material exhibits an enhanced Li + diffusion, endowing the material with higher initial capacity, improved rate performance, and superior cycling stability. Furthermore, this work establishes a clear correlation between the lattice parameters of the LRMO material and its Li + transport and storage properties. These findings offer valuable mechanistic insights and a practical synthesis strategy for enhancing the electrochemical performance of LRMO cathodes by precisely controlling precursor crystallization and microstructure.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The development of innovative and sustainable synthetic methodologies is crucial to address the increasing demand for environmentally benign practices in all domains of organic chemistry. In this regard, harnessing visible light as the sole energy input is particularly attractive. Diazo compounds, being highly versatile reagents with notable reactivity and ready accessibility, are well‐suited for photochemical activation, which offers a promising, eco‐friendly alternative to traditional transition‐metal‐catalyzed processes. In this perspective, we report generalized photochemical pathways for the synthesis of benzene fused 1,4‐ and 1,3‐diazines from 1,4‐ and 1,5‐aza bis‐nucleophiles and various diazo compounds, employing water as the sole and distinct solvent under aerobic presence. These protocols involve the direct photoinduced generation of carbenes from diazo compounds, averting the need of any photocatalyst, which then opts [4+2] or [5+1]‐annulation pathway and offers distinct products. The detailed insights into the reaction pathways are investigated through several control experiments and DFT studies. Strategically it is also possible to construct a 5‐membered aza‐heterocyclic core applying the same photochemical approach. Finally, the late‐stage modifications of quinoxalinone and quinoxaline scaffold applying the photoinduced C‐H activation technique generate the structurally diverse spiroindene compounds, including steroid‐embedded di‐aza heterocycle.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Wireless local area network (WLAN) communication technology is widely used in both civilian and commercial fields due to its high transmission rate, good compatibility, and support for simultaneous multidevice connections. WLAN receiver front‐end (RFE) with high dynamic range and high linearity helps improve information transmission distance and speed. Traditional WLAN RFEs are typically implemented using the CMOS process. However, compared with the GaAs pHEMT process, CMOS exhibits several disadvantages, including higher noise figures, lower output power, and increased insertion losses. To achieve better RF performance, this letter proposes a WLAN RFE structure based on the GaAs pHEMT process that eliminates the need for negative voltage. This design achieves better noise figure (NF) and dynamic range without increasing circuit complexity. Measured results show that the WLAN RFE chip using this topology not only supports the four operating modes required for WLAN but also exhibits a lower NF of 0.7 dB and a higher gain of 16 dB in the RX_LNA mode, along with a P1dB of 17 dBm, all within an area of only 1 × 1.05 mm 2 .",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This work introduces a new SCMA‐OTFS (Sparse Code Multiple Access–Orthogonal Time Frequency Space) with index modulation (IM) for coordinated multipoint vehicular communication systems. The system is modeled as an uplink CoMP system with remote radio head and baseband unit. Users' messages are divided into data bits and index bits. The SCMA codebook encodes the data bits, while index bits specify active resources. Each data bit is converted into SCMA codewords using a variational transformer autoencoder with manifolds learning (VAE‐MFL)‐based codebook mapping. The SCMA‐IM aims to enhance spectrum efficiency and throughput by combining index modulation with the SCMA method. It uses the codebook index to encode information, allowing for extra information representation. The system uses SCMA and index modulation to encode data, identifying users by sparse codewords and index locations. The system then transforms the delay‐Doppler domain signal into the time domain to obtain a time domain symbol vector. These vectors travel across the wireless channel to a remote ratio head (RRH) mounted on road infrastructure. The RRHs wirelessly connect to a centralized baseband unit (BBU) after receiving signals from every user. The time‐domain symbol is estimated using a time‐domain LMMSE (linear minimum mean squared error)‐based OTFS detection technique. The delay‐Dopper domain received symbol is acquired, and user bits are recovered using SCMA decoding. A probabilistic recurrent‐based SCMA decoder is introduced to precisely recover user bits. As a result, ABER values of 2.00E‐05 for proposed bound and 2.25E‐05 for proposed Simulation are achieved with the proposed transmission power of 31 dBm.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Phagocytic activity of mesothelial cells is a rare phenomenon requiring careful differentiation from histiocytic hemophagocytosis to ensure appropriate patient management, as these phenomena could exhibit distinct clinical implications. In this study, we report a case of phagocytic mesothelial cells found in pericardial effusion that developed 18 months after allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for chronic active Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) infection. The patient presented with fever and dyspnea, alongside mild chronic graft‐versus‐host disease, affecting the shoulders and skin. Cytological examination revealed mesothelial cells containing intracytoplasmic lymphocyte‐like structures and hemosiderin granules, confirmed by Berlin blue staining. Immunocytochemical analysis indicated pan‐cytokeratin (AE1/AE3), calretinin, and desmin positivity as well as CD163 negativity, confirming their mesothelial origin. The ferritin level of the patient remained at 370.0 ng/mL. EBV DNA was undetectable in peripheral blood. The clinical course was favorable, without systemic complications or recurrent effusion. This case highlights the importance of accurate cytomorphological and immunocytochemical characterization of phagocytic mesothelial cells in post‐transplantation settings.",

Methods Randomized trials of digital interventions (web, app, computerized, chatbots, etc.) delivered to people with diagnostic, subthreshold, or self‐reported EDs were included. Random‐effects meta‐analyses were conducted to compute absolute rates of uptake, adherence, and attrition, while a narrative synthesis summarized engagement patterns and reporting. Results Forty‐eight trials were included. The weighted mean uptake rate from 44 intervention conditions was 89.7% (95% PI = 67.0–97.0) and the weighted mean adherence rate from 14 intervention conditions was 41.8% (95% PI = 0.9–83.3). These estimates remained similar in a series of sensitivity analyses that adjusted for biases, outliers, and when limiting to specific clinical population groups. The weighted trial attrition rate was 23.3% (95% PI = 0.8–54.4); for intervention arms specificially it was 29.7% (95% PI = 9.7–62.3) and for waitlist arms it was 18.7% (95% PI = 4.6–52.3). Attrition was lower in trials that had human‐participant interaction, offered therapeutic guidance, provided monetary reimbursement, tested a web/computer program (compared to a smartphone application), and had a longer follow‐up (&gt; 6 weeks). Reporting of engagement was inconsistent and heterogeneous, with nearly 90 different metrics recorded across trials. There was some evidence linking sustained user engagement to greater clinical benefit. Conclusion Findings offer practical benchmarks to inform future trial planning and highlight design elements that could be leveraged to enhance user engagement and retention.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective Individuals with eating disorders (EDs) often face significant barriers to accessing care, including prolonged waitlists and systemic delays. Digital interventions, such as mobile apps, offer a scalable way to enhance pre‐treatment engagement during this high‐risk period. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of MI‐Coach: ED , a program‐led mobile app designed to support motivation among female‐identifying individuals awaiting ED treatment. Method Twenty‐three female‐identifying individuals on waitlists at ED clinics across British Columbia, Canada, participated in a 4‐week single‐arm pilot trial of MI‐Coach: ED . The app delivered motivational interviewing–informed content through seven sequential modules containing reflective exercises, psychoeducational articles, and psychologist‐led videos. Feasibility was assessed via service‐provider uptake, participant enrollment, engagement, and retention metrics. Acceptability was measured using the user version of the Mobile App Rating Scale and adapted Technology Acceptance Model ratings. Exploratory analyses descriptively examined pre‐to‐post changes in motivation and related symptoms. Results Feasibility was constrained at the service‐provider level, with 6% of contacted sites agreeing to distribute study materials. At the participant level, 67.6% initiated app use and 44% completed at least four modules, and 78% completed pre‐ and post‐assessments, indicating partial engagement across the sample. Participants rated the app positively across domains of quality, ease of use, and perceived usefulness. Small‐to‐medium reductions in global ED severity and depressive symptoms, as well as increases in motivational confidence, were observed with confidence intervals that did not cross zero. Change scores were moderately correlated across select motivational and symptom measures. Discussion Findings suggest that MI‐Coach: ED was acceptable among users who engaged, while feasibility was substantially influenced by system‐level recruitment constraints and variable participant engagement. Observed engagement patterns were lower than those reported for general mental health apps but consistent with prior digital ED intervention literature, underscoring the importance of disorder‐specific feasibility benchmarks. Results will inform ongoing refinements and implementation strategies for a future randomized trial.",

A series of tests, including compressive strength and light transmittance assessments, were conducted, alongside modeling a residential building using building information modeling software. Light‐transmitting concrete samples were prepared using single‐mode optical fibers, plastic optical fibers, and waste‐tempered glass. The results demonstrated that light‐transmitting concrete with 1% volumetric single‐mode optical fibers achieved a 28‐day compressive strength of 39.2 MPa and 2% light transmission. Light‐transmitting concrete containing 5% volumetric plastic optical fibers also showed 5.88% light transmission and a 28‐day compressive strength of 44.89 MPa. The sample incorporating 14% by weight of broken tempered glass exhibited a compressive strength of 51.1 MPa with 1.15% light transmission. A two‐story residential building (1200 m 2 ) in Tehran was analyzed in the modeling phase, integrating light‐transmitting concrete blocks in a residential building, while solar panels are considered only as a complementary reference for contextual energy and economic evaluation. Energy analysis and return on investment calculations revealed that the optimal setup involved a combination of light‐transmitting concrete, conventional concrete, with an estimated return on investment period of 5.22 years. Finally, an economic analysis is performed to demonstrate how integrating a photovoltaic system can offset the higher initial cost of LTC blocks, reducing the payback period to a feasible range.",

The marked rise in paediatric hospitalisations for AN during the COVID‐19 pandemic highlights the urgent need for brief, targeted interventions in inpatient settings. Methods This case series explored the feasibility and preliminary effects of combining Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) and Cognitive Remediation and Emotion Skills Training (CREST) for eight female adolescents (12–16 years) admitted to a paediatric ward with AN or atypical AN. Over the course of their hospitalisation, participants received 20 individual CRT + CREST sessions in addition to standard multidisciplinary care. Results Neuropsychological and self‐report measures administered at admission (T0), post‐intervention (T1), and 6‐month follow‐up (T2) revealed significant improvements in central coherence, cognitive flexibility, decision‐making, theory of mind, and interoceptive awareness between T0 and T1 (all p &lt; 0.05). These gains were maintained at T2, with no further significant changes. All participants completed the intervention without dropout. Conclusion Findings suggest that CRT combined with CREST is a feasible, developmentally sensitive approach that may enhance cognitive and emotional readiness for subsequent therapy in adolescents with AN during inpatient care. Larger controlled studies are needed to confirm these promising results.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective Individuals with binge‐spectrum eating disorders (EDs) engage in varying degrees of maladaptive and adaptive exercise. Elevated shape/weight concern is associated with engagement in maladaptive and adaptive exercise. No research has examined whether specific facets of shape/weight concern (e.g., fear of weight gain) are associated with degree of maladaptive versus adaptive exercise engagement. Method Participants were 124 adults with binge‐spectrum EDs enroled in outpatient trials of Enhanced Cognitive Behaviour Therapy. Linear regression models examined associations between each facet of shape and weight concern concurrently at pre‐treatment and degree of maladaptive versus adaptive exercise at pre‐treatment (i.e., percentage maladaptive exercise episodes of total exercise episodes). We explored these relationships across treatment and diagnostic groups. Results Greater pre‐treatment fear of weight gain was associated with a greater degree of pre‐treatment maladaptive exercise ( p = 0.027).

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Intraoperative free flap failure necessitates prompt intraoperative decision‐making on alternative reconstructive strategies. In this study, we investigate the etiology and management of intraoperative flap loss. Methods Retrospective review between 2010 and 2024 at 6 institutions. Results There were 7423 free flaps performed with 46 instances of intraoperative flap failure (0.62%). The most common recipient subsite was oral cavity (27/46, 57%). Anterolateral thigh (ALT) was the most common flap type to fail (18/46, 39%), followed by the fibula (15/46, 32%). The most common reasons for total failure were clotting without observable vessel abnormality (12/35, 34.3%), poor quality perforator (11/35, 31.4%), and vessel spasm or intimal abnormality leading to clotting (8/35, 22.9%). The most common acute management was converting to an additional free flap intraoperatively (28/46, 60.9%). Conclusions Flap failure intraoperatively is rare. The majority of cases were acutely managed with an additional flap to provide defect coverage.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Accurate and efficient image segmentation is crucial in anatomy, histology, and pathology research. Conventional manual approaches are time‐consuming, whereas fully automated artificial intelligence segmentation requires substantial manual correction owing to inaccuracy. To address this, we developed SegRef3D, a tool integrating the Segment Anything Model 2 with multiframe tracking and interactive refinement functions, enabling streamlined segmentation workflows for anatomical research. SegRef3D is implemented as a standalone, offline desktop application that operates entirely in a local environment, eliminating the need for cloud‐based services. SegRef3D provides a unified workflow from data import to segmentation, object tracking, refinement, and three‐dimensional model export. Users can specify segmentation prompts through bounding box input, track objects across multiple frames with start–end range selection, and refine results using intuitive Add to Mask and Erase from Mask tools. Up to 20 objects can be handled simultaneously, with each assigned a unique color. The software supports the Standard Tessellation Language output for three‐dimensional modeling and includes volume measurement functions. The SegRef3D prototype, called Seg&amp;Ref, has been applied in studies using serial histological sections, correlative microscopy with block‐face imaging, and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging. Building on these applications, SegRef3D further enhances usability and enables a seamless workflow. SegRef3D offers an accessible, efficient, and accurate segmentation environment tailored for morphological and anatomical studies. Combining artificial intelligence‐powered automatic segmentation with human‐guided refinement in a user‐friendly graphical user interface bridges the gap between research needs and computational methods. By supporting applications that span traditional anatomy and modern pathology, SegRef3D provides a versatile platform for integrative morphological analysis. Its open‐source availability ensures its broad applicability in research, education, and clinical training in the anatomical sciences.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Automatic and accurate medical image segmentation (MIS) can assist doctors identify regions of interest (ROIs) more efficiently, and provide more reliable diagnostic information and treatment options. In recent years, the denoising diffusion model, known for its excellent detail expression ability and good generalization performance, has demonstrated promising effect in MIS. The existing diffusion‐based segmentation networks typically take the original images as the conditional information, and ignore the ambiguity of the ROIs' boundaries, resulting in inconsistent boundary predictions and inaccurate segmentation results. The variability in the size and shape of ROIs poses additional challenges when applying diffusion models to MIS. To solve these problems, we propose a multi‐scale boundary‐enhanced diffusion segmentation network (MBDS‐Net) for MIS to improve the accuracy of boundary segmentation. Specifically, we design a multi‐scale boundary‐aware enhancement (MBE) module to enhance the boundary restoration ability of the ROIs of different scales and shapes. Besides, we propose an attention denoising residual (ADR) module that focuses on extracting key features during the progressive denoising process, reducing the impact of noise on segmentation and enhancing the robustness of the model. Furthermore, we adopt deep supervision in the decoder to enhance the training convergence and feature discriminability of the diffusion model. We conduct experiments on three public datasets and compare our model to the existing advanced segmentation models to demonstrate its superiority in MIS.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The American Society of Hematology (ASH) recommends assessing venous thromboembolism (VTE) and major bleeding risk to optimize pharmacological VTE prophylaxis for medical inpatients. However, the clinical utility of model‐guided approaches remains unknown. Methods Our objective was to estimate differences in VTE and major bleeding rates and efficiency with prophylaxis guided by risk models versus clinician judgment. Patients were adults admitted to one of 10 Cleveland Clinic hospitals between December 2017 and January 2020. We compared real‐world practice with hypothetical prophylaxis recommended by model‐based strategies, including widely used risk scores (Padua &amp; IMPROVE) and locally derived Cleveland Clinic risk prediction models. For each strategy, we quantified the prophylaxis rate, VTE and major bleeding rates, and the incremental number‐needed‐to‐treat (NNT) to prevent one event (VTE or bleeding). Results Clinicians prescribed prophylaxis to 62% of patients whereas model‐based strategies recommended prophylaxis for 17%–87%. Model‐guided prophylaxis produced more VTEs and fewer major bleeds than real‐world practice, but total events varied among strategies. Overall, per 1000 patients, model‐based strategies produced 14.0–16.1 events compared with 14.3 for real‐world practice. The Padua &amp; IMPROVE strategy minimized prophylaxis but caused the most total events. The most efficient model‐based strategy recommended prophylaxis to 28% of patients with an incremental NNT (relative to no prophylaxis) of 80. Compared to real‐world practice, it reduced prophylaxis by 55% and total events by 0.14%. Conclusions Clinicians often prescribed inappropriate prophylaxis, highlighting the need for decision support. Model‐guided prophylaxis maximized efficiency by reducing prophylaxis relative to real‐world practice without increasing event rates.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Sleep is essential for recovery in hospitalized patients, yet frequent disruptions from medical care make rest difficult. Most prior efforts have focused on environmental modifications, often overlooking patients' role in advocating for their sleep. Objectives This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Inpatient Sleep Loss: Educating and Empowering Patients (I‐SLEEP) intervention in improving sleep duration and reducing medical care disruptions among hospitalized patients. Methods In this single‐center randomized controlled trial (NCT04151251), general medicine patients at the University of Chicago were randomized to either I‐SLEEP (sleep education, advocacy questions, and a sleep kit) or standard care (sleep kit alone) between July 2019 and March 2023. The primary outcome was patient‐reported sleep duration. Secondary outcomes included actigraphy‐measured sleep duration and continuity (efficiency and wake after sleep onset), as well as patient‐reported sleep disruptions. Mixed effects models adjusted for covariates were used for analysis. Results A total of 194 participants were enrolled. There were no significant differences in demographic characteristics between groups. Sleep duration and continuity did not differ significantly between groups. However, patients receiving I‐SLEEP reported fewer disruptions from vital sign monitoring (63% vs. 75%, p = .004), medication administration (49% vs. 61%, p = .003), and laboratory draws (57% vs. 68%, p = .009). These findings remained significant after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions I‐SLEEP did not increase sleep duration or continuity but reduced medical care disruptions. These findings suggest that patient education and empowerment may be effective strategies for reducing preventable care‐related sleep disruptions in hospitals. Further research should examine implementation at scale and potential long‐term benefits.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Disparities in risk and access to care can lead to a greater incidence of cancer, higher stage at diagnosis, and more frequent cancer‐related deaths in communities with high poverty levels. Risk prediction tools that do not take into consideration social determinants of health may underestimate mortality in these populations. We sought to determine whether an association exists between poverty and the ability of the end‐of‐life index (EOLI) to predict 6‐month mortality in hospitalized patients with cancer. Using a sample of 802 patients admitted to oncology in an urban hospital over a 6‐month period, we categorized patients according to the percentage of families living at or below the federal poverty line in their zone improvement plan codes. We applied an EOLI score of ≥40 as an indicator of higher risk of 6‐month mortality. We found that the EOLI score remained equally predictive of mortality across area poverty level groups. This finding suggests that the score can be used broadly as a screening tool to predict mortality risk in hospitalized patients with cancer.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT A comprehensive understanding of long‐term trends in near‐surface wind speed (SWS) and their underlying physical mechanisms is imperative for progress in atmospheric science, climatology, and energy‐related fields. Utilising observational data and simulations from 10 models, this study investigates the role of anthropogenic activities in the observed decline of SWS over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 1961 to 2014. The results show a widespread and statistically significant decline in the annual mean SWS across the TP. The models qualitatively captured this decreasing trend under all‐forcing scenarios. Detection and attribution analysis attributes the observed wind speed decline primarily to anthropogenic forcings, which account for most of the reduction, while natural forcings show no detectable influence. Among these anthropogenic factors, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were responsible for the greatest decrease in SWS over the TP. In comparison, the contributions from aerosol forcing and land use change were marginal; their negative regression coefficients indicate that they partially offset the overall weakening trend. The underlying mechanism involves GHG‐induced asymmetric warming. This warming weakened the pressure gradient over the TP by causing a greater increase in geopotential height over the mid‐high latitudes north of the plateau than over the regions to its south. These findings highlight the dominant influence of human activities on wind speed changes over the TP, with important implications for wind resource planning and ecological management.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to survey sport medicine physicians globally to evaluate how they treat patients with a first‐time shoulder dislocation (FTSD), specifically exploring the most common management strategies, the evidence or guidelines guiding these decisions, and the influence of demographic factors on these strategies and perceptions. Methods A cross‐sectional survey was developed and distributed globally from 14 October 2024 through 22 March 2025 to sport medicine physicians involved in the management of shoulder instability. The questionnaire assessed respondents' demographics, preferred management strategies for FTSDs, and perceptions regarding the evidence supporting various treatment approaches. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data, and regression analyses were conducted to explore associations between demographic variables and management practices and perceptions. Results A total of 326 respondents completed the survey, predominantly fellowship‐trained orthopaedic surgeons from North America and Europe. The most common management strategy was immobilization for 1–3 weeks, followed by physical therapy incorporating strengthening and proprioception exercises. Imaging practices varied geographically, with North American respondents preferring radiographic assessment and Europeans favouring magnetic resonance imaging at initial presentation. Surgical management or consideration for surgical intervention was most influenced by the presence of bony injury (81%), patient age (69%) and participation in contact sports (63%). Younger physicians favoured arthroscopic stabilization, while older respondents leaned towards open approaches. Conclusion While variability in the management of FTSDs persists, the results of this study demonstrate emerging trends towards consensus on critical factors for consideration in the management of such patients. However, despite the prevalence of guideline‐based management, a substantial proportion of respondents, particularly those over 55 years old, continue to base their practices on personal experience and training rather than standardized protocols. The development and dissemination of evidence‐based guidelines remain essential to standardize clinical practices and optimize patient outcomes. Level of Evidence Level IV.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Arthroscopic ligament repair is a standard treatment for chronic ankle instability (CAI). In patients with risk factors for failure, isolated repair (ILR) may be insufficient and augmentation techniques have been proposed. This study compared ILR with suture tape–augmented repair (LR + STA), hypothesizing comparable outcomes in higher‐risk patients. Methods In this retrospective, indication‐based cohort study, all patients who underwent arthroscopic treatment for CAI between 2019 and 2022 were included. Patients were allocated to two groups: Group A underwent ILR, and Group B underwent LR + STA due to pivoting‐sport participation, generalized ligamentous laxity or poor‐quality remnant ligament. Clinical evaluation was performed preoperatively and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months using the Foot Function Index (FFI), visual analogue scale (VAS) and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure–Sports Subscale (FAAM‐SS). Return to daily activities (RTD), work (RTW), sport (RTS) and complications were recorded at final follow‐up. Results A total of 105 patients (mean age 30.8 ± 14.5 years) were included: 44 in Group A and 61 in Group B. Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in all clinical outcomes from baseline to final follow‐up ( p &lt; 0.001). At 2 years, no significant between‐group differences were observed in VAS (1.2 ± 1.7 vs. 0.7 ± 1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: –1.6; 0.6), FFI (9.7 ± 13.5 vs. 5.7 ± 7.6; 95% CI –12.7; 4.7) or FAAM‐SS (86.6 ± 20.9 vs. 90.5 ± 12.9; 95% CI: –9.9; 17.5). No major complications or recurrences of instability occurred. RTS was significantly earlier in Group B (12 vs. 20 weeks, p &lt; 0.001), while RTD and RTW showed no significant differences. Conclusion Both isolated repair and suture tape‐augmented repair achieved excellent outcomes with no significant differences at 2 years. Despite being performed in patients with higher functional demands or greater failure risk, suture tape‐augmented repair demonstrated similar complication rates, no recurrence of instability and an earlier RTS.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose To assess whether large language models (LLMs) with advanced reasoning and live web search (LWS) provide recommendations concordant with evidence‐based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) developed by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and rotator cuff (RC) injury management. Methods Recommendations from CPGs were extracted and developed into a total of 46 questions ( n = 15 for ACL, n = 31 for RC). Four configurations were evaluated: GPT‐5 Thinking, GPT‐5 Thinking Deep Research, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Research. Concordance with CPGs, the primary endpoint, was independently evaluated by two orthopaedic surgeons. Citation integrity, the secondary endpoint, was evaluated against four criteria: 1—relevance, ensuring the citation was congruent with the response; 2—accuracy, confirming the citation metadata were correct; 3—existence, to rule out hallucinations; and 4—source quality, ensuring the cited source is from a peer‐reviewed journal. Blinding was performed by a third investigator, by anonymously randomising the order of LLM‐generated responses for each CPG recommendation. Results All LLMs answered ACL questions concordantly (100% [15/15]; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.2%–100%). For RC questions, GPT‐5 Thinking and Gemini 2.5 Pro Deep Research each had one discordant answer (96.8% [30/31]; 95% CI: 83.3%–99.9%), whereas the other two configurations were fully concordant (100% [31/31]; 95% CI: 88.7%–100%). GPT‐5 Thinking achieved 96.8% (231/239; 95% CI: 93.6%–98.6%) citation integrity, improving to 100% (176/176; 95% CI: 97.9%–100%) with Deep Research. Gemini 2.5 Pro showed substantially lower baseline performance (64.6% [173/268]; 95% CI: 58.5%–70.3%) but improved to 98.6% (274/278; 95% CI: 96.4%–99.6%) with Deep Research. Inter‐rater agreement was perfect ( κ = 1.0) across all domains, except for citation relevance, which maintained strong agreement ( κ = 0.88). Conclusions Contemporary LLMs with agentic capabilities can deliver clinically aligned answers concordant with CPGs on ACL and RC injuries, recovering from previous hallucinations. Built‐in LWS functions are particularly helpful in ensuring citation reliability. Although expert oversight remains imperative, Deep Research allows LLMs to be considered as a first‐pass clinical reasoning companion. Level of Evidence NA.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose The tibial slope is a well‐known risk factor for anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury. As machine learning continues to progress, it has become an increasingly explored tool for clinical screening and risk factor analysis. This study aims to develop and validate a prognostic machine learning model to predict the outcome of ACL injury from tibial anatomic parameters and identify the most predictive features. Methods A pre‐published dataset of coronal, medial and lateral tibial slopes and medial tibial depth was constructed using magnetic resonance imaging scans taken from 104 subjects (44 males: 22 injured, 22 uninjured; 60 females: 27 injured, 33 uninjured). The dataset was split into train‐validation and test sets to ensure robust model evaluation. AutoGluon‐enabled machine learning models, including XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, TabPFN, TabM, TabICL, MITRA and their weighted ensembles were trained and tuned with respect to the F2‐score across ten different random seeds. Two instances of the best‐performing model were developed: a default tested model (weighted ensemble from the default seed of 42) and a full‐dataset model (weighted ensemble retrained on the entire dataset). Global SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis was used to elucidate the most predictive features, and local SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis to provide interpretability for individual predictions. Results The default tested model achieved a 73.60% validation F2‐score. On the test set, it demonstrated a 95.44% test balanced accuracy, 95.24% F1‐score, 98.04% F2‐score, 100% ROC AUC, 90.91% precision and 100% recall. The full‐dataset model achieved an 81.30% validation F2‐score. The relative importance of tibial anatomical features were identified. Conclusions Overall, the study presented two prognostic models with moderately high predictive power to identify subjects with high likelihood of ACL injury. Decreased medial tibial depth along with increased medial and lateral tibial slopes were reported as top predictors for ACL injury. These models can potentially be integrated into clinical practice to assist clinicians in predicting the likelihood of ACL injury, but require external validation.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose To compare subscales of the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), concomitant injuries and failure rates between patients undergoing primary and revision posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (PCLR). Methods This study was based on three major Scandinavian knee ligament registries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark). Patients undergoing primary and revision PCLR between 2005 and 2019 were included. Demographic characteristics, concomitant injuries and KOOS subscales were queried. A 3:1 propensity score matching was performed (i.e., three primary PCLR patients were matched to one revision PCLR patient). Subjective treatment failure was assessed at final follow‐up and was defined as &lt;44 points on the KOOS knee‐related quality of life (QoL) subscale. Results A total of 135 patients who underwent primary PCLR (mean age, 30.0 ± 11.0 years) were matched with 45 patients who underwent revision PCLR (mean age, 29.0 ± 10.5 years) and analysed after a mean follow‐up of 21.7 ± 5.5 months. At the time of surgery, there was no difference in concomitant meniscus (40% vs. 36%, p = 0.63), cartilage (12% vs. 4%, p = 0.15), anterior cruciate ligament (53% vs. 40%, p = 0.13) and neurovascular (1% vs. 7%, p = 0.057) injuries. There were no between‐group differences in any preoperative KOOS subscales. Postoperatively, KOOS QoL subscale was significantly lower after revision PCLR compared to primary PCLR (35.9 ± 23.0 points vs. 51.7 ± 23.6 points, p = 0.005). At final follow‐up, 55% and 70% of patients met the criterion for subjective treatment failure after primary and revision PCLR, respectively ( p = 0.32). Conclusion Both primary and revision PCLR resulted in significant clinical improvements. However, more than 50% of the patients in each group experienced subjective treatment failure, indicating generally poor prognostic outcomes. Nevertheless, patients undergoing primary PCLR demonstrated significantly better knee‐related QoL compared to patients undergoing revision PCLR.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective To evaluate procedure‐related complications after ACSS and identify key influential factors that increase or decrease the risk of perioperative complications. Methods This single institution retrospective cohort study included 3401 patients who underwent ACSS by spine‐surgeons at a single institution from January 2015 to August 2023. Our main outcome of interest was perioperative complications after ACSS, divided into objective and subjective outcomes. Covariates included patient, procedure, surgeon, and institutional factors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with complications. Results Our cohort included 3401 patients averaging 55 ± 12 years and 50% ( n = 1689) were male. The objective complication rate was 4.44% ( n = 151) and subjective complications were 6.70% ( n = 228). Otolaryngologists were involved in 17% ( n = 591) of cases. On multivariable logistic regression, high volume (≥ 15 annual cases) surgeons (OR: 0.58, 95% Cl: 0.35–0.95, p = 0.030), and otolaryngologist involvement in revision surgeries (OR: 0.31, 95% Cl: 0.12–0.77, p = 0.011) were independent predictors of decreased odds of objective complications. Advanced age (OR: 1.04, 95% Cl: 1.02–1.05, p &lt; 0.001) and surgeries involving multiple (≥ 3) spinal levels (OR: 1.70, 95% Cl: 1.23–2.34, p = 0.001) independently predicted an increased odd of subjective complications. Otolaryngologist involvement in upper (C1–4) cervical spinal cases (OR: 0.28, 95% Cl: 0.08–0.96, p = 0.042) independently decreased odds of subjective complications. Conclusion Adopting a multidisciplinary approach with otolaryngologists as co‐surgeons in complex procedures and increasing surgeons' case volume may improve surgical outcomes, decrease complication rates, and improve quality of care.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective Transverse cordotomy with medial arytenoidectomy (TCMA) for bilateral vocal fold immobility (BVFI) can optimize a patient's respiratory status and promote tracheostomy decannulation, but has the potential to adversely affect voice and swallow function. We present the largest cohort to date evaluating the procedure's effectiveness and compare functional outcomes by etiology of BVFI. Methods Retrospective case series of consecutive patients treated at a tertiary care center from April 2014 to 2024. All patients who underwent TCMA for posterior glottic stenosis (PGS) or bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP) were included. Exclusion criteria were multi‐level stenosis and prior airway resection or reconstruction. We assessed rate of decannulation, Voice handicap index (VHI), dyspnea index (DI), eating assessment tool (EAT‐10), and cough severity index (CSI) scores and compared outcomes by surgical indication. Results Forty‐five patients were included and the majority had PGS (64%). Seventy six percent of tracheostomy dependent patients were decannulated. Surgical indication did not impact time to decannulation or number of interventions required for decannulation. DI was improved at 1‐month post‐operation and last clinic visit ( p &lt; 0.0001). DI was slightly improved for the PGS cohort at last clinic visit, compared to the BVFP cohort ( p = 0.04). There were no differences in VHI, EAT‐10, or CSI after surgery compared with baseline, or differences based on BVFI etiology. Conclusions TCMA is an effective surgical intervention for BVFI that provides a reliable rate of decannulation and improves respiratory function without compromising voice or swallowing outcomes, regardless of the BVFI etiology.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective A “Code Blue” is a term to activate an alarm for the resuscitation team for a patient who has a cardiopulmonary arrest. The role of a pediatric otolaryngologist in a tracheostomy‐related code blue case is not clearly defined. We aim to describe the role of pediatric otolaryngologists in pediatric tracheostomy code blue (PTCB) cases. Methods This retrospective study analyzed pediatric code blue cases in a tertiary care hospital from January 2019 to December 2022, before and after the implementation of a standardized PTCB that includes a pediatric otolaryngologist in the resuscitation team. Primary outcome variables included response time and survival‐to‐discharge of patients. Results The most common reason for code activation was reduced oxygen saturation. The leading cause for the otolaryngology consultation was tube blockage. Tracheostomy tube change was the most common intervention performed. The mean time of otolaryngology arrival was significantly decreased from 14.0 min pre‐implementation to 4.0 min post‐implementation ( p &lt; 0.001). While including all 48 PTCB events, pediatric otolaryngologist involvement was significantly associated with higher survival‐to‐discharge (94.4% vs. 66.7%, p = 0.028). While comparing post‐PTCB protocol implementation versus pre‐implementation, mortality declined from 23.8% to 3.7% with increased discharge rates, although this did not reach statistical significance ( p = 0.073). Conclusion Inclusion of a pediatric otolaryngologist in the resuscitation team reduces time‐to‐arrival of the pediatric otolaryngologist to the code blue activation site. Reduced time to pediatric otolaryngologist arrival and completion of interventions by pediatric otolaryngologist are associated with reduced mortality in PTCB events. Level of Evidence 3.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective(s) Vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT) is an efficient treatment for dizziness and vertigo, but its accessibility remains limited. This study evaluates the feasibility and performance of a machine vision‐based automated alternative—the Automated Vestibular Rehabilitation System (AVRS)—as a more accessible approach to delivering VRT. Methods Forty age‐ and sex‐matched adults without balance disorders or recent head injury completed one standard VRT exercise, X1, in seated and standing positions using the AVRS, which tracked real‐time head and eye movements. Gain, the ratio of eye to head velocity near the neutral head position, was calculated using median values and interquartile ranges. Test‐retest reliability (TRTR) was assessed in a subset of 20 participants using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) with 95% confidence intervals. Results All participants successfully completed the AVRS‐guided vestibular exercises. The n = 20 person test‐retest reliability subset returned after 27 ± 9 days. Mean VOR gain approximated the expected physiologic norms (~−1.0) across sessions irrespective of frequency (Session 1: −0.98 ± 0.04; Session 2: −0.99 ± 0.03). Overall reliability between sessions was moderate (ICC (3, 1): 0.59 [95% CI: 0.37–0.75], p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion The AVRS demonstrated moderate reliability and accurate VOR gain measurement in healthy adults, supporting its potential as a scalable, accessible tool for VRT delivery, with normative data to guide therapeutic progression in clinical populations.

In the framework of potential well theory and the existence of global solution, by a way of establishing a nonlinearly integral inequality without non‐increasing condition, we prove that ‐norm for the weak solutions is non‐increasing, and establish two decay and extinction theorems that incorporate two kinds of polynomial decay, two kinds of exponential decay and two kinds of finite time extinction. By a way of establishing an improved Hardy–Sobolev inequality and applying a non‐concavity method, we establish the four blow‐up theorems independent of the potential well depth with as the blow‐up criterion, where two of them are finite time blow‐up, one is at least exponential growth and blows up at least at infinity, the last one blows up at infinity, where is a nonlinear function of .

    "Abstract": "Increasing level of lead (Pb)‐polluted agricultural soils jeopardizes chia ( Salvia hispanica L.) sustainable cultivation. A pot trial was carried out to explore impact of MXene on the growth and Pb uptake of S. hispanica seedlings, aiming to reduce Pb buildup in S. hispanica . Pb treatment resulted in the reduction of photosynthetic pigment levels and biomass of S. hispanica seedlings, in addition to an elevation in the antioxidant enzyme activities. Under Pb stress, MXene treatment enhanced photosynthetic pigments, biomass, and activity of antioxidant enzyme in S. hispanica seedlings. MXene application reduced root and shoot Pb levelsas well as translocation factor (TF) in S. hispanica seedlings under Pb stress. In contrast to Pb treatment, MXene diminished root Pb concentration by 15%. The TF, carotenoid level, total Chl (a + b), and Chl‐a exhibited strong correlation with shoot Pb under Pb stress. Consequently, MXene utilization can enhance growth, impede Pb uptake in roots of S. hispanica seedlings under Pb stress.",

    "Abstract": "The “Queen of fruits,” Litchi chinensis Sonn. is esteemed for its delicious fruits developed from apetalous flowers that bloom on terminal portions of the current season's growth. However, its ability to transition between vegetative and reproductive phases is increasingly challenged by climate change. Litchi's sensitivity to climatic variations—including temperature, rainfall, and nutrient availability—profoundly impacts its flowering and fruiting. Deviations from optimal conditions often reduce yield. Climate change also exacerbates the cyclic vegetative flushes litchi undergoes. Typically, three flushes are required to support fruiting, with staggered emergence at 2–3‐week intervals. Altered climatic patterns disrupt this timing, compromising yield. Maintaining an appropriate C:N ratio is also difficult under shifting conditions. At the molecular level, climate change interferes with genes regulating flowering. Key genes like LFY/LEAFY and APETALA are impacted, potentially leading to dis‐regulated flowering. Hormones such as auxins, gibberellins, and ABA, essential for flowering and fruit retention, are also affected. Understanding and mitigating these effects are imperative for sustaining litchi production under evolving conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Protoplast culture and transformation technology offer a novel approach for developing new plant varieties. However, efficient protocols for isolating and transforming watermelon protoplasts have remained elusive. This study aimed to establish a robust protocol for high‐yield protoplast isolation and transient transformation. The objective was to establish a high‐yield, high‐viability mesophyll protoplast isolation system and to achieve transient gene transformation and expression. The results demonstrated that the highest yield (17.25 × 10 6 protoplasts per gram fresh weight) was obtained from true leaves digested for 16 h with an enzyme mixture containing 2.0% cellulase, 0.6% macerozyme, and 1.5% pectinase, followed by purification via sedimentation. Viability assessed by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) staining reached 83%. The recombinant vector pCAMBIA‐Super1300‐ ClBBM ‐GFP, harboring GFP as a reporter gene, was successfully constructed. Optimal transient transformation efficiency (64.9%) was achieved using 40% PEG6000 for 30 min. Subcellular localization analysis revealed that the ClBBM protein was predominantly localized to the nucleus.

    "Abstract": "Bioresources play a crucial role in promoting sustainable agriculture by enhancing crop performance and reducing reliance on conventional fertilizers. This study investigated the impact of biochar and Azospirillum inoculation application on the growth and fruit quality of cucumber under greenhouse conditions. Thus, cucumber seedlings were grown when biochar was applied to the soil at rates of 0, 5, 10, and 20 tons/ha, and Azospirillum inoculum was inoculated at concentrations of 0, 5, and 10 mL/plant. Overall, sole biochar and/or Azospirillum application improves the plant growth and fruit quality. Interestingly, the integration of 5 tons/ha biochar and 10 mL/plant Azospirillum significantly enhanced plant performance and physiology; including stem diameter (15.66 mm), plant fruit number (46.08), plant fruit weight (5.51 kg/plant), total marketable yield (7.23 ton/grh), total polyphenol content (TPC: 220.06 μg GAE/g FM), total antioxidant activity (TAA: 2.84 μg/g FM) and mineral content: Nitrogen (3.26%), potassium (4.76%), and calcium (0.78%). Control plants without biochar and Azospirillum application exhibited the lowest performance. The study highlights the synergistic benefits, improving crop productivity and fruit quality while reducing the use of synthetic fertilizers. Integrating biochar and Azospirillum supports optimized plant production and environmentally sustainable farming practices.",

    "Abstract": "Viburnum opulus is recognized as a medicinal plant, whereas V . japonicum shows promise as an excellent ornamental species. This research aimed to explore their responses by cultivating under four graduated shading treatments (0%, 25%, 50%, and 75% shading). The investigation focused on assessing photosynthetic parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence, chlorophyll content, and enzyme activities. The results revealed that V. japonicum cultivated under 50% shading exhibited the highest photosynthetic rate ( P N ), which was 2.28–3.5 times that of 0% shading treatment. It also showed the highest electron transport rate (ETR) and chlorophyll content. The chla, b, and total chl content were increased by 14%, 6%, and 12%, respectively, compared to 0% shading treatment, alongside the lowest superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. V. opulus cultivated under 25% shading had the highest chlorophyll content, exceeding the 0% shading treatment by 40%, 43%, and 41% in chl a, chl b, and total chl content, respectively. However, its P N values were the second highest among all treatments, only lower than those under 0% shading. These findings imply that a 50% shading is optimal for V . japonicum cultivation, whereas V . opulus prefers a 25% shading. V . opulus has less tolerance to shade than V . japonicum.",

    "Abstract": "This study deals with characterization of 12 popular Indian pomegranate varieties based on 36 morphological descriptors and 76 DNA markers. Twenty seven of 36 morphological descriptors showed polymorphism and identified 52 DNA markers that produced variety‐specific (30) and rare alleles (27). The low probability of identity (PI) values (4.0 × 10 −12 ) of 27 rare allele‐producing loci attested to their high discrimination power. Furthermore, principal coordinates analysis based on 27 rare alleles was consistent with the relationship of 12 pomegranate varieties inferred from their breeding records. Then selected a subset of eight markers to generate unique identifiers in the form of marker IDs and digital codes for 12 pomegranate varieties. Furthermore, multiplexing of 40 SSR markers allowed us to develop a low‐cost molecular assay for rapid and accurate identification of pomegranate varieties. Finally, tested the efficacy of eight markers by diversity analysis of 40 pomegranate genotypes and confirmed their ability to distinguish pomegranate genotypes. Through this study, we clearly demonstrated the application of 52 markers for varietal fingerprinting, construction of digital marker IDs and multiplex assay development for twelve Indian pomegranate varieties. Also demonstrated the application of these markers for germplasm characterization. These findings have implications for germplasm management and breeding efforts of pomegranate.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective To examine the association between published position on absorbable nasal valve implants (favorable vs neutral/unfavorable) and the financial conflict of interest (FCOI) of listed authors. Study Design Retrospective cross‐sectional analysis. Setting Research publications based in the United States. Methods We performed a retrospective cross‐sectional analysis of research publications identified on Google Scholar and PubMed reporting on outcomes of bioabsorbable nasal valve implants from 2016 to 2023. Articles were independently reviewed and coded as favorable or neutral/unfavorable. FCOI for physician authors was gathered from declared disclosures in the publication and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments Database (CMS‐OPD). Results Twelve articles (7 favorable, 5 neutral/unfavorable) with 32 unique authors contributing to 51 total authorships were evaluated. An FCOI was identified in 28/34 (82%) authorships from favorable articles and in 3/17 (18%) authorships from neutral/unfavorable articles, a difference which was statistically significant ( P &lt; .0005). Nondisclosures of FCOI were identified in 17/34 (50%) of favorable articles and 1/17 (6%) of neutral/unfavorable articles. The median sum of author payments for favorable articles was $305,660, and for neutral/unfavorable articles was $637. Conclusion Our findings suggest that FCOI with the product manufacturer is associated with a favorable published position on outcomes of bioabsorbable nasal implants for nasal valve collapse. The high rate of undisclosed FCOI highlights the need for more diligent reporting on behalf of authors and greater scrutiny from editorial reviewers. Level of Evidence 2.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective Academic meetings provide opportunities for collaboration and career advancement in the national spotlight. We sought to explore sponsorship opportunities by gender by investigating committee leadership, keynote speakership, and panelist‐moderator ratios from prior American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery (AAO‐HNS) and Combined Otolaryngology Sections Meeting (COSM) conferences. Study Design Cross‐sectional review of publicly available program conferencing. Setting Literature review. Methods Gender breakdowns of committee leadership and keynote speakerships were recorded from official AAO‐HNS conference programming from 2013 to 2021. Panelist‐moderator gender ratios were calculated for the AAO‐HNS conferences from 2023 to 2024. Society leadership representation and panelist‐moderator gender ratios were also investigated from recent COSM conferences between 2018 and 2024 via official programming. Results Between 2013 and 2021, analyses of the AAO‐HNS national conferences determined that women comprised on average of 29.6% of annual directorship roles (range 12.5‐37.55), 35.6% of board member positions (26.3%‐47.4%), and 25.2% of keynote speaker appointments (0%‐40%). Between 2019 and 2023, in COSM, women held on average 23.3% of available society chair/secretary positions and 19.0% of society president roles. The ratio of female:total panelist was positively correlated with female moderators. Conclusion Female representation in AAO‐HNS and COSM leadership and keynote speakerships has improved over time in recent years, and appears to be on par with academic otolaryngology workforce composition. However, male moderators presenting panels at both conferences had significantly fewer female panelists versus female moderators. This difference in national panel participation opportunities may impact career advancement and national reputation for female otolaryngologists.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective To compare the clinical outcomes of radiofrequency ablation of the intraturbinate segment of the posterior nasal nerve (RAPN) alone versus combined RAPN with CO₂ laser posterior nasal nerve neurolysis (RPN3) in patients with chronic rhinitis refractory to medical therapy. Study Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Single tertiary care center. Methods Adult patients with chronic rhinitis unresponsive to medical treatment for over 6 months who underwent either RAPN or RPN3 between February 2023 and May 2024 were included. Inclusion criteria were 24‐hour reflective total nasal symptom score (rTNSS) ≥ 3, rhinorrhea score ≥1, and NOSE score ≥11. Exclusion criteria included chronic rhinosinusitis, nasal polyps, and coagulopathy. Demographics and comorbidities were documented. Primary endpoints were changes in rTNSS, NOSE scores, and response rate (≥30% improvement from baseline) at 1‐, 3‐, and 6‐months posttreatment. Results A total of 101 patients were analyzed (RPN3: 76; RAPN: 25). Baseline rTNSS and NOSE scores were comparable between the two groups ( P = .144 and .414, respectively). Both groups demonstrated significant improvements in rTNSS and NOSE scores at all follow‐up points ( P &lt; .001). From 1 to 6 months, RPN3 achieved significantly greater improvements compared to RAPN ( P = .039‐.045), particularly in the rhinorrhea and nasal itching sub‐scores ( P = .003‐.039). Response rates for rTNSS ranged from 91% to 100% in the RPN3 group and 84% to 96% in the RAPN group. Conclusion Both RAPN and RPN3 are effective in treating chronic rhinitis unresponsive to medication. The addition of CO₂ laser posterior nasal nerve neurolysis (RPN3) provides superior symptomatic relief, particularly for rhinorrhea and nasal itching.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective To investigate trends in evaluation and management of patients with cCMV at a major pediatric center following the institution of universal cCMV screening. Study Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Tertiary academic hospital. Methods Patients &lt;18 years with a diagnosis of cCMV between January 2021 and February 2024 were examined. Three cohorts were analyzed: 2021 and earlier (before screening guidelines), 2022 (screening recommended but not mandated), and 2023 and later (universal screening). Patient charts were reviewed for workup and treatment of cCMV. Results 132 patients met criteria. There was a significant difference in age at first audiology visit following cCMV diagnosis between cohorts 1 (0.71 ± 1.8), 2 (0.26 ± 0.23), and 3 (0.07 ± 0.06) ( P = .02). There was a significant increase in the absolute number of mild hearing loss diagnoses in 2023 and later compared to 2022 (8 and 2, P &lt; .01), but no difference in severe to profound hearing loss diagnoses between the cohorts (5 and 3, P = .2). Between cohorts 2 and 3, there were increases in the absolute number of patients undergoing ID consultation (11 vs 24), ENT consultation (9 vs 22), and treatment with antiviral therapy (7 vs 9) ( P &lt; .01). Conclusions Universal cCMV screening decreased the age at first audiology visit following cCMV diagnosis. Universal screening increased the number of diagnoses of mild hearing loss. The number of patients undergoing workup for cCMV also increased. Additional research is needed to assess the long‐term audiologic outcomes and benefits of universal screening. Level of Evidence 4.",

Study Design This retrospective cohort study involved 1,088 patients who underwent oncologic head and neck surgery from August 2012 to November 2024. Setting Tertiary academic center. Methods The main outcome measure was 60‐day Emergency Department (ED) visit or readmission after primary hospital discharge following surgery. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage, as measured by state‐level area deprivation index (ADI). Results Predictors of re‐presentation within 60 days of discharge on univariate analysis include tumor stage 4 (OR: 1.52, 95% Cl: 1.01‐2.31, P = .044), longer primary length of stay (OR: 1.03, 95% Cl: 1.01‐1.05, P &lt; .001), and residency in the 4th quartile state ADI (OR: 1.54, 95% Cl: 1.03‐2.31, P = .037).

This study aimed to identify distinct obstructive sleep apnea phenotypes using unsupervised clustering and evaluate their association with surgical outcomes. Study Design Retrospective prognostic cohort study. Setting Single‐centre study. Methods Two hundred fourteen adults who underwent upper‐airway surgery for obstructive sleep apnea were analysed across 50 clinical and polysomnographic variables. The Leiden clustering algorithm was used to identify patient subgroups. Baseline characteristics and surgical outcomes, including changes in the apnea‐hypopnea index and oxygen saturation, were compared across the identified clusters. Results The analysis revealed 3 distinct patient phenotypes. Cluster 0 (n = 91) comprised older patients with lower BMI and a high frequency of respiratory effort‐related arousal. Cluster 1 (n = 73) was characterised by younger patients with higher BMI and severe apnea‐dominant obstructive sleep apnea. Cluster 2 (n = 50) was defined by significant anatomical obstruction and hypopnea‐dominant breathing patterns. The reductions in the apnea‐hypopnea index and oxygen desaturation index were significantly less pronounced in Cluster 0 than in Clusters 1 and 2 ( P &lt; .01). Conversely, Cluster 1 showed the greatest improvement, with a significantly larger reduction in the apnea index and a greater increase in the lowest oxygen saturation compared to the other 2 clusters ( P &lt; .01). Conclusion Unsupervised clustering of multidimensional data revealed obstructive sleep apnea phenotypes with distinct surgical prognoses.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Binaural beats, which induce brainwave entrainment, have reduced anxiety and sedative use. This study evaluated the effect of binaural beats on emergence delirium (ED) in children undergoing strabismus surgery under general anesthesia. Methods This randomized controlled trial included 73 pediatric patients aged 2–7 years receiving binaural beats ( n = 36) or noise‐canceled silence ( n = 37) during general anesthesia. ED was defined as a Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) score &gt; 12 or Watcha score &gt; 2. Primary outcome was the incidence of ED. Secondary outcomes included PAED, Watcha, and Faces Legs Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC) scores in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), intraoperative electroencephalogram band power differences, and PACU stay duration. Results The incidence of ED did not significantly differ between groups (38.89% vs. 54.05%; relative risk 1.39 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.84–2.31]; p = 0.287). However, PAED scores at PACU arrival, at 20 min, and the highest score during PACU stay were significantly lower in the binaural group (median difference −1 [95% CI, −3 to 0]; p = 0.026 at arrival; −4 [95% CI, −4 to 0]; p = 0.035 at 20 min; −1 [95% CI, −3 to 0]; p = 0.048 for the highest score). Watcha and FLACC scores, band powers, and PACU stay duration did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusions Binaural beat application during general anesthesia did not significantly reduce the incidence of ED. Exploratory analyses suggested a reduction in maximum PAED score, but this requires further study.

    "Abstract": "Abstract BACKGROUND The enhanced capacity for metabolic detoxification is a key adaptive strategy enabling insects to tolerate plant secondary metabolites (PSMs). This adaptation is largely driven by the transcriptional regulation of detoxification genes. Our previous work established the critical involvement of specific detoxification enzymes in xanthotoxin metabolism in Spodoptera litura . In the present study, we aimed to identify and characterize the transcription factors responsible for orchestrating detoxification gene expression. RESULTS RNA‐sequencing analysis revealed that, alongside transcription factors induced by xanthotoxin, the nuclear receptor hormone receptor‐like 51 ( HR51 ) was uniquely and consistently down‐regulated in both the midgut and fat body of S. litura . To elucidate the role of HR51 in xanthotoxin detoxification, we generated HR51 ‐knockout mutants using CRISPR/Cas9‐mediated gene editing. These mutants displayed markedly enhanced tolerance to xanthotoxin, accompanied by the up‐regulation of detoxification genes responsible for its metabolism. Mechanistic studies through dual‐luciferase reporter assays coupled with site‐directed mutagenesis demonstrated that HR51 suppressed the expression of detoxification genes through binding to the specific cis ‐acting element within their promoter. CONCLUSION This study uncovers a novel derepression mechanism in which suppression of the transcriptional repressor HR51 alleviates its inhibition on detoxification genes, thereby facilitating S. litura adaptation to xanthotoxin. These findings advance our understanding of insect counter‐defense against PSMs and highlight HR51 as a promising molecular target for the development of innovative pest management strategies. © 2026 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Science education continues to be shaped by cis‐heteronormative and Eurocentric norms that constrain how knowledge, identity, and legitimacy are constructed in classrooms. In this narrative inquiry case study, I collaborated with a trans and gender‐nonconforming high school biology teacher, Teacher Mateo, to examine how queer and Indigenous ways of knowing can disrupt these settled expectations. Grounded in queer theory and counterstorytelling, I conceptualize Spilling T as a method rooted in Black queer and trans cultural traditions, both a methodology and a praxis that centers relational, embodied, and community‐based knowledge. Through co‐constructed counterstories and iterative Spilling T sessions, two narrative threads were developed: (1) the revitalization of Indigenous identity as a foundation for relational and multiepistemological biology teaching, and (2) the cultivation of genderqueer identity to challenge binary logics and affirm queerness as inherent in nature. Findings illustrate how Teacher Mateo resists biological essentialism, humanizes LGBTQ+ identities, and distinguishes science epistemology from Indigenous and queer worldviews. This study positions Spilling T as a transformative counterstorytelling method for reimagining science education as a space of resistance, reclamation, and queer rightful presence.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Nanoplastics (NPs) pose an emerging threat to environmental and human health. Still, the impacts of NPs on the endocrine control of reproduction remain poorly understood, despite increasing trends of infertility worldwide. In mammals, reproductive function relies on the hypothalamus‐pituitary‐gonadal axis, centrally regulated by gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Disruption in GnRH neuron development or function leads to GnRH deficiency (GD), a genetic condition presenting delayed puberty and infertility. Yet, genetic causes explain only ∼50% of GD cases, suggesting a role for environmental factors in disease etiology. Here, we investigate NP effects on GnRH neuron biology by applying two established in vitro models: hormone‐secreting GT1‐7 cells and migrating GN11 cells. We show that NPs enter cells via non‐classical endocytosis, alter neuroendocrine function in GT1‐7 cells, and impair migration in GN11 cells. Transcriptomic analysis of NP‐exposed GN11 cells reveals differential expression of key genes linked to GnRH neuron development. Moreover, integrating these findings with exome sequencing data from patients with GD identifies rare NPAS2 variants in two males with severe pubertal delay. These results suggest that PS‐NPs disrupt key physiological functions of GnRH neurons and may act as novel endocrine disruptors, contributing to the pathogenesis of reproductive disorders.",

This study first examines the fundamental mechanisms, material systems, and fabrication strategies underlying SSL, followed by a detailed discussion of its application in ultra‐low‐friction components such as microswitches, sliding interfaces, microvalves, and microactuators. This study then summarizes the operating principles and structural modes of TENGs, highlighting their capabilities for self‐powered sensing and energy harvesting in scenarios including vibration detection, microfluidic monitoring, tactile interaction, and autonomous micro‐energy systems. The synergistic integration of SSL and TENGs is explored as a pathway toward realizing highly reliable, wear‐free, and energy‐autonomous intelligent microsystems. Finally, this study identifies key technological bottlenecks and outlines future research directions aimed at enabling scalable, long‐term operation of next‐generation MEMS devices.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Post‐translational modifications (PTMs) of proteins are used by natural systems to expand beyond the 20 canonical amino acids. The variation introduced at the sequence level by PTMs after expression leads to changes in both the structure and function of proteins. PTMs expand the chemical repertoire from which new biomaterials can be constructed. Inspired by the post‐translational conjugation of cholesterol to proteins, we have synthesized five new hybrid lipid‐protein biomaterials called Sterol‐modified polypeptides (STaMPs). These STaMPs consist of an elastin‐like polypeptide (ELP) conjugated to a sterol, namely coprostanol, epicoprostanol, androstanol, galeterone, or dehydroepiandrosterone. We show that STaMPs exhibit sterol‐dependent self‐assembly behavior, ranging from predominantly monomeric random coils for the most hydrophilic sterols to spherical micelles for the most hydrophobic sterols. Furthermore, the sterols modify the typical LCST behavior of ELPs in a predictable fashion depending on the hydrophobicity of the sterol appended.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The controlled synthesis of high‐performance tin halide perovskite nanostructures hinges on the coordination chemistry that governs precursor speciation within molecular inks. Here, we elucidate the complexation dynamics of SnI 2 with two benchmark Lewis bases widely used in nanocrystal syntheses: a strong primary amine (R–NH 2 ) and a weaker substituted phosphine (R’ 3 –P). Correlated in situ 1 1 9 Sn NMR and UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy, supported by density functional theory calculations, reveal that both ligands (L) form monomeric SnI 2 –L adducts, with R–NH 2 consistently exhibiting stronger coordination than R 3 ′–P, as quantified by the intrinsic bond strength index and interaction energies. Higher ligand loadings destabilize SnI 2 –L x complexes, particularly for phosphines, whereas we show that amine‐bound multimeric (SnI 2 ) x (R–NH 2 ) x (x = 2−3) species can be present at low ligand concentrations. These molecular‐level insights directly correlate with nanocrystal formation pathways. Stronger Sn─N coordination drives the emergence of 2D Ruddlesden–Popper phases, while weaker Sn–P interactions favor bulk‐like 3D FASnI 3 nanocrystals due to insufficient stabilization of early‐stage intermediates. Guided by this understanding, an amine‐free, three‐precursor strategy employing a strong zwitterionic ligand enables phase‐pure 3D FASnI 3 nanocrystals with improved optical and colloidal stability. This work establishes a predictive framework for designing robust molecular inks for tin halide perovskites and perovskitoid nanostructures.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Anti‐icing coatings have gained significant attention to prevent ice accretion on infrastructure surfaces, particularly in aviation, power, and transportation sectors, owing to their energy‐saving and satisfactory anti‐icing performance. However, dust accumulation on anti‐icing coating surfaces significantly weakens their protective performance. Dust particulates adsorbed on the coating surfaces via electrostatic interaction is challenging to remove by wind power or rain washing alone. Herein, the dust‐induced icing process is clarified, and the process is effectively suppressed by a self‐constraining lubricant (SCL) coating based on ionic liquids (ILs) and zwitterionic copolymers. ILs (EMIES), embedded into the PDMS matrix, enhance the coating's conductivity (≈2.04 S/m) to dissipate surface static electricity and prevent the electrostatic adsorption of charged dust particles. The zwitterionic copolymer in SCL coating is designed to constrain ILs via electrostatic interaction and provide hydrophilic segments to enhance anti‐icing as well as deicing properties (heterogeneous ice nucleation temperature of −27.9°C, icing delay time of 1458 s, and ice adhesion strength of 8.1 kPa). This SCL coating presents dust‐repellent performance and retains excellent anti‐icing properties even when suffering from dust deposition. Meanwhile, it still maintained low ice adhesion strength after 30 icing‐deicing cycles. This work establishes a new dust‐repellent and anti‐icing strategy for outdoor infrastructure.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Rechargeable zinc‐air batteries are promising candidates for grid‐scale energy storage; however, their practical deployment is limited by oxygen electrocatalysis inefficiencies and interfacial instabilities, particularly outside conventional alkaline electrolytes. In this work, zinc‐air batteries operating under neutral electrolyte conditions using ZnCl 2 soaked KC‐PAA‐PAM gel polymer electrolytes and electrochemically synthesized Ni/Fe layered double hydroxide electrocatalysts is investigated. Ni/Fe‐LDH is intentionally employed as an OER‐biased benchmark catalyst to diagnose electrolyte and interface driven limitations rather than as a bifunctional ORR/OER solution. Full cells exhibit highly stable cycling over hundreds of hours, yet operate at substantially suppressed charge and discharge voltages relative to the thermodynamic value. Electrochemical impedance analysis shows that ohmic losses contribute only minimally to this voltage suppression. Post‐mortem X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals metallic zinc accumulation on the air cathode and chloride‐containing species on the anode, indicating parasitic interfacial processes. Synchrotron‐based soft X‐ray absorption spectroscopy confirms stable Ni 2+ and Fe 3+ oxidation states during cycling, consistent with OER‐biased catalytic behavior, while neutral‐electrolyte oxygen evolution measurements demonstrate strong electrolyte‐induced suppression of oxygen kinetics. Together, these results show that electrolyte chemistry and cathode‐side parasitic processes, rather than catalyst identity alone, dominate voltage losses in neutral zinc‐air batteries, providing mechanistic insight into the fundamental challenges associated with neutral electrolyte operation.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Supramolecular self‐assemblies based on metal–organic coordination provide a tunable platform for constructing functional nanostructures on surfaces, with potential applications in catalysis, magnetism, and optoelectronics. Rational design of assemblies requires understanding how their electronic structures can be tuned by various factors, such as precursor design and substrate choice. While phase transformations can significantly alter both structural and electronic properties, most reported cases involve changes in chemical composition or bonding configurations. In contrast, systematic studies of geometric relaxation, which is modulated without altering chemical identity, remain limited, as such transformations often demand high temperatures that risk side reactions. In this study, we demonstrate a room‐temperature phase transformation in a supramolecular self‐assembly of Ag–carboxylate complexes derived from 3,5‐dinitrobenzoic acid on Ag(111), proceeding without any changes in chemical composition. Combining scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy with density functional theory calculations, we track a stepwise transformation among three distinct hexagonal lattices. The transformation induces subtle geometric relaxation that strengthens metal–molecule interactions, thereby modulating the collective electronic structure. Unlike previous studies on polymorphic organic assemblies, this work reveals a composition‐preserving, phase‐transformation‐driven route to modulate electronic structures in metal–organic coordination assemblies, enabling tuning of physicochemical functionalities in surface‐confined molecular architectures.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials have garnered significant attention due to their broad application prospects in information‐encryption and optical storage. However, chiral small‐molecule systems face challenges such as intramolecular chiral‐transfer confinement and low energy transfer efficiency, making it difficult to achieve breakthroughs in chiral optical properties using a single component. We propose a multistage chiral‐transfer‐strategy based on ionic hydrogen‐bonded organic frameworks (iHOFs), utilizing (1R/1S,2R/2S)‐1, 2‐diphenylethylenediamine‐(R/S‐DPEN) as the chiral source and 4,4′‐bis(2‐sulfonatostyryl)biphenyl‐(H 2 CBS) as the chromophore to synthesize R/S‐iHOF‐40 . Our study reveals that the introduction of an effective charge donor modulates the excited‐state energy gap, which is the primary reason for R/S‐iHOF‐40 ’s high quantum yield (QY) of 67.8% (compared to 5.41% for HOF‐R/S‐DPEN). Furthermore, the strong mirror cotton effect observed at 323 nm for R/S‐iHOF‐40 confirms effective intermolecular chiral‐transfer, while the crystal structure clearly reveals a double‐helix supramolecular assembly mechanism mediated by hydrogen‐bond bridging. Interestingly, the interference of water molecule motion within the structure on the chiral coupling between ions demonstrates the crucial role of hydrogen‐bond dynamics in regulating the chiral emission of the R/S‐iHOF‐40 excited state. This work deepens our understanding of the mechanisms of chiral‐transfer and amplification, and provides new strategies for the application of solid‐state chiral materials in information‐encryption.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Phase‐change random‐access memory (PCRAM) is an emerging technology for next‐generation memory owing to its high on/off ratio, simple fabrication, and excellent stability. However, its unipolar operation limits its ability to replicate the complex synaptic behaviors required for neuromorphic applications. Although unipolar PCRAM has been explored as a neuromorphic device, its performance is limited by the intricacies of peripheral circuit requirements. To achieve better bipolar operation, this study introduces a novel bipolar PCRAM structure by incorporating titanium interlayers into an SbTe‐based PCRAM device. The integration of titanium as an atomic migration moderator reduces diffusion pathways, thereby stabilizing the operating voltage to approximately ±0.6 V while increasing endurance to more than 8 × 10 4 cycles. Furthermore, various synaptic behaviors such as potentiation, depression, and spike‐timing‐dependent plasticity were reliably mimicked. Neural network simulations performed with experimental data from the device achieved 88% classification accuracy on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset, highlighting the feasibility of this architecture for real‐world neuromorphic applications. The proposed bipolar PCRAM structure simplifies circuit design and offers a scalable approach for efficient neuromorphic computing.",

This work proposes Oxalis ‐mimicking nanosheet arrays of MoS 2 /Au on carbon cloth (CC@MoS 2 /Au) to exert a “kill three birds with one stone” effect. First, the biomimetic architecture imparts the planar substrate with mechano‐bactericidal property, which is dependent on attractive interactions between sharp edges and adhered bacteria. Second, the integration of MoS 2 /Au nanohybrids triggers a photo‐bactericidal mode, and the coupling of Au nanoparticles guarantees smooth fulfillment for higher photocatalytic efficacy. Such a synergistic action allows for a nearly 100% inactivation efficiency toward E. coli and S. aureus . Third, the engineered CC@MoS 2 /Au exhibits electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness exceeding 40 dB in X band, equivalent to 99.99% impeding of incident waves. This work reported here to design of multifunctional platforms with antibacterial and electromagnetic interference shielding performance, which may create a powerful support to mitigate the issues of biological contamination and electromagnetic pollution in the field of modern healthcare.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Fusion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) with liposomes can be used to alter the properties of EVs to enhance their drug delivery capabilities. However, metrics for assessing fusion are not well established. Fusion efficiency, the most frequently provided metric, is often characterized in bulk, clouding distribution of fusion across heterogeneous EV populations, and lacking assessment of more precise physical effects of fusion. Here we applied orthogonal single‐particle techniques including nanoparticle‐tracking analysis (NTA), resistive‐pulse sensing (RPS), nanoscale flow cytometry, interferometric fluorescence imaging, and laser trapping Raman spectroscopy (LTRS), each with different limitations, to examine the effects of fusion. All techniques reduced particle number, while single‐particle fluorescence analyses revealed substantial differences in fused‐particle yield. Nanoscale flow cytometry and interferometric fluorescence imaging consistently identified freeze‐thaw and sonication as producing the highest numbers of fused vesicles, with freeze‐thaw generating the lowest proportion of non‐fused EVs and liposomes. Interferometric fluorescence imaging further showed that fused vesicles retained native EV membrane proteins, but that fusion also reduced the abundance of these proteins, indicating membrane perturbation. We introduce here a multi‐metric framework to evaluate fusion efficiency, purity, and physical alterations to vesicles, as a basis for comparing techniques and to support future optimization of engineered EV formulations.",

Therefore, we have two parts: one concerned with the statistical analysis and the second one oriented to a theoretical consideration explaining the statistical failure of a correlation, which we intended to be obvious. The analysis must surpass the anecdotal facts to explainthe logic of the two instruments, TBC and DIT.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT A growing number of wind turbines (WTs) across the globe are now reaching or exceeding their expected service lifetime; WT decommissioning is on the rise. Accordingly, questions pertaining to WT end‐of‐life have risen in importance in policy and practice. Yet, research on the various factors relating to WT decommissioning is relatively sparse. Moreover, the key assumptions underpinning that prior research (e.g., the lifespan of WTs, characteristics of WTs being decommissioned, and whether the site is repowered with new WTs) have never been empirically tested across a large set of decommissioned WTs. Leveraging a uniquely comprehensive and spatially explicit dataset of decommissioned WTs in the United States, this research analyzes spatial, technological, and temporal trends in WT decommissioning and develops a novel predictive model for WT decommissioning. Our analysis pinpoints more than 12,400 WTs that have been fully decommissioned in the United States., the majority of which have been relatively old (&gt; 30 years) and small (&lt; 200 kW). While a WT's age alone is a good predictor of the likelihood of decommissioning, other factors such as the size of the WT and recent performance are also important and significant predictors. Most sites where decommissioning has occurred have seen subsequent repowering, with repowered plants featuring substantially fewer WTs (−86 on average) and higher rated plant capacity (+62 MW on average). Many existing WTs in the U.S. are approaching the end of their expected life with roughly 7500 being 20 or more years old. Findings can help policymakers and stakeholders begin preparing for this potential wave of future decommissioning and repowering.",

Existing forecasting methods exhibit notable limitations: traditional machine learning models struggle with long‐term temporal dependencies, while deep learning approaches often overlook spatial relationships among turbines. This paper proposes TSG‐Net, a novel framework integrating multiscale decomposition, graph neural networks, and attention mechanisms. TSG‐Net employs three innovative components: a multiscale decomposition linear network (MDLinear) with learnable decomposition weights for adaptive temporal feature extraction, a spatio‐temporal graph network (XTGN) that constructs dynamic adjacency matrices based on real‐time wind directions for wake effect modeling, and an adaptive attention fusion mechanism for scenario‐specific weight allocation. Experiments on the SDWPF dataset demonstrate that TSG‐Net achieves MAE of 36.53 kW and RMSE of 45.17 kW, representing improvements of 8.3% and 5.7%, respectively, compared with the best baseline TSB‐GNN (39.85‐kW MAE, 47.92‐kW RMSE), with particularly strong performance during wind direction changes, extreme weather, and power ramp events.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Prescribing recommendations, communication programmes, and mandatory electronic prescribing were implemented in Lithuania to promote responsible use of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-related drugs (BZRDs). We assessed the impact of policy measures on benzodiazepine/BZRD prescribing patterns in Lithuania. Methods We analysed utilisation of oral benzodiazepines/BZRDs in Lithuania from 2018 to 2024, using national prescription data and wholesale medicines data. Benzodiazepines/BZRDs included (1) anxiolytic benzodiazepines; (2) hypnotic benzodiazepines; and (3) BZRDs. The policy intervention period spanned from November 1, 2020, to July 1, 2021. We used ARIMA models to assess monthly incidence, prevalence, and long-term use prevalence (≥ 180 days) per 1,000 inhabitants. Besides, the numbers of defined daily doses (DDDs) prescribed and sold to pharmacies per 1,000 inhabitants were studied. We estimated baseline slopes, step changes after implementation, and changes in slopes after implementation. Results In total, 717,590 patients received 6,974,059 prescriptions for benzodiazepines or BZRDs. Prior to implementing the policy measures, there were upward trends in incidence, prevalence, and long-term use prevalence across all classes. Following the implementation, monthly incidence stabilised and prevalence decelerated for anxiolytic benzodiazepines and BZRDs. The prevalence of hypnotic benzodiazepines showed a significant immediate reduction after implementation. Long-term use prevalence continued to increase for all benzodiazepine/BZRD classes after implementation of the policy. Before the policy measures were implemented, monthly DDDs sold to pharmacies were gradually declining for anxiolytic benzodiazepines, but were stable for other classes. In contrast, monthly DDDs prescribed were increasing across all classes. Following the policy measures, immediate reductions in DDDs sold to pharmacies were observed, without changes in slopes. The prescribed and sold DDDs converged after implementing the policy measures. Conclusion From a public health perspective, the policy measures implemented in 2020 and 2021 had only a limited impact on the prescribing patterns of benzodiazepines and BZRDs in Lithuania. They continued to be used long-term, highlighting the persistence of potentially irrational prescribing.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Diffusion MRI–based indirect indices of neurofluid dynamics, such as diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) and extracellular free water (FW), have been reported to have prognostic implications in glioblastoma. However, their clinical utility, replicability, and the relation between the tumor burden remain insufficiently investigated with inconsistent results hindering its integration into routine imaging. Methods Two datasets of isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype (IDHwt) glioblastoma were retrieved from The Cancer Imaging Archive (UPENN = 200, UCSF = 125). The automated DTI-ALPS (aDTI-ALPS) and the FW index was used as an indirect indicator of glymphatic function. Prognostic significance was assessed using Kaplan–Meier analysis along with log-rank test, and multivariable Cox regression including aDTI-ALPS and clinical variables such as age, and extent of resection. Associations between MRI indices and tumor characteristics were also evaluated. Results A higher aDTI-ALPS index was associated with longer survival ( P = 0.024 and 0.018 for both datasets, respectively; log-rank test), indicating its prognostic significance. Multivariable Cox analysis revealed low aDTI-ALPS as an independent factor for poor prognosis (hazard ratio (HR), 1.352; P = 0.050 and hazard ratio, 1.616; P = 0.044, respectively). Low FW index was associated with longer survival in UPENN. Additionally, the aDTI-ALPS index showed no correlation with tumor volume or tumor laterality, and the HR was smaller than molecular markers. Conclusion Automated DTI-ALPS and the free water index may serve as reproducible prognostic factors in IDH-wildtype glioblastoma, while showing no significant correlation with tumor burden.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Post-Fontan patients often face significant hemodynamic challenges, including systolic dysfunction and diminished cardiac output due to reduced preload and venous return. Long-term complications such as hepatic dysfunction and protein-losing enteropathy arise from poor venous return, increasing morbidity and mortality. Enhancing venous return could potentially improve long-term outcomes for these patients. This literature review examines the role of the skeletal muscle pump in Fontan circulation and evaluates non-pharmacological strategies to augment venous return, with discussion of mechanical compression devices as a potential translational application. A comprehensive literature search identified 26 studies focusing on the relationship between lower limb muscle mass, venous return, and cardiac performance in post-Fontan patients, as well as the efficacy of peristaltic leg pumps in enhancing venous return. Across included studies, higher lower-limb skeletal muscle mass and structured exercise interventions were consistently associated with improved functional and cardiopulmonary performance metrics in Fontan patients. Additionally, the use of peristaltic leg pumps in other patient cohorts enhanced venous return across various patient positions, suggesting an avenue for implementation in the Fontan patient. Peristaltic leg pumps may serve as a valuable tool in managing the hemodynamic challenges of post-Fontan patients, potentially leading to better long-term outcomes. Further research, particularly randomized controlled trials, is necessary to establish the efficacy and optimal application of these devices in the paediatric Fontan population.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Phytoplankton and zooplankton organisms are important constituents of the Antarctic marine food-web and play important roles in carbon export. This study analysed the composition and vertical distribution of zooplankton in association with phytoplankton community composition over a 20 h in February 2017 at a fixed station in the central basin of the Bransfield Strait. The water column was stratified, resulting in the dominance of cryptophytes in phytoplankton community. The zooplankton community showed a vertical distribution patterns linked to water column dynamics and food availability, which led an accumulation of salps at the surface during all sampling periods. Calanoid copepods were the main taxa in deeper layers. The consistent presence of salps at the surface highlights their potential role in shaping community structure. If sustained over longer periods, such dominance may influence trophic pathways and carbon flux by altering grazing pressure on phytoplankton and enhancing vertical carbon export through dense, fast-sinking fecal pellets. These findings contribute to a better understanding of zooplankton vertical distribution over short time periods and underscore the importance of further investigating the ecological implications of salp dominance in Antarctic ecosystems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) are a leading cause of coral decline on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), with the majority of their impact occurring during outbreaks. These outbreaks involve rapid increases in populations followed by abrupt declines, and spread between reefs via larval dispersal—a key process in COTS reproduction. Given the difficulty in quantifying dispersal empirically, predictions are instead formed using coupled models of ocean currents and larval biology. Previous efforts have linked dispersal models to COTS population dynamics, however do so indirectly, or at spatiotemporally limited scales. Using an improved set of dispersal estimates and expanded COTS monitoring data, we assess the role of dispersal in determining a reef’s susceptibility to outbreaks. Our results indicate that while there is minimal evidence that dispersal patterns alone drive outbreaks, once combined with COTS population data it becomes clear that dispersal still plays a major role. By predicting COTS populations on undersampled reefs, we estimate that, on average, reefs that have experienced an outbreak receive 50–100% more larvae than those that have not. This is irrespective of whether we assume reefs hold their long-term predicted average COTS abundance, or their predicted maximum abundance. Given the difficulty in directly validating dispersal models, these results provide evidence that highlights their utility in understanding marine population dynamics. Furthermore, our results emphasise the critical role of resolving dispersal networks in guiding COTS control efforts. Specifically, they indicate that suppressing larval production through culling may reduce the risk of outbreaks on downstream reefs connected via larval dispersal.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Enhanced rock weathering helps remove CO 2 from air and cools the Earth over geological time periods, while also promoting plant growth, but the molecular mechanism underlying enhanced plant growth is unclear. In this study, ionome and transcriptome analyses revealed the importance of trichome formation for the growth-promoting effects of olivine ground to enhance weathering. In Arabidopsis, the application of 10% (w/w) olivine improved plant growth (a 64.2% increase in leaf area) and caused a 24.7% increase in Mg accumulation determined by ICP-AES at 23 days after germination (DAG) under long-day (16 h light/8 h dark cycle) conditions. Elemental maps of olivine-treated plants at 10 DAG produced by micro-particle-induced x-ray emission showed that olivine significantly altered Mg, K, and S accumulation in trichomes on true leaves, suggesting that trichomes may be critical for olivine-induced growth. The growth of glabrous1 ( gl1-1 and gl1-4 ) mutants defective in trichome initiation was not promoted by olivine. A transcriptome analysis of shoots by RNA-seq from wild-type plants at 16 DAG indicated olivine suppressed biotic stress-responsive gene expression. Additionally, Zn homeostasis was disrupted by olivine in gl1 mutants, implying that decreased Zn availability may inhibit the positive effect of olivine on growth. Collectively, our data uncovered the importance of trichomes to the adaptation of plants to soils containing rock-powders for crop improvement and agricultural sustainability and suggest the possibility that applying olivine might modulate the growth–defense trade-off governed by ion homeostasis mediated through trichome development, leading to improved plant growth.",

We herein describe a new EP300::VGLL3 RMS and review/update reported cases (total: 6) to reappraise their outcome. All six reported EP300::VGLL3 fusion RMS cases originated exclusively in the tongue musculature of adult males at a median age of 48 years (range, 36–59). Nonradical surgery was the initial treatment in most cases, followed by variable re-excisions in most. Incomplete adjuvant chemotherapy was given to one patient. No metastases were recorded, and all patients with follow-up were disease-free at last follow-up (12, 34, 36, and 48 months). Histologically, all tumors displayed bland spindled to ovoid plump cells lacking clear-cut rhabdomyoblastic features and disposed into fascicular and storiform patterns. The tumor margins were infiltrating with entrapment of skeletal muscle fibers. Overtly malignant cytology, brisk mitotic activity, necrosis, lymphovascular, and perineural invasion were absent. Immunohistochemistry was consistently positive for desmin (6/6), and variably myogenin (6/6), myoD1 (4/4), and SMA (5/6). Fusion breakpoints were identical among all cases ( EP300ex31::VGLL3ex2 ). Given their indolent course after local excision alone, the noncommitted term EP300::VGLL3-fused rhabdomyoblastic tumor might be more appropriate for these tumors than the original RMS terminology to avoid overprognostication/overtreatment that the “rhabdomyosarcoma” label would imply. Reporting more cases is mandatory to elucidate the full anatomic and biological spectrum of this morphologically, anatomically, and genetically unique entity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a deadly malignancy owing to its late presentation and the limited sensitivity of current serum biomarkers and imaging for early detection. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which carry proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids that reflect tumor–stromal interactions, have emerged as promising biomarkers for early diagnosis, disease monitoring, and treatment response. Several EV-derived proteins, microRNAs, long noncoding RNAs, and DNA alterations linked to early carcinogenesis and therapeutic resistance have been identified. However, variability in pre-analytical handling and analytical platforms has hindered reproducibility. Global standardization efforts, such as European Liquid Biopsy Society (ELBS), The Blood Profiling Atlas in Cancer (BloodPAC), International Liquid Biopsy Standardization Alliance (ILSA), and Minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles (MISEV), are currently helping to unify methodologies for EV isolation and molecular profiling. Advances in analytical technologies have shifted the field from bulk EV measurements to high-resolution single-vesicle approaches. Techniques, such as nanoflow cytometry, super-resolution imaging, Raman spectroscopy, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering, enable the detection of rare, mutation-bearing, or functionally distinct EV subpopulations, which may enhance diagnostic precision. In gastroenterology, a major opportunity lies in integrating single-EV analytics with the endoscopic sampling of tumor-proximal fluids. EVs obtained from pancreatic juice, bile, duodenal fluid, or portal venous blood via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) provide spatially enriched molecular information beyond peripheral blood. Combining endoscopic access with particle-level EV characterization may allow real-time, mechanism-informed assessment of tumor biology and premalignant lesions, offering a promising strategy for early detection and risk stratification in PDAC. Together, these developments have positioned EV-based liquid biopsy as a rapidly maturing field with strong translational potential.",

    "Abstract": "Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer characterized by high rates of recurrence and mortality, especially in its advanced stages. Ferroptosis, a distinct form of programmed cell death, has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanisms underlying ferroptosis in melanoma remain poorly defined. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role of USP36, a deubiquitinating enzyme that removes ubiquitin from substrate proteins, in the ferroptosis of melanoma cells. Using A375 and SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells treated with the ferroptosis inducer erastin, we analyzed USP36 expression and evaluated its functional role through both overexpression and knockdown experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays demonstrated that USP36 stabilizes APEX1 through the cleavage of its K48-linked ubiquitin chains. We further employed USP36-deficient xenograft models to assess tumor growth and ferroptosis sensitivity. Our results indicate that erastin downregulates USP36, whereas overexpression of USP36 suppresses ferroptosis. Importantly, knockdown of APEX1 abolished the anti-ferroptotic effect of USP36. In addition, USP36-deficient tumors exhibited reduced proliferation and enhanced ferroptosis. Collectively, these findings establish USP36 as an oncogene in melanoma that inhibits ferroptosis through stabilization of APEX1. Therefore, targeting the USP36-APEX1 axis may represent a novel therapeutic approach for melanoma treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The aim of this study was to evaluate Viligen® NE (Alltech®, USA) as a feed additive for Penaeus vannamei reared in a biofloc system during the nursery phase, focusing on growth performance, intestinal microbiological analysis, and resistance tocold challenge. Shrimp post-larvae (41 mg) were fed for 6 weeks with four experimental diets: (a) 0.5 g Viligen® NE kg⁻ 1 , (b) 1 g Viligen® NE kg⁻ 1 , (c) 2 g Viligen® NE kg⁻ 1 , and (d) a control diet (0 g Viligen® NE kg⁻ 1 ). The experiment was conducted in quadruplicate, totaling 16 experimental tanks, with a stocking density of 2000 post-larvae m⁻ 3 . Shrimp growth performance parameters were positively influenced by the inclusion of Viligen® NE in the diet. Polynomial regression indicated an optimal inclusion level of 1.17 g kg⁻ 1 for maximizing specific growth rate and weight gain. Additionally, supplementation at 1 g kg⁻ 1 enhanced shrimp resistance to cold challenge. However, no significant differences were observed in intestinal counts of total heterotrophic bacteria or Vibrio spp. among treatments. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with Viligen® NE at an optimal level of 1.17 g kg⁻ 1 improved growth performance, and 1 g kg⁻ 1 enhanced cold challenge resistance of nursery-phase shrimp reared in a biofloc system.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper considers a robot moving in a 3D environment that is tasked with estimating a quasi-stationary environmental field (e.g., temperature, concentration of a chemical pollutant, or distribution of light radiation density) in the presence of localization uncertainties, as is typical in underwater or other GPS-denied environments. Gaussian process regression has been widely adopted to model environmental fields. However, a drawback of Gaussian process regression is its difficulty in accounting for data with uncertain input. This work proposes a novel multi-fidelity Gaussian process-based regression approach to address the challenge by splitting the data collected by the robot into different datasets corresponding to the amount of input (localization) uncertainty. Furthermore, a sampling-based trajectory planning algorithm is proposed for adaptive robot exploration that optimizes a field-reconstruction objective function while accommodating resource constraints. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated using a miniature gliding robotic fish that measures light intensity in a large indoor tank. The adaptive exploration algorithm is tested using both a multi-fidelity Gaussian process model and a baseline single-fidelity model. Two objective functions, based on the information gain and an ergodic metric, respectively, are adopted in the evaluation. The experiments show that, for both objective functions, using multi-fidelity Gaussian process reduces the weighted mean squared error between the model prediction and the ground-truth field compared to using the baseline single-fidelity model that ignores localization uncertainty.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Do large language models (LLMs) generate unbiased financial advice across investor and fund manager demographics? We develop a two-sided audit framework to evaluate demographic bias in LLM-generated investment advice and apply it to multiple large language models, with GPT-4 Turbo as the primary baseline. On the investor side, fund selections are similar across demographic groups and rely on financial criteria, but recommended investment amounts vary when investor names signal race or gender, despite identical age and income. On the fund manager side, capital allocations favor non-Black and male managers: racial disparities persist even under explicit disclosure, while gender-related differences are more pronounced under name-based cues. Bias patterns are qualitatively similar across models, with differences in magnitude between implicit and explicit demographic signaling. These results suggest that, even when LLMs incorporate core financial reasoning, demographic signals can affect allocation decisions, with effects that tend to be stronger under implicit signaling, potentially replicating existing market inequalities and raising concerns about impartiality in financial advising. The proposed audit framework provides a generalizable approach for identifying and evaluating demographic bias in AI-driven financial advisory systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Uruguay has the highest colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality rate in the world, given the high prevalence of risk factors and low screening rates. Despite national guidelines recommending regular FIT screening between the ages of 50 and 74, less than half of the eligible population has obtained the test. Clearly, efforts are needed to increase screening rates. Little is known, however, about factors that promote FIT uptake among Uruguayans. To address this research gap, a theoretical analysis was conducted based on the health literacy model, to understand the relative contribution of individual and organizational health literacy variables in screening behaviors. Method Through community-based outreach, a national sample of 398 Uruguayan women and men was recruited. Participants had never been diagnosed with CRC and were 50 to 74 years of age, consistent with national screening guidelines. Results Analyses showed that when examining individual health literacy, knowledge of cancer more generally, and of CRC in particular, had the largest predictive value. However, when adding organizational health literacy variables to the model, recommendation by a health care provider yielded odds of screening 210 times higher. Conclusion The dramatic effect of a provider’s recommendation has important implications for future theory building, research, and practice. Additionally, this study supports the use of a health literacy conceptualization to understand predictors of cancer screening in Uruguay.",

    "Abstract": "Wilms' tumor 1-associated protein 1 (WTAP) is an epitranscriptomic regulator with multifaceted roles in cancer biology. Acting beyond its function in the m6A methyltransferase complex, WTAP governs RNA splicing, stability, and translation, influencing oncogenic signaling, immune modulation, and therapy resistance. Recent evidence reveals its dynamic involvement in diverse malignancies, where it can act as both an oncogene and tumor suppressor depending on the cellular context. WTAP promotes tumor progression through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), metabolic reprogramming, angiogenesis, and immune evasion, and contributes to resistance against chemotherapy and immunotherapy by regulating DNA repair, ferroptosis, and immune checkpoint pathways. However, studies have also demonstrated that WTAP can exert tumor-suppressive effects under specific physiological conditions, such as hepatocyte-specific WTAP loss leading to extracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERK)-driven hepatocarcinogenesis, and WTAP-mediated m6A regulation restraining oncogenic signaling in some prostate cancers. Moreover, by enhancing ferroptosis resistance, WTAP may weaken ferroptosis-driven antitumor immunity and contribute to immune-checkpoint resistance. Understanding these mechanisms offers opportunities for exploiting WTAP as a biomarker and therapeutic target across multiple cancer types. This review explores the multifaceted role of WTAP in cancer, focusing on its mechanisms of action in tumorigenesis, immune modulation, and therapy resistance, and offers insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting WTAP in cancer treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this paper is to explore the literature on knowledge management for innovation and sustainable development, to unveil the main research trends developed over time. To contextualize the field under study, bibliometric techniques are used, while traditional methods of systematic literature review are employed to deepen the study and discover the main trends developed over time. The software chosen for this research is Bibliometrix ® , which has been combined with an innovative three-level systematic analysis of keywords, co-occurrence of keywords and analysis of the abstracts of the 793 peer-reviewed articles that make up the database obtained from Web of Science. The findings reveal six relevant subtopics focused on the interconnectedness of knowledge management with some key factors for firms’ competitiveness. It is concluded that effective knowledge management practices disseminate knowledge within and between organizations, teams, and departments, nurturing a culture of continuous learning and cross-functional collaboration. This research significantly contributes to the understanding of the interplay between knowledge management, innovation and sustainable development, as well as providing guidance to policymakers in developing regulations and incentives that support the development of sustainable business models, eco-innovation and efficient knowledge management, and to organizations on how they can apply knowledge management practices to foster innovation, streamline operations and adapt to changing markets and environmental conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Most empirical studies on PhD students’ competencies lack a conceptual framework, and no study has examined a comprehensive list of competencies necessary for both an academic and a non-academic career. The study pioneered the operationalization of (Shin’s Higher Education Forum, 16 , 27–43, 2019) conceptualization of the competencies that novice academics and knowledge professionals need to possess. Furthermore, the present study investigated how research styles, as a study resource, statistically predicted PhD students’ perceived competencies. Based on data from the 1,105 PhD students in Hong Kong (509 participants randomly assigned to the calibration group and 596 to the cross-validation group), a seven-scale inventory —the PhD Students’ Perceived Competencies Inventory (PSPCI)—was established. This inventory consists of 23 items across the following scales: core competencies (CC), job performance-novice academics (JP-NA), job performance-novice knowledge professionals (JP-NKP), understanding the work environment-novice academics (UWE-NA), understanding the work environment-novice knowledge professionals (UWE-NKP), identity development (ID), and professional habits (PH). Moreover, based on data obtained from the 1,105 PhD students, it was found that the six research styles (legislative, conservative, liberal, executive, hierarchical, and monarchic) measured by the Research Styles Inventory statistically predicted the seven scales in the PSPCI. These findings enrich the literature on PhD education and provide practical implications for students, supervisors, and programs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Climate change and ocean acidification pose significant challenges to both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, making it critical to understand species’ vulnerability. Phenotypic plasticity and evolutionary adaptation are key mechanisms enabling organisms to cope with environmental shifts, with marine species appearing particularly susceptible. This semi-quantitative bibliometric review, conducted following PRISMA guidelines, examines research on climate change and ocean acidification impacts on marine organisms, focusing on plasticity and adaptation. We analysed 168 peer-reviewed articles published between 1995 and 2024 from Web of Science and Scopus. Publications remained low until 2013, then increased threefold, peaking in 2019, with the US, Australia, and China leading. Research predominantly addressed marine animals, especially fish, bivalves, and other invertebrates. Most studies focused on plasticity (57%) and examined molecular traits as response variables. Temperature, pH, and their combination were the most studied environmental drivers, whereas salinity and dissolved oxygen received little attention. Conceptual ambiguities in the use of plasticity and adaptation were noted. Our review highlights research gaps and emphasizes the need for integrated studies on plasticity and adaptation to better understand marine species’ vulnerability to climate change and ocean acidification and guide effective conservation and management strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Autistic youth are at increased risk for needing emergency services compared to their non-autistic peers. While research has begun to explore the nature of emergency service use in this group, researchers have not yet assessed important individual-, family-, and community-level factors that may be associated with these encounters. This study aimed to address this gap in the field via a mixed methods design by characterizing families of autistic children who have utilized emergency services, examining factors accounting for significant differences in service utilization, and exploring family experiences and satisfaction with emergency service encounters. Method 77 caregivers of autistic individuals who endorsed current child challenging behavior completed measures assessing child, family, and community variables. 38 caregivers had used emergency services in recent years; a subset of caregivers ( n = 8) completed interviews about their experiences with emergency services. Results Bivariate analyses and a multivariate analysis of variance were conducted with individual, family, and community variables to determine group differences for families with and without recent emergency service use. Child psychiatric co-occurring conditions ( F (3, 70) = 17.40, p &lt; .001, partial η 2 = 0.20) and child aggressive behavior ( F (1, 72) = 11.22, p = .001, partial η 2 = 0.14) were significantly associated with emergency service use. In qualitative interviews, caregivers described a range of facilitators and barriers to emergency care. Conclusions These findings shed light on clinical characteristics that may be important for developing prevention efforts and indicate a significant need for broad reform at the intersection of emergency care and autism services.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Cryopreservation is vital for conserving microalgal biodiversity and biotechnological potential, but conventional cryoprotective agents (CPAs) like dimethyl sulfoxide and methanol are often cytotoxic. This study introduces exopolysaccharides (EPS) from the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. ARAS18 as a natural alternative. The strain exhibited a high EPS production yield (90 ± 0.3 mg L −1 ) with a complex anionic structure, characterized by high carbohydrate content (91.8%) and functional groups like uronic acids, which facilitate vitrification and extracellular membrane stabilization. In cryopreservation trials with three Antarctic microalgae ( Nannochloris sp. ASYA12, Chlorella sp. ASYA31, Micractinium simplicissimum ASYA46), 10% EPS consistently yielded high post-thaw viability and growth recovery, outperforming conventional CPAs. Crucially, Trypan Blue staining and microscopy confirmed that EPS preserved full cellular integrity without toxicity, whereas traditional agents caused significant membrane damage. The extracellular mode of action of EPS eliminates the risks of intracellular toxicity and the microbial contamination associated with glycerol. This work establishes Nostoc -derived EPS as a highly effective, biocompatible, and sustainable CPA, offering a robust strategy for the long-term preservation of valuable polar microbiomes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The relationship between relevant logic and mathematical practice has often been twofold: while some relevant logicians have focused on the descriptive project of capturing (in some sense) informal mathematical reasoning better than classical logic does, others have engaged in the normative project of suggesting how mathematics should be done as opposed to how it is done now. Both projects have received heavy criticism. In this paper, I argue that the intuitive idea of variable sharing does point to a real aspect of mainstream mathematical practices, and this fact can be used to make sense of both relevantist projects: on one hand, relevant logics may be used to provide a more accurate model of this particular aspect of current practices, while on the other, they can suggest new practices which deviate from the standard precisely in their approach to variable sharing.",

    "Abstract": "Respiratory rate (RR) is a vital sign often unused in clinical practice due to labour-intensive manual counting or capnography limitations in spontaneously breathing patients. This study validated RespX, a novel accelerometer-based wireless sensor, for continuous respiratory rate measurement in hospitalised patients. This prospective, single-centre observational study included hospitalised adults (> 18 years) expected to remain undisturbed for one hour while measuring RR. The RespX sensor, placed on the left chest wall, was compared with continuous capnography and manual counting every 20 min for one hour. The primary endpoint was respiratory rate measured by RespX within ± 3 breaths per minute compared to capnography. Linear mixed-effects models analyzed mean differences between methods. Twenty-nine patients completed the study. The proportion of RespX measurements within ± 3 breaths per minute of capnography was 77% (95% CI: 74.8-79.0%) for raw data and 82.8% (95% CI: 80.7-84.7%) after removing outliers. The proportion of RespX measurements within ± 3 breaths per minute of manual counting was 87,5% (95% CI: 81,1%-93,8%). For the capnography the proportions for the raw data was 87,8% (95% CI: 81,8-93,8%) and 94,5% (95% CI: 90,3%-98,7%) after removing outliers. Linear mixed-effects analysis showed mean differences of -0.40 (p = 0.43) for raw data and 0.39 (p = 0.15) for filtered data between RespX and capnography, supporting their equivalence. RespX demonstrated lower measurement variability (SD: 0.75-3.05) compared to capnography (SD: 0.99-5.19). No adverse events were observed during the study. The wireless RespX accelerometer-based sensor provides a novel and accurate method for assessing the respiratory rate in awake hospitalised patients compared with capnography.Trial registration: NCT06911541.",

    "Abstract": "The study of breast cancer is complicated by the heterogeneity inherent within the disease. Numerous models have been developed to study the initiation, progression, and treatment of breast cancer. These include carcinogen induced mouse models, genetically engineered mouse models, and patient derived xenografts. The relevance of these mouse models to humans must be precisely defined for appropriate understanding of disease mechanisms to derive intervening treatments. Sequencing projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) and Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) were pivotal developments in understanding driving events in human cancers. These studies have revealed that in addition to activation of strong oncogenes, or loss of tumor suppressors, that secondary events are necessary for tumor development and progression. These techniques should also be applied to mouse models of human breast cancer. For all the available models studied and reviewed here, whole genome sequencing (WGS) in conjunction with gene expression analysis has revealed conserved events between human and mouse model systems. This identification of conserved, critical events driving breast cancer has led to novel targets based on breast cancer subtype, ultimately resulting in new therapeutic opportunities. The combination of sequencing and choice of the appropriate mouse model can provide a powerful tool in developing appropriate pre-clinical models of breast cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The University of Deusto, a Jesuit institution with a long educational tradition, bases its pedagogical model on Ignatian Pedagogy, promoting the comprehensive education of students. Within this framework, transversal learning outcomes occupy a central place, with the hallmark skill being that which develops self-knowledge, ethics, social responsibility, sustainability, and openness to transcendence. This approach seeks to train students who are committed to society and capable of acting with professional excellence and a sense of social justice. In this context, the Faculty of Health Sciences was created in 2020 with the mission of training professionals in Medicine, Nursing, Physiotherapy, and Psychology who not only master technical skills but also essential transversal learning outcomes. To achieve this, priority is given to the application of active learning methodologies such as Problem-Based Learning (PBL), Clinical Scenario-Based Learning (CSBL), and simulation, all of which are aligned with Ignatian Pedagogy. To support this teaching innovation, the Commission on Learning Methodologies in Health Sciences (CoMACS, from the Spanish) was established as a natural evolution of the Medical and Health Education Unit. Its objective is to coordinate the implementation of these methodologies, train faculty, and ensure educational quality. Its achievements include the full implementation of PBL in the Bachelor’s Degree in Medicine, the consolidation of CSBL in the Bachelor’s Degree in Nursing, and the development of simulation programs. This model has strengthened teaching innovation and educational excellence, positioning itself as a benchmark at the University of Deusto.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract It has been demonstrated in multiple randomized trials that the PAX Good Behavior Game is an effective school-based program for reducing the severity and progression of childhood emotional and behavioral problems that are prognostic of mental disorders, personality disorders, and self-harm behavior in adolescence and early adulthood. Embedding effective programs into routine practices of frontline settings is a global priority for mental health prevention, however, little is known about what strategies effectively support program implementation in schools. The purpose of this study was to test the effect of a multicomponent implementation strategy on the adoption and efficacy of the PAX Good Behavior Game, using a cluster randomized controlled trial with a type-3 implementation-effectiveness design. The trial was conducted in 25 primary schools across New South Wales, Australia. Schools were randomly assigned to receive the PAX Good Behavior Game plus an implementation toolkit to support adoption (intervention group) or the PAX Good Behavior Game only (control group). The primary outcome was change in rate of program adoption, measured as current use or support of the PAX Good Behavior Game, first measured at 6 weeks post-registration (T0). The secondary effectiveness measure was change in students’ emotional and behavioral problems, using the teacher-reported Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). The first measure of the SDQ occurred at trial registration, prior to program implementation (T0). Both adoption and effectiveness were re-measured at 6 months post-registration (T1). All data were analyzed using intention-to-treat methods. Early program adoption was higher in the intervention group compared to control group (93.6% vs 45.2%: OR = 21.20, 95% CI [3.50, 128.45], z = 3.32, p &lt; 0.001), with no differential effects at 6 months (96.8% vs 95.7%: OR = 1.21, 95% CI [0.16, 9.04], z = 0.18, p = 0.855). Emotional and behavioral problems reduced in both groups from baseline to 6 months ( p &lt; 0.001, d = − 0.25), with no differential effects observed at T1 ( p = 0.474, d = − 0.08). There was a positive linear relationship between adoption and the perceived acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of the program for the pooled sample. It seems that providing implementation support early in the process of establishing new innovations in schools may help accelerate early adoption by increasing perceived appropriateness and acceptability, but uncertainty remains as to what support is needed to optimize implementation and effectiveness longer term. The protocol was retrospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12621001125819.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Graphs are fundamental structures for representing complex, nonlinear structured data across various domains, including social networks and quantum systems. Quantum graph recurrent neural networks (QGRNNs) have been proposed to model quantum dynamics in graph-based quantum systems, but their applicability to classical data remains an open problem. In this paper, we leverage QGRNNs to process classical graph-structured data. In particular, we demonstrate how QGRNN can reconstruct node features in classical datasets. Our results show that QGRNN achieves high feature reconstruction accuracy, resulting in near-perfect classification. Furthermore, we propose an information hiding technique based on our QGRNN, where messages are embedded into a graph and then retrieved under certain conditions. We assess retrieval accuracy for different dictionary sizes and message lengths, showing that QGRNN maintains high retrieval accuracy, with minor degradation as complexity increases. These findings demonstrate the scalability and robustness of QGRNNs for both classical data processing and secure information hiding, paving the way toward quantum-enhanced feature extraction, privacy-preserving computations, and quantum steganography.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The present study investigates the mechanism by which the thermodynamically stable form of carbamazepine, CBZ(III), transforms to the trigonal polymorph, CBZ(II), during ball milling in the presence of palmitic acid. Crystal-structure and lattice-energy analyses were performed, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided insight into crystal-surface and molecular-level phenomena underpinning the phase transformation. The PIXEL formalism and the all-atom Coulomb–London–Pauli method reproduced the experimentally observed stability order between CBZ(III) and CBZ(II). MD indicates limited miscibility between CBZ and palmitic acid—both at crystal surfaces and in the melt. The transformation proceeds via surface fluidization of CBZ(III) and hydrophobic-interaction–driven aggregation of CBZ around palmitic-acid alkyl chains. MD of palmitic-acid inclusion in CBZ(II) channels, together with pore analyses, suggests that stable inclusion would require lattice dilation. Trajectory inspection further shows frequent guest–wall repulsive contacts that can expel palmitic acid from the voids. Further work is warranted to test whether the transformation mechanism proposed for the polymorphic transformation of CBZ(III)→CBZ(II) generalizes to other mechanically induced solid-state transformations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Algae are used intensively in bioremediation studies due to their cell structure organization, doubling their weight in one day, ease of application in biotechnological processes, low cost, content of many useful substances, ability to remove some harmful substances from the environment, and resistance to environmental factors. In this work, Spirogyra sp . was isolated from freshwater sources in Ankara, and the cultivated algal biomass was entrapped in magnetic alginate beads (MA@ALG). The MA@ALG beads were used for the biosorption and degradation of three different endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), namely Bisphenol A (BPA), Diclofenac (DCF), and Congo red (CR), using free algal biomass as a control system. The biosorption capacities of the free algal biomass for BPA, CR and DCF were 89.4, 163.1, and 68.2 mg/g, respectively. Whereas the biosorption capacities of MA@ALG for BPA, DCF, and CR were 73.6, 104.4, and 49.5 mg/g, respectively. The presence of laccase-like activity of the Spirogyra sp . in the cell-free medium was assayed after contact with the EDCs. The degradation efficiencies of BPA, CR, and DCF were 79.7, 88.2, and 81.7% by the free algal biomass, and 68.9, 73.3, and 73.4% for MA@ALG, respectively, in a batch reactor for 7 days. Biosorption of BPA, DCF, and CR on the free algal biomass and MA@ALG is described by the Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second order kinetic model. The toxicities of the tested compounds and degradation products were assessed with Daphnia magna , Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , and Triticum aestivum L . The degradation products of BPA, DCF, and CR had no remarkable toxic effect on the test organisms used compared to the parent compounds.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Rinck hockey has been shown to be a highly demanding team sport with serious gaps between training and competitions. This study examined elite male rink hockey players’ training and competition variation demands, considering player positions. Methods Ten participants from a leading European team underwent data collection during two microcycles using a local positioning system and heart-rate monitoring. A linear mixed model, accounting for individual repeated measures, was used to compare physiological and mechanical load demands between player positions across training days and competition. Results Regarding physiological metrics, forward players showed lower total distance skated (m) on match-day-4 and match-day-2 when compared to match-day ( p &lt; 0.001) and lower maximum heart rate (bpm) on match-day-4 and match-day-3 than on match-day-2 and match-day ( p &lt; 0.001). Regarding biomechanical metrics, forwards presented lower ( p &lt; 0.001) accelerations, decelerations, and high-intense impacts across the training sessions when compared with match-day ( p &lt; 0.001). Defenders/midfielder players also experienced significantly lower high-intensity impacts than match-day ( p &lt; 0.001). Cluster analysis classified physiological and biomechanical demands into \"Low\" and \"High\" categories between training days and competition. Results highlighted the inadequacy of training sessions replicating game demands for defenders/midfielders and forwards. Conclusions The proposed approach allows for categorizing and classifying physiological and biomechanical loads in rink hockey, assisting coaches in customizing training sessions, and emphasizing the importance of position-specific modifications in elite rink hockey training.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We introduce a brain-constrained neurocomputational model designed to simulate higher cognitive functions of the human brain, implemented using NEST, a widely used open-source simulator optimised for high-performance spiking neural network simulations. Previously implemented in the custom-built C-based Felix simulation library, transitioning the model to NEST enhances accessibility, reproducibility, and computational efficiency. At the cellular level, the model comprises spiking excitatory neurons and local inhibitory neurons, whereas at the network level, it replicates the structural and functional organisation of 12 cortical regions spanning frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, along with their associated inter-area connectivity. Additionally, global inhibition mechanisms and neuronal noise are integrated. Learning in the model follows biologically plausible Hebbian plasticity principles, incorporating both long-term potentiation and long-term depression. To validate the NEST implementation, we replicated previous simulation findings obtained with the Felix-based model. The new implementation successfully reproduced the same topographical distribution of cell assemblies following associative learning of object and action words within action and perception systems, replicating a range of previous neuroimaging results. Although the NEST model produced larger cell assemblies than Felix, the overall topographical patterns remained similar, indicating preservation of fundamental network characteristics. Moreover, the transition to NEST significantly enhanced computational efficiency, reducing simulation runtime nearly sixfold compared to Felix. This improvement in computational speed is crucial for expanding the model to include additional cortical regions, such as extending to the right hemisphere, which necessitates increased computational resources.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The edible flowers of Clitoria ternatea and Malvaviscus arboreus , cultivated under agroecological principles, represent promising sources of functional ingredients. This study evaluated their convective drying behavior (50–80 °C), powder morphology, and technofunctional properties. The experiments involved convective drying under controlled airflow, with moisture ratio data fitted to mathematical models. The Page model provided the best fit (R² &gt;0.99). Thermodynamic parameters were determined to assess the energy nature of moisture diffusion, while scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterized powder microstructure. Multivariate analysis (PCA) was applied to differentiate samples based on their physical and functional traits. M. arboreus required longer drying times (150–840 min) and exhibited higher activation energy (57,753 J mol⁻¹) than C. ternatea (44,806 J mol⁻¹), indicating greater resistance to moisture transfer. Both processes were endothermic (ΔH &gt; 0) and non-spontaneous (ΔG &gt; 0). Microstructural analysis by scanning electron microscopy showed clear differences between the species. C. ternatea powders exhibited higher solubility (12.8%) and better flowability, making them suitable for instant food applications, while M. arboreus powders showed greater cohesiveness, suggesting use in structured formulations. Multivariate analysis (PCA) effectively distinguished the two species based on their physical and thermodynamic profiles. These findings demonstrate that C. ternatea holds stronger potential for functional powder production, whereas M. arboreus requires further process optimization. This work highlights the value of agroecological edible flowers as sustainable ingredients with distinct technological functionalities.",

Tea infusions were prepared using US treatment at two temperatures (45 °C and 90 °C) and compared with conventionally brewed samples. Antioxidant capacity was evaluated via cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays, along with total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC). Results showed that antioxidant activity and bioactive compound levels varied significantly with tea type and brewing temperature. Matcha brewed at higher temperature consistently exhibited the strongest antioxidant responses across the assays, whereas black tea showed comparatively lower activity. Black teas showed the lowest activity across all parameters. Antibacterial evaluations revealed that US-assisted teas, particularly high-temperature matcha and green tea infusions, demonstrated pronounced inhibitory effects against E. coli , with matcha also exhibiting notable activity against S. typhimurium . US-assisted brewing, especially at high temperatures, enhanced the extraction of bioactive compounds and improved the antimicrobial efficacy of tea infusions. Graphical abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing (WAAM) utilises the process of arc welding for the additive manufacturing of components and is suitable for functionally graded additive manufacturing. The aim of the present study is to illustrate the possibility of systematically generating pores in additively manufactured AlSi10Mg components when customised shielding gas conditions are used. For this purpose, Gas Metal Arc Welding-WAAM was used with variation of shielding gas composition and shielding gas quantity to produce vertical multilayer walls consisting of AlSi10Mg. Micrographs revealed the well-known Al matrix with Al-Si eutectic and statistical analysis showed strong influence of shielding gas composition on porosity, number of pores and pore diameter. Using N 2 + 10 vol% H 2 as shielding gas increased the porosity and pore diameter significantly while using Ar or Ar + 10 vol% H 2 led to smaller pores which, however, are present in larger numbers. Varying the amount of the respective shielding gas between 3 Nl/min, 12 Nl/min, 18 Nl/min and 30 Nl/min had only a minor influence on porosity, number of pores and pore diameter. However, the usage of 3 Nl/min led to higher porosity when Ar shielding gas was used and to less porosity and pore diameter when N2 + 10 vol% H2 was used. Finally, when Ar + 10 vol% H2 was used, the parameter set with 3 Nl/min was not suitable for the manufacturing of a wall with WAAM. The use of the N 2 -H 2 gas mixture appears to be a promising approach for manufacturing of continuously porous structures whereby nitride precipitates appear to stabilise the pores during remelting. However, as only few samples were tested, a stable process window has not been established yet.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This research demonstrates the impact of unconditional business-to-consumer (B2C) gifts. It contributes to the literature by examining how an unconditional gift at the beginning of a shopping experience can influence both loyalty and transactional spending. The findings show that an unconditional gift creates feelings of gratitude, driving loyalty and transactional spending. At the same time, receiving such a gift can lead to a sense of obligation, prompting increased transactional spending to alleviate this feeling. To address the identified gaps in research on B2C gift giving and provide managers a clear path to successfully launch an unconditional gift-giving program, we conduct two firm-partnered field experiments, tracking the behaviors of customers after receipt of an unconditional gift. We then conduct five experimental studies to validate the theoretical process and examine three managerially relevant contingencies: value of the gift, new versus existing customers, and a promotional reward versus an unconditional gift. We find that even unconditional gifts with little monetary value provide benefits for a firm and the effects are robust across new and existing customers. Furthermore, we find that unconditional gifts create greater feelings of obligation than promotional rewards. Managers can use our findings to design unconditional gift-giving programs regarding when, what, and how unconditional gifts should be given to have the largest impact on customers.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose To identify and evaluate consumer-informed strategies that online exercise leaders can use to enhance engagement in online exercise classes for people living with cancer, using social identity leadership theory as a guiding framework. Method We used a participatory design involving adults with a history of blood cancer. Fourteen participants attended online co-design workshops to generate strategies that online exercise leaders could use to demonstrate their engagement in the four aspects of social identity leadership. Twenty-nine unique strategies were identified and thematically grouped using both social identity leadership theory and inductive analysis. These strategies were then rated by 18 participants on their potential to enhance commitment and appeal (0–100 scales). Results Strategies were categorised into four domains-The SIGN Framework: Social support and connection, Individualisation and inclusion, Goals, monitoring and feedback, and Novelty. The highest-rated strategies primarily fell within the Individualisation and inclusion and Goals, monitoring and feedbac k domains, including tailoring exercises, setting personalised goals, adapting sessions based on well-being, and providing regular feedback. These behaviours aligned with the social identity leadership process Identity advancement, whereby leaders act in the group’s interest by supporting group members’ needs and progress. Qualitative findings highlighted that leaders who validate individuals’ needs and preferences strengthen their sense of inclusion and group belonging. Strategies involving Social support and connection (e.g., establishing group rules) and Novelty (e.g., weekly themes) were appreciated by some participants but received more mixed ratings. Conclusion Online exercise leaders who act in the group’s interest and offer personalised support may enhance engagement and group identification among cancer survivors. The SIGN framework offers a practical guide for translating social identity leadership into online exercise settings. Implications for cancer survivors Supporting exercise leaders to apply social identity leadership strategies may increase motivation, connection, and long-term participation in online programs for cancer survivors.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are highly valuable for their potential in cell therapy and tissue engineering because of their self-renewal, multilineage differentiation, and immunomodulatory capabilities. Adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) are advantageous in regenerative medicine because of their accessibility and ease of isolation. However, the clinical application of MSCs faces challenges related to large-scale culture (LSC) expansion, which is required to generate enough cells for transplantation but also decreases their therapeutic properties. This review assesses the impact of LSC on MSC functionality, differentiation potential, and immunomodulatory properties, and identifies key factors, such as metabolic shifts, genetic instability, and altered secretory profiles, that can compromise their therapeutic potential. We explored how prolonged in vitro passaging decreases MSC functionality and increases the risk of genetic alterations. In addition, strategies to preserve the efficacy of MSCs during scaling are discussed. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed, focusing on in vitro and in vivo studies that evaluated the effects of LSC on MSCs. These findings provide insights into optimizing culture protocols to maintain the clinical efficacy of AD-MSCs in regenerative therapies, addressing the critical need to balance large-scale expansion and functional integrity.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Gun violence has led many police agencies to adopt acoustic gunshot detection technology (GDT) to identify gunshots and provide precise locations for rapid police response. Theoretically, GDT could reduce crime through incapacitation and/or deterrence. However, high costs and concerns about effectiveness have led some communities to discontinue its use. Despite growing policy interest, few studies have directly examined GDTs impact on crime. Only 14 such studies were identified in this systematic review, examining the impact of GDT on a range of crime types. A multilevel random effects meta-analysis was conducted of 44 effect sizes from 8 studies with sufficient information. The pooled effect size indicates no significant relationship between GDT and crime (RIRR=1.02; 95% CI [0.90, 1.16]). Moderator analyses using multilevel meta-regression models indicated that neither crime type nor study strength influenced the effects. Substantial between-study heterogeneity was observed, possibly due to inconsistent implementation across jurisdictions. Our findings suggest that while GDT might increase intermediary outcomes like evidence and arrests, it will not reduce crime on its own. Policymakers should consider how technologies like GDT could support other crime reduction efforts. A strategic crime control approach to GDT, including problem analysis, evidence-based responses, partnerships, strategic planning, and built-in accountability mechanisms, is discussed. Achieving GDT-facilitated incapacitation or deterrence requires a comprehensive approach to integrating GDT into organizational practices.",

    "Abstract": "Summary Planchonella is the largest genus in subfamily Chrysophylloideae (Sapotaceae) and includes 97 described species distributed from the Seychelles to Hawaii with the greatest species diversity in Australia, New Caledonia and New Guinea. There are approximately an additional ten taxa that do not easily conform with known species limits, and/or have been identified by molecular methods as new to science. We describe here four new species, P. cerebrifructa Swenson from Borneo and P. hispida Swenson, P. surculiflora Swenson and P. takeuchii Swenson from New Guinea, all with distinctive autapomorphic characters. Planchonella cerebrifructa is readily distinguished by its velvety, wrinkled young fruit, very similar to the complex, folded appearance of a brain’s surface. Planchonella hispida has hispid indumentum of long, Y-shaped trichomes, in decreasing density along the midrib and on the secondary, tertiary and quaternary venation. Planchonella surculiflora sets inflorescences on lateral shoots, often with one or two leaves borne between the villose flowers. Finally, Planchonella takeuchii , although the flowers are unknown, can be recognised by its characteristic glabrous foliage of broadly elliptic leaves with a tapering apex, short petioles (± 5 mm long) and tertiary leaf venation perpendicular to the primary and secondary veins. Now, with the description of these four species, the genus Planchonella includes 101 described species.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Multi-agent artificial intelligence (MAAI) represents a foundational shift in the automation of knowledge work, moving beyond static workflows toward adaptive systems of interacting AI-based agents. These agents perceive, reason, and coordinate in real time to address complex, context-rich tasks that traditionally require human expertise. Drawing on the conceptual roots of process automation, agentic information systems, and AI, this paper introduces a structured, five-component framework that conceptualizes MAAI as a layered architecture composed of foundation model, data-centric perception and action, dynamic orchestration, agent-integrated workflow, and interaction interface. This framework disentangles the technical, organizational, and human-facing dimensions of MAAI, offering researchers and practitioners a systematic lens to analyze and design agent-based AI automation. The framework further structures three research pathways focused on advancing technical capabilities, enabling organizational integration, and addressing socio-technical implications such as fairness, accountability, and labor transformation. Together, these contributions establish a foundation for interdisciplinary inquiry into how MAAI reshapes work, coordination, and digital value creation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The study aims to characterize the secretion dynamics of glucagon-related peptides, including GLP-1, GIP, and GLP-2, across different stages of metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), while evaluating the impact of type 2 diabetes (T2D) on these hormonal responses. Thirty-four MASLD subjects were stratified according with the liver transient elastography (TE ≥ 9 kPa) and T2D in NF (no fibrosis, without T2D; n = 12), NFD (no fibrosis, with T2D; n = 8), F (fibrosis, without T2D; n = 5), and FD (fibrosis, with T2D; n = 9) and completed a standardized 3-h meal tolerance test (MTT). The presence of liver fibrosis, regardless of diabetes status, was associated with hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and greater insulin resistance compared to the non-fibrosis (NF) group. Significant differences in glucagon and GLP-1 response curves were observed across groups. People with T2D showed an elevated peak of glucagon and increased glucagon exposure, as indicated by both the 60-min area under the curve (AUC60’) and total AUC during the MTT. In the FD group, fasting and peak GLP-1 levels, as well as AUC60’ and total AUC GLP-1, were 1.9-, 1.8-, and 1.9-fold higher, respectively, compared to the NF group. GIP responses were similar across groups, except for elevated fasting levels in NFD ( p = 0.002). GLP-2 mirrored GLP-1, with FD showing the highest fasting and postprandial levels. Stepwise regression identified fibrosis and FPG as the main predictors of GLP-1, while glucagon was linked to FPG, HbA1c, and BMI. Liver fibrosis and T2D impact glucagon-related peptides responses in MASLD, revealing important metabolic alterations that may guide therapeutic approaches.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract It is common to find in the literature on natural language semantics reference to the “Frege-Strawson” theory of presuppositions and the “Frege-Strawson” theory of definite descriptions. While these labels might be useful in certain contexts, I argue that the differences between the Fregean and the Strawsonian theories of presupposition are sufficiently important to warrant separate treatment. In the first part of the paper, I consider Frege’s and Strawson’s views on presuppositions, focusing on those triggered by definite descriptions. Next, I propose a formulation of the two theories within a framework for natural language semantics inspired in Kaplan (1989), to which a Montague-style apparatus for semantic composition is added. I argue that Frege’s and Strawson’s respective views of presuppositions should be formally implemented as partial functions situated at different levels within this semantic framework. This offers good reasons for a negative answer to the question in the title. In the second part of the paper, I compare the predictions the two theories make for the case of definite descriptions. I argue that embeddings of definite descriptions in intensional contexts show that the Fregean theory is the more promising alternative for the presuppositions that these expressions trigger.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Subjective text classification tasks, such as abuse detection and stance analysis, often suffer from high levels of annotator disagreement. Conventional approaches typically collapse these disagreements into a single ground truth, thereby discarding valuable supervision signals. We propose MO-WEL (Multi-Objective Weighted Ensemble Learning), a novel framework that explicitly leverages annotator disagreement by jointly optimising ensemble weights and size under multiple objectives. Candidate predictors are trained on diverse label projections obtained through random sampling or annotator-specific selection, and ensemble weights are optimised with respect to three complementary losses: F1 score, cross-entropy and Manhattan distance, alongside a regularisation term. Experiments on four benchmark datasets (ConvAbuse, HS-Brexit, MD-Agreement and ArMIS) show that MO-WEL consistently outperforms strong baselines in accuracy, calibration, and distributional alignment. A case study further demonstrates that MO-WEL produces predictions that balance majority correctness with minority annotator perspectives, yielding interpretable and reliable outputs. Our findings highlight the importance of modelling annotator diversity and suggest ensemble optimisation as a principled means of incorporating disagreement into subjective NLP tasks.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract During World War II, Polish physicians Eugeniusz Łazowski and Stanisław Matulewicz fabricated a typhus epidemic, which they reported in detail only after the war. They injected inactivated Proteus bacteria to patients suffering from mild, flu-like ailments in order to trigger a positive Weil–Felix reaction in their serum, the standard diagnostic tool for typhus at that time. These falsely labelled typhus patients would then be protected from seizure by German occupiers, who were much concerned about transmission of this highly deadly disease. According to Łazowski and Matulewicz, this action saved many Poles from forced labour and other atrocities. We here show that this false epidemic was possible with the simple means available at that time, and that it is plausible from a medical and a historical perspective. How the two doctors combined medical textbook knowledge, social responsibility, epidemiological know-how and ingenuity under war conditions is outstanding. They should serve as role models for humanity and resistance under oppressive systems for present and future generations of physicians.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Increasing evidence suggests a role of 11-oxygenated adrenal androgens (11-OxyA) (11-ketotestosterone, 11KT; 11β-hydroxytestosterone, 11OHT; 11-ketoandrostenedione, 11KA4; 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, 11OHA4) in several hyperandrogenic disorders. This study aimed to describe distributions of 11-OxyA in a healthy young adult population and explore the relation between hormonal contraceptives and 11-OxyA. Methods This study utilized cross-sectional data from the third Fit Futures Study conducted in Norway. 11-OxyA in fasting blood samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry technique (LC-MS/MS). Contraceptive use was registered and categorized as combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC) or gestagen-only contraceptives. Descriptive statistics were used to report 11-OxyA distributions. Independent t-tests and ANOVA were used to compare biomarker concentrations between groups. Results The study included 289 males and 337 females with median age of 27 years. Males had 9–30% higher 11-OxyA concentrations than females (all p’s &lt; 0.01). Among the females, 25.5% used CHC, 36.7% used gestagen-only contraceptives, and 37.8% used non-hormonal contraceptives or no contraceptives. As concentrations of 11-OxyA in gestagen-only contraceptives users were similar to non-users, these groups were combined. CHC users had 25–29% lower concentrations of 11KT, 11OHT, and 11KA4 than non-CHC users (all p’s &lt; 0.001). After exclusion of CHC users, sex differences attenuated and was no longer significant for 11KT. Conclusion Females had lower concentrations of 11-OxyA than males, partly explained by use of CHC, as users had significantly lower concentrations of 11-OxyA than non-CHC users, except 11OHA4. These findings suggest an additional mechanism for CHC in treatment of hyperandrogenic conditions, in which 11-OxyA are elevated.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Optical switching of ferroelectric polarization is of interest for wireless and energy-efficient control of logic states. So far, this phenomenon has been widely demonstrated only in ferroelectric perovskites, while studies on other emerging ferroelectrics remain limited. In this regard, the paradigmatic example of a technologically relevant ferroelectric material is HfO 2 . However, HfO 2 has a very wide bandgap, limiting light absorption. So far, the proposed strategies to enhance light absorption in HfO 2 -based systems are detrimental to ferroelectric properties, i.e., bandgap lowering or on-purpose defect introduction, which reduce switchable polarization and increase the presence of leakage currents. Here, we show that good ferroelectric properties, i.e., sizeable polarization (up to 15 μC cm −2 ), low leakage current (under 10 –6 A cm −2 ), high endurance (up to 10 8 cycles) and fast switching (&lt; 50 ns), can be achieved in epitaxial Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 films through an alternative strategy, BaTiO 3 capping. While ferroelectric properties are remarkable, we demonstrate that the presence of BaTiO 3 allows light absorption and the concomitant electric field generation, as supported by density functional theory calculations, which enables optical switching of polarization in Hf 0.5 Zr 0.5 O 2 under 405 nm illumination. It is observed that optical switching is more efficient in films with thicker BaTiO 3 capping layer. The high polarizability of BaTiO 3 contributes to minimizing degradation in the ferroelectric response of the system. The results presented here indicate that appropriate designs can be followed to obtain optical switching of polarization in ferroelectric HfO 2 while preserving main functional properties.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Current accident statistics show that the highest rate of fatal traffic accidents in Germany occurs on rural roads, particularly as a result of vehicles leaving the road. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and highly automated driving functions therefore have high potential to improve safety in this domain. A key challenge is lateral vehicle control, especially the selection of an appropriate trajectory when cornering in automated driving mode (SAE Level 3+). The aim of this work is to derive characteristic driving variants from real-world measurement data, which serve as a basis for the design of automated lateral vehicle control and contribute to achieving high customer acceptance at the same time. For this purpose, extensive data from real world field tests was collected, standardized, and segmented at defined nodes (curve entry, apex, curve exit). A subsequent cluster analysis identified typical driving styles. Based on this, various trajectory variants were systematically generated using graph theory methods. These variants differ in terms of vehicle class, curve radius, and preference for corner-cutting. In addition, environmental influences such as the presence of oncoming traffic were considered. The outcome is a catalog of reality-based trajectories that serves as the basis for future driving functions. This enables further investigations in which the influence of the variants on driving comfort and safety will be evaluated, both in the Dynamic Vehicle Road Simulator (DVRS) and in real-world driving tests with test vehicles.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Modeling the initial development stage helps assess climate change impacts and species vulnerability under future scenarios. This study calibrated and validated two development models - the Phyllochron (Phyl) and Wang and Engel (WE) - under field conditions and identified potential alterations in the development of Brazilian forest species ( Bauhinia forficata , Ceiba speciosa , Handroanthus chrysotrichus , Handroanthus impetiginosus , and Tabebuia roseoalba ) throughout the 21st century. The Phyl and WE models estimate daily leaf appearance, which, when integrated over time, provides the duration of initial development. Field experiments conducted between 2022 and 2024 supported model calibration and validation. The best-performing model was applied to simulate development under current (1995–2014) and three future periods (2041–2060, 2061–2080, and 2081–2100) and three socioeconomic scenarios (SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). Sixteen General Circulation Models from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6) were used. Both models accurately estimated leaf number for all species, with lower precision for development duration. The Phyl model performed better for C. speciosa (RMSE = 1.30 leaves, 29.8 days) and H. chrysotrichus (1.41 leaves, 23.0 days), while the WE model performed better for B. forficata (1.14 leaves, 11.9 days), H. impetiginosus (1.50 leaves, 32.3 days), and T. roseoalba (1.32 leaves, 25.2 days). Projected temperature increases (+ 1.3 to + 4.5 °C) will alter leaf emergence and development duration, with reductions (− 1 to − 55 days) for sowing from February to July and increases (+ 1 to + 24 days) from August to January. Adjusting sowing schedules and controlling seedling environments are key adaptation strategies under global warming. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Sphingolipids are not only essential structural components of cellular membranes but also key signaling molecules that regulate plant growth, development, and stress responses. However, their specific roles in root development remain largely unknown. In the presented study, we demonstrate that overexpression of the GhGCS1 gene significantly enhances lateral root development in cotton. Integrated comprehensive transcriptome analysis and phytohormone quantification revealed that GhGCS1 promotes lateral root initiation and elongation primarily by suppressing cytokinin biosynthesis. Notably, GhGCS1 overexpression also markedly improved cotton resistance to Verticillium dahliae . Further molecular analyses indicated that GhGCS1 enhances cotton verticillium wilt resistance through modulation of the expression of sphingolipid-associated brassinosteroid- and pathogenesis-related genes. Collectively, these findings reveal a dual regulatory role for GhGCS1 in coordinating root architecture and immune responses in cotton, providing novel insights and potential strategies for developing crop varieties with improved yield potential and stress tolerance.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Supportive care in cancer (SCC), which encompasses the management of symptoms and treatment-related adverse effects, as well as the promotion of physical and psychological well-being throughout the whole course of treatment into follow-up of survivors, can significantly improve the quality of life and clinical outcomes of cancer patients. Over the past decade, substantial progress has been achieved in SCC-related clinical research globally. However, development and implementation of SCC in China still face considerable challenges, largely attributable to regional disparities in medical resources, limited financial support, and sociocultural factors. This comprehensive review delineates the current state of SCC in China based on a nationwide cross-sectional survey, highlighting the unmet needs of cancer patients, survivors, and healthcare providers. Key issues included insufficient social and financial support, suboptimal symptom management, inadequate patient education, and limited use of electronic patient-reported outcomes (ePROs). These findings underscore an urgent need to develop standardized protocols, enhance multidisciplinary collaboration, and promote digital health tools to improve the application and quality of SCC in China.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Black patients in the US are disproportionately affected by lung cancer. National surveys evidence that black patients and their families are less satisfied with the quality of palliative care received. This necessitates investigating the impact and outcome of its use for minority patients. Methods This retrospective study included patients treated for lung cancer at a single academic center between 2012–2022. Demographics, insurance status, comorbidities, treatment strategies, and cancer survival outcomes were analyzed. Results Altogether 2,048 (1,660 white and 388 black) patients were included in the study with other races excluded due to low sample sizes. Black patients were younger, more male, had higher rates of current tobacco use, and utilized Medicaid more often than their white counterparts. Black patients also had more comorbidities while having less family history of cancer, were diagnosed with more advanced stages of cancer, and had more active cancer status in follow-up. They also received palliative care at almost twice the rate of white patients. While black patients had significantly poorer survival overall ( p = 0.007), race was insignificant in a multivariable analysis ( p = 0.240). However, factors such as insurance, type of cancer, type of care received, and cancer stage were found to be significant predictors of death. Conclusion While overall survival seemed poorer for black patients, race was not a predictor of mortality in multivariable analysis. Encouragingly, black patients received palliative care at almost twice the rate of white patients. Further research is needed to ensure comprehensive screening for early diagnosis in minority patients.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Improving total factor productivity (TFP) in agriculture is a crucial pathway to sustaining agricultural output growth in developing countries. The rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICT) has created new opportunities for enhancing agricultural efficiency. Based on survey data from 5,048 farm households in Jiangsu Province collected in 2020 and 2021, this study employs a Tobit model to empirically examine the impact of ICT adoption on agricultural efficiency. The results demonstrate that: (1) ICT adoption exerts a significant positive influence on the TFP of farm households; (2) ICT adoption stimulates land input, increases yield per unit area, and promotes total output, economic output, and labor productivity; (3) The mechanism analysis further reveals that ICT improves farmers’ understanding of credit and encourages participation in agricultural insurance, which strengthens their ability to manage risk and enhances production efficiency; and (4) Agricultural technology training and intensive farming practices both contribute significantly to higher levels of agricultural production efficiency. These findings suggest that expanding the use and application of ICT is vital for improving agricultural efficiency and advancing the development of the agricultural economy in the digital era.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Transverse cracking is a major distress mechanism in Continuously Reinforced Concrete Pavement (CRCP), affecting ride smoothness, service life, and maintenance strategies. This research introduces a hybrid predictive framework that couples Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) to enhance the accuracy of transverse crack prediction in CRCP. The analysis utilized 395 records from 33 pavement sections obtained from the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) program, encompassing structural, environmental, traffic, and performance-related parameters. PSO was applied to fine-tune critical GBM hyperparameters, namely the number of iterations, learning rate, and tree depth. The optimized PSO–GBM model demonstrated excellent performance, yielding an average RMSE of 1.62 and an R 2 of 0.99 under 5-fold cross-validation, surpassing benchmark models such as conventional GBM, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Linear Regression. Sensitivity analysis revealed that L3 thickness, L4 thickness, and Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) were the most significant contributors, consistent with engineering knowledge of crack development. Validation through residual distribution and equality line plots confirmed the robustness and stability of the proposed approach across varying severity levels.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In this study, antioxidant peptides were isolated and purified from Tongchuan Douchi through ultrafiltration and gel chromatography. To further assess the in vivo antioxidant activity of the fraction (F3) which had a high DPPH radical scavenging rate, 60 male mice were randomly divided into 6 groups (normal, positive control, model group, and low-, medium-, and high-dose group), and immunosuppression was induced via intraperitoneal cyclophosphamide injection. Hepatorenal function was evaluated by determining organ coefficients and oxidative stress markers including total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The results showed that 10 peptides (LLLPH, KDFPPR, DDFFL, ADFYNPK, IIGGI, DTPMIG, SVVDM, LVSPP, C(+57.02)ADLF, and VIVEL) which are rich in hydrophobic amino acids were identified in the fraction F3 by LC-MS/MS. The quantitative analysis of the animal experiments demonstrated that administration of medium and high doses of the F3 fraction significantly ( P &lt; 0.05) improved the liver, kidney, and spleen coefficients in immunosuppressed mice compared to the model group. The high-dose F3 administration significantly increased the SOD and GSH-Px activities while reducing the MDA levels in both hepatic and renal tissues of mice. These results revealed that Douchi-derived peptides can mediate antioxidant effects in vivo by both scavenging free radicals and activating endogenous antioxidant enzymes.",

    "Abstract": "A thermotolerant, odor-suppressing microbial agent was inoculated into food-waste (FW) composting to systematically evaluate its influence on odorants, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), microbial community structure, extracellular enzyme activities, and the transcriptional profile of nitrogen- and sulfur-cycle genes. Compared with the uninoculated control, cumulative emissions of NH<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S, ethanol, and acetaldehyde declined by 73.45%, 65.30%, 40.22%, and 37.20%, respectively, in the bio-augmented reactor. NH<sub>3</sub> High-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the inoculation enhanced the microbial richness and diversity, while increasing the abundance of thermophilic strains that promote compost maturation and reduce nitrogen loss. Concomitantly, the relative abundances of acid-producing and skatole-generating populations were suppressed. Quantitative PCR showed that the expression of narG, norB, nif, nrfA, nirB, aprA, and sat genes was down-regulated. This consequently reduced the production of NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>-N and inhibited the sulfate reduction process, thereby coordinating nitrogen and sulfur metabolic transformations and significantly lowering NH<sub>3</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>S emissions. Overall, this study demonstrates the feasibility of microbial inoculation for mitigating odor emissions, retaining nutrients, and accelerating compost maturation, while providing mechanistic insights into how microbial formulations regulate enzyme activities and the expression of functional genes during composting.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We consider a highly generalized set-up in which each vertex of the infinite two-dimensional square lattice graph (whose set of vertices is $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ , with each vertex ( x , y ) adjacent to each of $(x+1,y)$ and $(x,y+1)$ ) is assigned, independent of all else, a label that reads trap with probability p , target with probability q , and open with the remaining probability $(1-p-q)$ , and, in addition, each edge is assigned, independent of all else, a label that reads trap with probability r and open with probability $(1-r)$ . This model encompasses the seemingly more general model where, in addition to all the vertex-labels and edge-labels described above, an edge can also be labeled as a target , since assigning the label of target to an edge going from ( x , y ) to either $(x+1,y)$ or $(x,y+1)$ is equivalent to marking the vertex ( x , y ) as a trap. A percolation game is played on this random board, involving two players and a token. The players take turns to make moves , where a move involves relocating the token from where it is currently located, say some vertex $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$ , to any one of $(x+1,y)$ and $(x,y+1)$ . A player wins if she is able to move the token to a vertex labeled as a target, or force her opponent to either move the token to a vertex labeled as a trap or along an edge labeled as a trap. We seek to find a regime , in terms of values of the parameters p , q , and r , in which the probability of this game resulting in a draw equals 0. We further consider special cases of this game, such as when each edge is assigned, independently, a label that reads trap with probability r , target with probability s , and open with probability $(1-r-s)$ , but the vertices are left unlabeled, and various regimes of values of r and s are explored in which the probability of draw is guaranteed to be 0. We show that the probability of draw in each such game equals 0 if and only if a suitably defined probabilistic cellular automaton (PCA) is ergodic , following which we implement the technique of weight functions or potential functions to investigate the regimes in which said PCA is ergodic. We mention here that one of the main results of Holroyd et al. (2019 Probab. Theory Related Fields 174, 1187–1217) follows as a special case of our main result. Moreover, our result shows that a phase transition happens at the origin (i.e. at $(p,q,r)=(0,0,0)$ in the case of",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Washington’s leverage over political and military actors in post-Bashir Sudan has been limited. There is little agreement on whether this results from changing international and regional geopolitics, America’s foreign policy priorities and its miscalculations, or a combination of all these factors. Moving beyond these explanations, I argue that the US approach remained deeply shaped by long-standing dilemmas in its democracy promotion doctrine, bureaucratic dynamics, and the decline in domestic advocacy. Understanding these variables contributes to broader debates on US Africa policy and to democracy promotion scholarship by foregrounding domestic drivers and the limits of external support for democratic transitions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Captivity is a complex phenomenon in international politics with a broad range of purposes, functions, and consequences. Existing scholarship suggests that states use captivity, for example, to facilitate hostage or prisoner exchanges, to extract material rewards, or, in the case of human shields, for deterrence purposes. This article argues that states may use captivity to deter not only traditional military threats emanating from other states, but also perceived threats to regime security posed by non-state actors, including individuals, and that emotions are central to this process. The argument is illustrated through three empirical vignettes that show how the Chinese government has detained foreign academics, publishers, and NGO workers engaged in activities seen as threatening regime security. Detention is interpreted as attempts to deter such actors. While fear is often seen as key to successful deterrence, the article indicates that paying attention to other emotions can help better understand deterrence failure. Specifically, because captivity, and deterrence, involve the denial of the captive’s agency and may trigger feelings of humiliation and shame, it can backfire as the target of deterrence efforts might seek to act to regain agency.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Critical thinking is supported by a rich and diverse literature, with particularly close ties to argumentation theory and informal logic. It has often been presented in terms of a set of skills and dispositions, with the latter exemplified through the figure of an ideal critical thinker. These accounts of the relevant dispositions are intuitive and tend to emphasize openness, clarity, and a concern for truth. Seemingly running against this impression, it is argued here that an ideal critical thinker can willfully engage in fallacious argumentation. This surprising possibility is grounded in the distinction between thinking and arguing, with the literature on critical thinking being implicitly and rightly limited to the former. The argument draws on an established account of critical thinking dispositions, a simple supporting view of the nature of dispositions, and analogies to familiar phenomena like lying. The result complements existing work on the subject in terms of what a critical thinker should do, contributing to our understanding of the conceptual boundaries of critical thinking and argumentation proper.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel entailed a disproportional military counterattack by Israel on Gaza, and on Iranian strongholds in the Middle East. Iran’s evident failure to fully protect its allies and military assets pointed to a receding regional influence. The US-Israel Twelve-Day War against Iran’s military, industrial, nuclear, and civilian targets in June 2025 exposed the scale of Iranian defense vulnerability. On the diplomatic front, Iran failed to work with Saudi Arabia to prevent bloodshed in Gaza or the Twelve-Day War, despite joint appeals to reduce violence and condemn the Israeli aggression. Saudi Arabia encouraged a ceasefire in Gaza, but it discouraged Tehran and its ally Hamas from regrouping against Israel. 1 The Saudi response to the Twelve-Day War arrived belatedly, after other Muslim countries first condemned the attacks. Both conflicts revealed Iran’s frequent resort to niche diplomacy: seeking limited diplomatic goals without garnering momentum to resolve conflicts. 2 Its triangular diplomacy to mobilize resources with Saudi Arabia to preempt Israeli aggression only served to sustain Tel Aviv’s hostility and cautious ties with Riyadh. 3",

    "Abstract": "We investigate the occurrence of flow circulation in an open triangular cavity filled with a gas at highly rarefied conditions. The cavity is subject to an external shear flow that is in either the circular or linear direction at its inlet. The problem is studied analytically in the free-molecular limit and numerically based on the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The corner walls are modelled based on the Maxwell boundary condition, as either specular or diffuse. The results are obtained for arbitrary values of the outer flow speed and corner angle. Remarkably, it is found that multiple recirculation zones occupy the corner domain in the absence of molecular interactions. In the specular-corner set-up, such topologies occur at non-large outer-flow speeds and distinct corner-angle intervals of $[\\pi /(n+1),\\pi /n]$ with $n=3,5,\\ldots$ . In the diffuse-wall case, the cavity flow field contains two recirculation zones at sufficiently low corner angles for both circular and straight outer flows. With increasing angles, the straight-flow configuration differs, reducing the number of vortices to one and then none. The results are rationalised based on ballistic particle kinematics, suggesting insight into the relation between the microscopic description and the hydrodynamic (observed) generation of circulation. The effects of molecular collisions on the corner flow pattern, as well as more elaborate gas-surface interaction models, are inspected based on DSMC calculations, indicating visible impacts on the macroscopic flow structure at large Knudsen numbers.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates finite-wall effects in vortex ring–wall interactions on flat circular plates with diameters $1.5D_n \\leqslant D \\leqslant 10D_n$ , where $D_n$ is the nozzle diameter. Flow visualisation experiments were conducted across a broad range of vortex Reynolds numbers, ${\\textit{Re}}_{\\varGamma } \\approx 600$ – $2800$ , while particle image velocimetry measurements were performed over a focused range of ${\\textit{Re}}_{\\varGamma } \\approx 1300$ – $1900$ . The formation length was fixed at $L/D_n = 2$ , where $L$ is the length of the ejected fluid slug. The plate sizes examined span from those reproducing the canonical infinite-wall behaviour to plates smaller than the vortex ring’s diameter. Three distinct regimes are identified based on the relative plate size: (i) ‘infinite’ plates where edge effects are negligible; (ii) ‘quasi-infinite’ plates where boundary-layer separation dominates but weak edge-generated vorticity emerges; and (iii) ‘finite’ plates where boundary-layer roll-up over the edge replaces surface separation, yielding strong edge effects. These regimes are established through vorticity contour analysis and flow visualisation, supported by quantitative measurements of circulation, trajectory, vortex-core velocity, eccentricity and boundary-layer separation. Within the explored range, geometric extent rather than Reynolds number governs the interaction dynamics. Finite-edge effects manifest through enhanced and earlier secondary vorticity formation, stronger primary vortex decay and elongated rebound trajectories with larger orbital periods. When the plate diameter becomes smaller than the vortex ring diameter, edge clipping rapidly disrupts the coherent vortex structures. The results provide a canonical framework for understanding finite-surface interactions and for distinguishing edge-induced dynamics from curvature or confinement effects observed in previous studies.",

    "Abstract": "We investigate solute dispersion in a two-phase system comprising a Casson fluid flowing in a tube and its surrounding wall phase that allows interphase solute exchange to mimic solute transport in blood and tissue phases. A pulsatile pressure gradient is imposed, and Gill’s classical methodology is extended to two-phase flows to analyse solute transport. The key parameters are the diffusivity ratio between wall and fluid phases ( $\\lambda$ ), the partition coefficient ( $\\beta _p$ ), the Womersley number ( $\\alpha$ ), the yield stress ( $\\tau _y$ ), the wall thickness ( $\\delta _h$ ) and the initial dimensionless radius of the solute source ( $a$ ). In the long-time limit, increasing $\\lambda$ , $\\beta _p$ and $\\delta _h$ reduces the phase-averaged convection ( $K_1$ ) and dispersion ( $K_2$ ) coefficients, owing to solute accumulation in the wall where convective and shear-induced transport are absent. Short-time behaviour is dictated by the rate of solute transfer to the wall. Larger $\\alpha$ enhances both $K_1$ and $K_2$ , while larger $\\tau _y$ suppresses them. The presence of a wall phase permits $K_2$ to reach $O(10^{0})$ , compared with $K_2 \\sim O(10^{-3})$ without a wall, and can delay the onset of steady state to dimensionless time $t \\sim O(10^{2})$ . Strong solute exchange and increasing wall thickness diminish downstream solute penetration, while non-Newtonian effects promote interphase transfer. These results provide mechanistic insight into solute exchange across fluid–wall interfaces, relevant to solute transport in blood flow and engineered permeable systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This essay examines how Law and Society approaches have transformed historical analysis by reconceptualizing law as constitutive of social reality rather than as an isolated formal system. Tracing this methodological revolution from 1960s American legal history through scholars like J. Willard Hurst and Lawrence Friedman to 1990s legal consciousness studies by Patricia Ewick, Susan Silbey and Sally Engle Merry, the essay demonstrates how these frameworks reveal law as lived experience operating through documentary practices and administrative procedures rather than overt coercion. Through examples from British colonial Singapore and Hong Kong, the analysis shows how legal mechanisms normalized authority, how marginalized subjects strategically navigated plural legal systems and how legal transformations eventually became invisible within naturalized landscapes. Law and Society approaches provide historians with three crucial innovations: revealing agency through strategic legal engagement, reconceptualizing power as operating through capillary networks of documentation, and reframing historical transformation as gradual reconfiguration of legal categories that denaturalizes what appears inevitable.",

Second, assume that the weak solutions have additional (uniformly in $\\epsilon$ ) regularity, then the convergence rate of vanishing global dissipation is proportional to a power function of $\\epsilon$ .

    "Abstract": "Abstract Nutrition is crucial for the growth of children and adolescents. This study investigated multiple nutritional problems and influencing factors among 2,423 students aged 6-17 in Guizhou Province, using questionnaire surveys, physical examinations, and blood tests. Multifactorial logistic and Poisson regression analyses were used to identify determinants of overnutrition and undernutrition. The results showed a distinct profile compared to national averages: wasting was more prevalent (9.6%), while overweight (8.6%) and obesity (5.0%) were less common. Notably, hyperuricemia (27.6%) and zinc deficiency (17.9%) were elevated, whereas classical metabolic syndrome (2.3%) was lower, delineating a regional pattern that prioritizes these emerging and micronutrient issues. Marginal vitamin A deficiency (17.2%) and vitamin D inadequacy (50.9%) remained significant. Older age (11-17 years) was a strong risk factor for overnutrition-related disorders and hyperuricemia (All p &lt;0.001). Overweight/obesity increased risks of hyperuricemia and metabolic syndrome (All p &lt;0.001). Being female was a major risk factor for undernutrition (PR=1.27, 95%CI: 1.19-1.35, p &lt;0.001) and vitamin D deficiency (AOR=2.51, 95%CI: 2.10-3.00, p &lt;0.001), but a protective factor against hyperuricemia (AOR=0.34, 95%CI: 0.27-0.41, p &lt;0.001). Frequent sugary drink consumption (≥3/week) elevated hyperuricemia risk (AOR=1.33, 95%CI: 1.05-1.69, p =0.020). This study underscores a complex double burden of malnutrition in western China, characterized by specific priority areas, and necessitates tailored, multi-component interventions such as limiting sugary drinks and focusing nutrition support on adolescent girls.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This article critically examines George Woodcock’s travel writings on India between 1961 and 1981, exploring the tensions between his anarchist anti-imperialism and the cultural frameworks inherited from his upbringing in the heart of empire. While Woodcock admired Gandhi and sought to understand India through a lens of philosophical anarchism, his engagement was shaped by elite literary connections and orientalist tropes that complicated his vision. The article traces how Woodcock’s political ideals, literary influences, and charitable efforts intersected with postcolonial realities, revealing the paradoxes of Western radicalism in a decolonizing world. Drawing on archival sources and offering a close reading of his three major texts on India – Faces of India, Kerala: A Portrait of the Malabar Coast , and TheWalls of India – it highlights how Woodcock’s attempts to critique empire often carried unconscious cultural assumptions. Ultimately, it argues that Woodcock’s India writings offer a valuable case study in the complexities of cross-cultural intellectual encounter in the enduring shadows of imperial discourse.",

He argues that the [mu… i]-type nominalizations are phrasal and that the [mu… a]-type nominalizations exhibit a puzzling nature, displaying both lexical and syntactic properties. This study examines Mugane’s characterization, revisiting the notion of a lexicon-syntax divide. Applying Wood’s (2023) Complex Head analysis, I demonstrate that we can explain the [mu… a]-type nominalizations within a syntactic framework without resorting to the lexicon. The analysis reveals that the puzzle is resolvable and that syntax can account for both types of nominalizations in Gĩkũyũ.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Many of Yi In-sŏng’s works, including On an Autumn Day and Room in Summer , depict tropical plants and exotic vegetation. Although the specific types of foliage he portrayed remain unclear, Yi’s use of foreign foliage clearly conveys the allure of exotic scenery. Beginning in the 1930s, coinciding with Japan’s expansion into the South Sea region, images of palm trees and exotic plants found their way into colonial Korean homes. This article investigates the emergence of the practice of portraying ‘others’ in colonial Korea, with a particular focus on the artworks of Yi In-sŏng. Yi was a renowned Western-style painter during the colonial period in Korea, celebrated for his depictions of exotic landscapes and vibrant foreign flora. While Yi’s work is often characterized as an expression of Korean ‘local colour’, this article, instead, explores Yi as an urban bourgeois and delves into his appreciation for exotic elements in his work. By contextualizing the depiction of diverse rural flora and exotic interior decorations in Yi’s urban intellectual cosmopolitanism, this article discusses how the practice of imagining ‘others’ emerged in colonial Korea during the 1930s.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In the ecologically diverse metropolitan area of Seoul, raccoon dogs ( Nyctereutes procyonoides ) coexist with humans and domestic animals, creating opportunities for vector-borne parasite transmission. Climate-driven shifts in mosquito populations may further enhance these risks, highlighting the need to monitor Dirofilaria immitis in urban wildlife for veterinary and public health. Among 51 raccoon dogs examined, D. immitis was identified in the pulmonary arteries and right ventricle of 13 animals (25.5%) by necropsy, with worm burdens ranging from 2 to 9. Lung tissue PCR revealed 4 additional subclinical infections, resulting in a final confirmed prevalence of 17 positives (33.3%). In contrast, whole-blood PCR detected only 11 positives (21.6%), all confirmed by necropsy, indicating higher sensitivity of lung tissue PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 sequences showed all isolates clustered with reference D. immitis across Asia and Europe, and haplotype analysis revealed low genetic diversity among Korean isolates. Wolbachia 16S ribosomal RNA sequences from raccoon dogs consistently grouped in supergroup C, confirming their association with D. immitis . These findings confirm natural infections of D. immitis and Wolbachia in wild raccoon dogs and highlight their potential role as urban wildlife reservoirs, while lung tissue-based molecular detection offers synergistic advantages for detecting subclinical infections and improving estimates of heartworm occurrence.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Neuromorphic vision-based robotic tactile sensors fuse touch and vision, enabling manipulators to efficiently grip and identify objects. Precise robotic manipulation requires early detection of slips on the grasped object, which is crucial for maintaining grip stability and safety. Modern closed-loop feedback technologies use measurements from neuromorphic vision-based tactile sensors to control and prevent object slippage. Unfortunately, most of these sensors measure and report data-based rather than model-based information, resulting in less efficient control capabilities. This work proposes physical and mathematical modeling of an in-house-developed neuromorphic vision-based robotic tactile sensor that utilizes a protruded marker design to demonstrate the model-based approach. This sensor is mounted on the UR10 robotic manipulator, enabling manipulation tasks such as approaching, pressing, and slipping. The neuromorphic vision-based robotic tactile sensor-derived mathematical model revealed first-order system behavior for three manipulation-related actions under study. Experimental robotic manipulator grasping work is conducted to verify and validate the sensor’s derived mathematical FOS model. Two data analysis approaches, temporal and spatial–temporal model based, are adopted to classify the manipulator-sensor actions. A long short-term memory (LSTM) temporal classifier is engineered to exploit the sensor’s derived model. Also, the LSTM spatial–temporal classifier is designed using an event-weighted centroid of the region-of-interest features. Both LSTM methods successfully identified the robotic actions performed with an accuracy of more than 99%. Additionally, quantitative slip rate estimation is carried out based on centroid estimation, and qualitative assessment of pressing force is performed using a fuzzy logic classifier.",

Results revealed an interaction effect between prenatal household income levels and neighborhood deprivation on child externalizing problems. Higher neighborhood deprivation was associated with higher child externalizing outcomes only at lower household income levels per person. Although no interaction between household income and neighborhood deprivation on child internalizing problems was observed, lower household income levels were independently associated with higher child internalizing problems. These findings underscore how prenatal individual- and neighborhood-level SES factors interact to shape children’s behavioral outcomes across childhood.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Vaccine hesitancy was a major concern during the Covid-19 pandemic, and a significant percentage of healthcare workers (HCWs) proved to be hesitant too. Various governments, including that of Greece, reacted aggressively, imposing mandates stipulating dismission of HCWs from work unless vaccinated. Hesitancy was understood as a case of moral failing and against the principle of ‘do no harm’. In this article, we deploy hermeneutics policy analysis based on interviews and analysis of texts to challenge this view. On the basis of qualitative analysis of transcripts of press conferences organized by the Greek Ministry of Health and 74 interviews with hesitant HCWs, we show that government’s and HCWs’ understanding of the risk of infection and the associated threat posed to the public health system were starkly different. For HCWs, hesitancy was linked to distrust toward political institutions, which should be treated in a different manner from a case of moral failing of HCWs. We argue that, rather than mandates, persuasion is a better strategy, since hesitancy raises the question of trust toward the politicoscientific establishment. Therefore, reforming science advice institutions so that they make use of local expertise and engage civil society is key. We focus on Greece, as we consider it to be an interesting case of a newly established science advice system with a distinctive character that we term the ‘look from inside’, based on the model of ‘ethical chief scientist,’ which makes it a brilliant case study for others considering building or reforming their systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study evaluated the growth trajectories of twins from birth to school age, focusing on weight and height z scores of children born in São Paulo. The longitudinal study comprised 188 healthy twins ( M = 9.13 years; SD = 2.16). Weight data were obtained from birth records and reassessed at school age, and height at school age. Singleton birth weights and standard growth curves were used as reference points. Overall, the proportion of children with z scores below the median decreased significantly, from 98.3% at birth to 31.4% at school age. At birth, the dispersion of z -scores below the median was significantly greater among monochorionic compared to dichorionic twins (2.051 vs. 1.701), but this difference was no longer observed at school age (1.861 vs. 0.976). In total, 68.8% of the twins showed improved weight development, with no cases of deterioration. While monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs exhibited comparable intertwin birth-weight differences, by school age MZ pairs exhibited more similar weights, whereas DZ pairs showed significantly greater weight discrepancies. For height at school age, mean height z scores were within the expected range for singletons. No significant differences were observed between monochorionic and dichorionic twins, whereas MZ pairs showed smaller within-pair height differences than DZ pairs. These findings suggest that although chorionicity plays an important role during the perinatal period — particularly due to the lower birth weights observed among monochorionic twins — its influence diminishes over time. By school age, weight and height differences are primarily determined by zygosity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Herbicide-resistant Palmer amaranth has been problematic within the United States for the past 30 years. The recent introduction of Palmer amaranth into the Pacific Northwest (PNW) prompted extensive surveys in 2023 and 2024 to collect seed samples for herbicide-resistance screening and leaf tissue for resistance-mechanism genotyping. Greenhouse dose-response bioassays were conducted in Kimberly, ID, during the summer of 2024 to assess the response of Palmer amaranth populations to selected postemergence herbicides. Resistance to glyphosate predominated across populations, and reduced sensitivity to 2,4-D, dicamba, and mesotrione was also observed. In contrast, glufosinate and saflufenacil provided effective control of PNW Palmer amaranth populations. Based on the dose-response bioassays, the effective dose required to provide 90% control (ED 90 ) of the suspected glyphosate-resistant populations was 20 to 63-fold compared to the susceptible population. Subsequent 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase ( EPSPS ) gene duplication analysis was conducted to confirm glyphosate resistance in the Palmer amaranth populations. About 74% (17 of 23) of the Palmer amaranth tissue samples showed gene duplication, with up to 150 copies of the EPSPS gene. The EPSPS gene amplification analysis of plants that survived 2X rate of glyphosate (2,520 g ae ha -1 ) showed up to 150 EPSPS genes in glyphosate-resistant populations. The widespread glyphosate resistance in the collected samples suggests that Palmer amaranth populations are being introduced into the PNW from locations where resistance to herbicide sites of action has previously evolved.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Delaying cover crop termination until planting (i.e., planting green) in no-till production systems is likely to mediate the fate of herbicides that provide soil residual activity. In a planting green scenario, there is currently limited knowledge of how the interaction between physiochemical properties of cover crop residues and sorption properties of herbicides influence the washoff potential of residual herbicides from cover crop residues. We conducted field- and laboratory-based experiments using herbicide washoff assay methods to evaluate the interaction between lignin (%) of cereal rye ( Secale cereale , L.) and herbicide lipophilicity (K ow ) on washoff potential across herbicide application timings. We contrasted herbicides with intermediate lipophilicity (atrazine, pyroxasulfone , and S -metolachlor) to less (mesotrione) and highly lipophilic (pendimethalin) herbicides. When applied into living cereal rye, washoff of atrazine and pyroxasulfone were greater than mesotrione and S -metolachlor. Pendimethalin had the least washoff potential. When applied into fresh- to aged-cereal rye residues (0 to 84 days after termination), pendimethalin washoff was below the detection threshold. Washoff of mesotrione, pyroxasulfone, and atrazine declined as lignin (%) in cereal rye residues increased, whereas a positive relationship between S -metolachlor recovery and lignin (%) was observed. Results of our study partially support the hypotheses that (1) herbicide lipophilicity, measured via log K ow values, can be a useful indicator of washoff potential among residual herbicides used in cover crop systems, and (2) washoff potential declines as cover crop residues age within herbicide application windows.",

    "Abstract": "<i><i>Cryptococcus neoformans</i></i> (<i><i>C. neoformans</i></i>) infections pose a critical threat to global health, with high mortality rates observed among immunocompromised individuals. Rapid, cost-effective diagnostics are essential for preventive treatment and reducing mortality in resource-scarce settings, yet the development of selective fluorescent probes for <i><i>C. neoformans</i></i> remains challenging. The Prp8 intein, a unique self-splicing protein in <i><i>C. neoformans</i></i>, represents an ideal target for developing fluorescent probes and antifungal drugs. In this study, a series of fluorescent probes integrating Prp8 intein inhibitors with an environment-sensitive fluorophore was developed for selective covalent binding to the Prp8 intein. Among these probes, <b>H2</b> enables specific detection of <i><i>C. neoformans</i></i> with minimal interference from <i>Candida</i> species. A dual-staining approach combining capsule staining with intracellular Prp8 intein labeling significantly improves the accuracy of <i><i>C. neoformans</i></i> detection. Probe <b>H2</b> was also successfully applied for fluorescence imaging of fungal infections in a <i>Galleria mellonella</i> model, demonstrating potential for assessing fungal infections in <i>vivo</i>. Furthermore, the fluorescence intensity of the probe exhibited a dose-dependent relationship with Prp8 inhibitor activity, enabling rapid screening of intein-splicing inhibitors within 2 h, thereby improving efficiency and reducing assay time.",

    "Abstract": "Coastal salt marshes (CSMs) are vital blue carbon (BC) reservoirs, yet accurately quantifying their gross primary productivity (GPP) remains challenging due to limitations in terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), which often overlook coastal-specific processes. Here, we present SAL-GPP, a process-based model that incorporates coastal-specific modules to capture the effects of salinity and temperature stress on photosynthesis, as well as light-use efficiency across salinity gradients in diverse CSM plant species. Model validation showed strong agreement with observations, with <i>R</i><sup>2</sup> of 0.82 and model efficiencies of 0.82 and 0.74 for daily and seasonal GPP, respectively. Driven with global inputs, SAL-GPP produced high-resolution global simulations, yielding a mean annual GPP of 66.89 ± 11.68 TgC yr<sup>-1</sup> (2011-2020), with 64% concentrated in key hotspots across the southeastern United States, western Europe, southeastern China, and Australia. From 2011 to 2016, global CSM GPP increased by 1.56 TgC yr<sup>-1</sup>, then declined, rebounded after 2018, and peaked at 71.45 ± 12.02 TgC yr<sup>-1</sup> in 2020. Model evaluation showed that SAL-GPP outperformed existing remote sensing-based GPP products and TBMs at both site and grid levels. By explicitly incorporating coastal ecosystem dynamics, SAL-GPP supports global BC accounting and climate mitigation strategies aligned with nature-based solutions for carbon neutrality.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid iteration of electronics and semiconductor technologies has brought convenience to daily life. However, the resulting large-scale production may pose health risks due to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) emissions. Here, we present the first trade-off analysis between PFAS wastewater treatment burdens and associated health benefits in electronics and semiconductor manufacturing and benchmark the costs against market values. Specifically, by 2035, the rapid expansion of these sectors is projected to discharge 4.4-10.9 kilotons of PFAS annually into wastewater, resulting in an estimated upper-bound range of 25-103 million comparative toxic units for human toxicity (CTUh) in the absence of treatment. Achieving the toxicity reduction via granular activated carbon (GAC), ion-exchange resin (IER), or reverse osmosis (RO) membranes will require annual investments of $16.5-50.0 billion across regions in 2035, equivalent to ∼0.5% of the respective electronics market value via IER. Moreover, we find that variations in breakthrough performance substantially alter both economic and environmental burdens, particularly in electronics wastewater, which is dominated by short-chain PFAS, whose limited removal efficiency amplifies these effects. By quantifying the cost-health nexus, our findings provide actionable insights for PFAS governance and reinforce the urgency of globally coordinated efforts to align industrial growth with environmental and public health protection.",

Structural characterizations confirm the formation of a uniform Ga(core)/Ag(shell) architecture with intimate interfacial contact, which enables strong electron coupling between Ag and Ga. Electrochemical measurements in an organic tetrabutylammonium chloride (Bu<sub>4</sub>NCl)/acetonitrile (AN) electrolyte demonstrate that Ga@Ag exhibits a more positive onset potential, a higher CO partial current density, and a remarkable Faradaic efficiency for CO production (92.3%) at -2.4 V (vs SHE), significantly surpassing Ag powder.

However, seed nitrogen, protein, and amino acid concentrations were significantly increased by Pi starvation. Combined with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and RNA sequencing analyses of developing seeds, a total of 522 differentially accumulated metabolites (DAMs) were identified, particularly increased accumulations of amino acids, such as l-arginine and l-glutamine. Meanwhile, a total of 3793 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected, with 1764 upregulated and 2029 downregulated by Pi starvation. Notably, the integration of metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed a tight connection between DEGs and DAMs in developing seeds, especially for nitrogen translocation and assimilation. Collectively, this study highlights the complex and distinct responses of young soybean seeds to P deficiency, which provides candidate genes for improving the soybean seed protein concentration.",

    "Abstract": "Sabinene, a high-value monoterpene with broad industrial applications, is facing growing demand. To enable sustainable and cost-efficient production, we engineered the yeast <i>Pichia pastoris</i> for sabinene production from methanol. Through systematic metabolic engineering, we implemented a multipronged strategy to optimize sabinene biosynthesis: (1) enhancing precursor supply and synthase activity via fusion proteins (<i>ERG20</i><sup><i>WW</i></sup>-<i>tNPPS1</i> and <i>ERG20</i><sup><i>WW</i></sup>-<i>t37SabS1</i> (<i>H561F</i>)), (2) redirecting carbon flux through the phosphoketolase-phosphotransacetylase pathway, and (3) upregulating the mevalonate pathway via overexpression of a truncated HMGR. The engineered strain achieved record-high sabinene titers of 3.24 g/L in shake flasks and 6.38 g/L in a 3-L bioreactor. Notably, this yield surpasses those achieved with conventional sugar-based feedstocks in other microbial hosts, underscoring the potential of methanol as a superior carbon source for terpenoid biosynthesis. This work not only establishes <i>P. pastoris</i> as a promising platform for sabinene production, but also paves the way for methanol-based biomanufacturing of diverse natural products.",

    "Abstract": "Emerging research evidence has established the critical role of inflammatory cascades in the development and progression of alcoholic liver injury with hepatocellular death serving as a principal driver. Notably, the dysregulated interplay between mitochondrial homeostasis and pyroptosis is primarily responsible for the alcohol-induced aberrant liver immune microenvironment, characterized by nonresolving inflammation. Given the considerable limitations in the current treatment for alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH), it is imperative to explore targeted nutritional interventions as alternative therapies. Here, we established an ASH model with C57BL/6J mice and demonstrated that astaxanthin (AST) administration significantly protected against alcohol-induced inflammatory liver injury through dual mechanisms: 1) suppression of hepatocyte pyroptosis by inhibiting the NLRP-3/Caspase/GSDMD signaling axis and 2) mitigation of mitochondrial dysfunction evidenced by structural membrane integrity restoration and redox homeostasis rebalancing. Mechanistically, AST intervention impeded the cytoplasmic translocation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), thereby concurrently inhibiting AIM2 inflammasome activation and cGAS/STING signaling. In vitro studies further confirmed dose-dependent attenuation of alcohol-induced hepatotoxicity by AST, marked by reduced pyroptotic cell death and diminished proinflammatory cytokine secretion (IL-1β, IL-18). Mitochondrial protection was further evidenced through restored membrane potential (ΔΨm), decreased cytoplasmic Cytochrome <i>C</i> release, and attenuated mtDNA leakage. Moreover, we identified a novel molecular interaction, wherein AST competitively binds lipid-binding motifs within the β1-β2 loop of the GSDMD-N-terminal domain, potentially interfering with pyroptotic pore formation. Further overexpression experiments confirmed the improvement effect of AST on pyroptosis induced by GSDMD-N pore formation. Concurrently, AST exhibited potent antioxidant effects against alcohol-induced cardiolipin peroxidation, suggesting dual therapeutic modalities targeting both pyroptotic execution and mitochondrial membrane stabilization. Collectively, our findings identify AST as a promising candidate for therapeutic interventions against alcoholic inflammatory liver injury through coordinated modulation of the pyroptosis-mitochondrial homeostasis crosstalk, offering novel insights into nutritional intervention strategies for alcohol-related liver pathologies.",

    "Abstract": "Closely related membrane transporters can diverge sharply in their modes of transport despite minimal sequence differences, underscoring how minor structural features can alter the transport function. This divergence is exemplified in nitrate and nitrite transport across bacterial membranes, which supports anaerobic respiration and involves the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters NarK and NarU. NarK operates as a nitrate/nitrite antiporter, whereas NarU's mechanism remains unresolved, with evidence suggesting potential symport activity. Using extensive adaptive molecular dynamics simulations and Markov State Modeling, we mapped NarU's conformational free-energy landscape and assessed how its behavior contrasts with mechanistic principles established for NarK. NarU follows a similar gating pathway but displays pronounced asymmetry favoring the outward-facing state and stabilizes an <i>apo</i>-occluded intermediate inaccessible to antiporters. This state arises from rotation of an arginine gating pair and a hinged glycine substitution that enhances gate flexibility. These sequence-dependent adaptations alter gating energetics and reprogram the scaffold to permit coupled cotransport. Our results show that the presence of a few strategic residue substitutions in the binding pocket and translocation pathway could alter the transport mechanism of transporters with high sequence and structural similarity.",

    "Abstract": "We report a highly enantioselective and efficient synthesis of C-3 substituted butenolides via a tandem C-H activation/Michael addition cascade, enabled by Rh/cinchonine dual catalysis. This strategy leverages the stability and accessibility of the achiral [Cp*RhCl<sub>2</sub>]<sub>2</sub> complex in combination with the chiral induction provided by the naturally occurring alkaloid cinchonine, eliminating the need for complex chiral ligands. Importantly, this dual catalytic system represents the first enantioselective protocol that exploits simple acrylic acids as coupling partners, thereby extending the reactivity paradigm beyond conventional benzoic acid derivatives and significantly broadening the substrate scope beyond aromatic counterparts. The reaction proceeds in a one-pot fashion under mild conditions, delivering a wide range of products with good to very good enantiomeric excess.",

Advancements have been made toward establishing structure-function-activity relationships through synthesis and structural characterization of biomimetic Fe-S clusters. However, their conformational plasticity and multiconfigurational character pose significant challenges in capturing the underlying electronic structure. The treatment of both strong and dynamic correlation effects is integral in bridging the gap between electronic and physical structure to rationalize metallocluster reactivity. Here, we employ a computationally tractable, multireference methodology that captures both strong and dynamic correlation effects to simulate a series of chemically and electronically diverse, site-differentiated [4Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> clusters, elucidating the effects of cooperative electron correlation and primary coordination sphere modification on electron and spin (de)localization, geometric isomerism, and chemical reactivity.",

Crystalline silicon was first used to monitor the multistep functionalization by quantitative IR-ATR spectroscopy. The attachment of an alkynyl FTIR marker on crystalline silicon demonstrated the effectiveness of the methodology, which was then applied onto macroporous silicon to anchor an enantiopure chromium-salen complex as a first step toward the development of new supported asymmetric organometallic catalysts on silicon-based materials. SEM and EDS measurements clearly show good homogeneity of the polymer growth through the porous layers with a uniform distribution of the catalysts (even deep inside the pores).

    "Abstract": "Owing to their high-specific surface area and low thermal conductivity, nanoporous materials are widely regarded as promising media for adsorbed natural gas (ANG) storage. However, the gas-solid coupling during methane transport within these materials is governed by the coupled effects of temperature and pressure, which traditional theoretical models struggle to accurately quantify. In this work, a multiscale approach is employed. At the nanoscale, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to quantitatively determine the influence of temperature and pressure on methane adsorption capacity, effective thermal conductivity, and the gas-solid coupling region. Based on these results, a Langmuir adsorption model is refined, and a quantitative correlation for the gas-solid coupling area under varying temperatures and pressures is established. At the macroscale, an effective thermal conductivity predictive model for methane-laden porous media is developed based on established heat transfer theories, incorporating the aforementioned gas-solid coupling effects. Furthermore, by comparing different models, the dominant pressure regimes for distinct coupling mechanisms are clearly identified: at low pressures (<i>P</i> < 2.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> Pa), heat transfer is dominated by the solid backbone, and the local gas-solid interaction is negligible. Conversely, at high pressures (<i>P</i> > 2.1 × 10<sup>5</sup> Pa), the local gas-solid interaction becomes a significant mechanism, with its contribution increasing sharply with pressure.",

    "Abstract": "Commercial separators face significant challenges in mitigating lithium dendrite growth, primarily due to non-uniform lithium ion deposition, which leads to battery performance degradation and raises safety concerns related to separator failure. To address these issues, this study proposes a novel composite separator incorporating two-dimensional (2D) X-type molecular sieves as a functional coating for lithium metal battery separators. The primary objective is to achieve uniform lithium-ion distribution across the surface of the lithium metal anode, thereby effectively inhibiting the formation of lithium dendrites. The results indicate that in comparison to conventional polypropylene (PP) separators, the 2D-X-PP composite separators exhibit substantially improved physical properties, such as enhanced thermal stability, wettability, and tensile strength. In terms of electrochemical performance, cells incorporating the 2D-X-PP separators retained an outstanding 70% of their initial capacity after 1000 cycles, while those employing PP separators retained less than 50% of their capacity after only 500 cycles. These findings provide strong evidence of the exceptional performance of 2D-X-PP and further pave the way for the development of molecular-sieve-functionalized separators in lithium metal batteries.",

    "Abstract": "The relentless challenges of uncontrolled zinc dendrite growth and severe interfacial side reactions pose a significant threat to the operation and reliability of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs). To counter these challenges, this work introduces a novel multifunctional interfacial layer engineered from diatomite (DIA) on the zinc anode. The hierarchically ordered porous architecture and enhanced surface area of modified diatomite (M-DIA) serve as an ion transport channel to homogenize the Zn<sup>2+</sup> ion flux, further suppressing dendrite formation. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic layer acts as a robust physical barrier, effectively shielding the zinc surface from the aqueous electrolyte. This concerted mechanism yields a dendrite-free morphology and exceptional corrosion resistance. Consequently, the M-DIA@Zn anode enables remarkably stable symmetric cell cycling stability over 1200 h at 2 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> and 1500 h at 5 mA cm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively, and achieves an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.6% in asymmetric cells. When paired with a MnO<sub>2</sub> cathode, the full cell exhibits superior capacity retention (260 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> after 100 cycles) and outstanding rate performance. This work underscores the potential of natural diatomite as a multifunctional interface for stabilizing metal anodes, offering a promising pathway toward high-performance and durable zinc-based energy storage.",

    "Abstract": "Rapid and effective bleeding control is essential for saving lives from severe hemorrhage. Currently, expandable hemostatic materials are in urgent demand for narrow and deep wounds because they can be quickly packed into a wound cavity and expand internally to generate pressure that promotes hemostasis. In this work, a zeolite-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) composite sponge was first prepared by decorating zeolite powders onto a commercial medical PVA sponge, and it was further fabricated into small tablets in a compressed state. The small tablets can be easily loaded inside a syringe-like applicator for rapidly injecting into deep wounds in less than 3 s, and they can quickly expand six times in less than 30 s when they come into contact with blood. This material shows outstanding hemostatic efficiency and excellent biosafety. In a New Zealand rabbit severe femoral artery hemorrhage model, the short average hemostasis time (123 s) and the small total blood loss (9.9 g) for the zeolite-PVA sponge group clearly demonstrate its outstanding hemostatic efficiency, compared to the commercial Celox sponge group (220 s and 22.9 g) and the gauze group (333 s and 28.5 g). Consequently, the timely and effective hemostasis led to a 100% survival rate for the zeolite-PVA sponge group in this severe femoral artery hemorrhage model. On the contrary, the survival rates of the gauze group and the Celox sponge group were only 67% and 83%, respectively. This rapidly expandable zeolite-PVA sponge material provides a promising solution for meeting the challenge of massive hemorrhage in narrow and deep wounds.",

    "Abstract": "Lipoteichoic acid (LTA), a component of the Gram-positive bacterial cell wall, exhibits potent immunomodulatory properties. However, it is highly unstable and susceptible to degradation under gastrointestinal conditions, which limits its in vivo functional application. In this study, LTA from the<i>Lactobacillus johnsonii</i> was encapsulated into chitosan-tripolyphosphate (CS-TPP) nanoparticles for the first time, establishing a robust delivery system. The resulting LTA@CS-TPP nanoparticles displayed uniform nano size, favorable stability, high encapsulation efficiency, and sustained release behavior. Simulated digestion assays demonstrated that nanoencapsulation effectively protected LTA from gastric degradation and enabled controlled release in the intestinal phase. Cellular experiments showed that LTA@CS-TPP enhanced antioxidative stress defenses, reduced intracellular ROS levels, and alleviated LPS-induced inflammatory injury. Immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that LTA@CS-TPP significantly suppressed NF-κB activation and nuclear translocation, suggesting interference with the TLR<sub>4</sub>/MyD88/NF-κB signaling cascade. Compared with free LTA, nanoencapsulation not only preserved but also amplified its bioactivity, whereas blank CS-TPP nanoparticles exerted minimal effects. Collectively, these findings provide the first evidence of chitosan-based nanoencapsulation of LTA and highlight its potential as a bioactive delivery platform for inflammation modulation, laying the groundwork for future oral administration studies with promising applications in functional foods and therapeutic strategies.",

Although Ir-based materials exhibit excellent performance, their scarcity and high cost hinder large-scale applications. Recent advances are focused on non-Ir-based catalysts, including Ru-based systems, transition-metal oxides, and metal-free materials, where strategies such as defect engineering, heteroatom doping, interface modulation, and high-entropy design can effectively tune electronic structures for better performance with improved stability. Active sites and reaction intermediates under working conditions are explored for getting deeper insights into the mechanism, using advanced in situ/operando characterization techniques. Nevertheless, under harsh acidic conditions, mental dissolution and structural degradation of catalysts still limit long-term operation. Therefore, future efforts will integrate AI-driven high-throughput screening to accelerate the rational design of catalysts while simultaneously optimizing PEM electrolyzer architectures and operando characterization techniques. Furthermore, developing sustainable seawater electrolysis technology could promote acidic OER toward large-scale green hydrogen production.",

    "Abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains a formidable clinical challenge due to its aggressive phenotype and limited therapeutic options. Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, is evolving as a highly promising approach to combat TNBC. However, tumor cells deploy redundant ferroptosis defense systems including glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) systems to evade this lethal process. Here, doxorubicin (DOX) and teriflunomide (Tfm) were used as therapeutic building blocks for the self-assembly of tumor-targeting, excipient-free nanoassemblies (DoT) that enhance ferroptosis induction in TNBC. After being trapped in cancer cells, the FDA-approved antitumor drug DOX could not only disrupt the GPX4 defense system by inhibiting Nrf2 but also ignite an intracellular reactive oxygen species storm to unleash a lipid peroxidation spark. Simultaneously, Tfm further devastated the intracellular ferroptosis defense system by suppressing DHODH and crippling the radical-trapping antioxidant capacity, thus evoking robust ferroptotic cell death in TNBC cells. The work presents a synergistic co-disruption strategy against dual ferroptosis defense systems, exhibiting significant potential for clinical applications.",

    "Abstract": "The development of efficient and stable blue-light emissive organic materials that retain long-range structural order remains a key challenge for optoelectronic applications. Soft materials are a wonderful platform for fabricating various optoelectronic materials as they offer a unique opportunity to combine molecular tunability with a polycrystalline nature. Herein, we report a series of alkyl-substituted 1,4-bis(imidazolyl)benzene gelators designed to investigate the effect of side-chain modulation on supramolecular assembly, xerogel formation, and electroluminescent behavior. Systematic gelation studies reveal that molecules with alkyl chains longer than butyl form robust organogels through a balance of van der Waals and hydrogen-bonding interactions, with xerogels exhibiting polycrystalline features confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction. Structural analyses and computational studies establish that alkylation increases molecular nonplanarity, disrupts face-to-face π···π stacking, and induces pronounced blue shifts in emission relative to the nonalkylated analogue. Incorporation of selected derivatives into the emissive layer of organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) demonstrates a clear evolution from bluish-green to pure blue emission, with the butyl and octyl-substituted compound delivering high color purity (CIE 0.16, 0.07; 0.16,0.13), narrow emission bandwidth, and intrinsic electrical and morphological robustness of the xerogel-derived polycrystalline emissive layers. Notably, the butyl derivative exhibits an operational threshold voltage of only 2.8 V, which ranks among the lowest values reported for undoped pristine small-molecule OLEDs. These finding highlights side chain-length-directed supramolecular packing as a powerful design strategy for controlling emission color and accessing ordered soft-material electroluminescence, positioning bis-imidazole xerogels as promising candidates for emerging flexible optoelectronic technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Efficient delivery remains a major challenge for therapeutic genome editing because many widely used CRISPR nucleases are large and leave limited space for regulatory elements or additional payloads in a single adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. Miniature Cas12 nucleases are particularly appealing, as their reduced size alleviates packaging constraints while preserving RNA-guided DNA cleavage. Here, we outline a workflow that links large-scale sequence mining with phylogenetic and structural filtering, followed by PAM profiling, <i>in vitro</i> cleavage, bacterial genome interference, and genome-editing assays in human cells to confirm activity. This protocol is intended to distill broad sequence collections into a small set of compact Cas12 nucleases with demonstrated functions that can serve as starting points for further engineering in delivery-limited settings.",

    "Abstract": "The addition of hard fillers to polymeric networks allows for enhancement of mechanical properties, generally at the expense of extensibility. In the case of filled elastomers (such as tires), the hard particles cause damage to the underlying network when strained, resulting in severe mechanical hysteresis in cyclic loading experiments (the Mullins effect). As such, dynamic networks, which are able to heal damage through exchange reactions, are a promising candidate for composite matrices. This work investigates the influence of tunable dynamic bonds at the surface of silica particles in the presence of a fixed, complementary dynamic network matrix. The surface chemistry, composed of benzalcyanoacetamide Michael acceptors, undergoes room temperature, catalyst-free dynamic exchange with thiols with equilibrium constants (<i>K</i><sub>eq</sub>) that can be manipulated by the electronic nature of the acceptor. Increasing the <i>K</i><sub>eq</sub> of the particle surface relative to the dynamic matrix was found to promote the overall reinforcement of the composites, while also influencing the phase separation behavior of the matrix. Critically, tensile experiments reveal that ambient dynamic exchange allows for the recovery of network damage as a function of waiting time between loading cycles.",

    "Abstract": "Polysarcosine (PSar) has been recognized as a promising alternative to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in biomedical fields. The development of efficient methods for synthesizing PSar with complex architectures is therefore essential for creating optimal biomaterials. Herein, we propose a \"one-pot\" approach for synthesizing PSar molecular bottlebrush (MBB) with abundant active terminal amino groups through the combination of N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) polymerization and monomer-emulsified aqueous ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ME-ROMP). Briefly, the NCA polymerization of Sar-NCA monomer using norbornenyl amino (NB-NH<sub>2</sub>) as the initiator was first conducted to prepare norbornenyl terminal PSar (NB-PSar). Subsequently, without purification, this NB-PSar macromonomer was employed to synthesize PSar MBBs with precise architecture by ME-ROMP in the CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>/H<sub>2</sub>O (<i>v</i>/<i>v</i> = 1/10) mixtures through a grafting-through strategy. Kinetic studies indicated that the entire process could be completed within 20 min with near-quantitative conversion, and worm-like PSar MBBs with varied length and diameter could be easily synthesized by varying the feed ratios. Moreover, the terminal secondary amines of PSar side chains were retained, which could be further utilized for the surface modification of the MBBs. This work provides a one-pot approach for worm-like nanostructured PSar materials, which are expected to hold promising potential for creating advanced biomaterials.",

    "Abstract": "Nanoneedles are emerging as a safe and scalable strategy for the genetic modification of primary human cells. However, a limited understanding of how interactions at the biointerface lead to functional gene expression continues to hinder clinical translation. While direct membrane penetration, permeabilization, and endocytosis have been proposed as intracellular delivery avenues, the mechanistic connection between delivery and successful transfection remains unclear. Here, we identify caveolae-mediated endocytosis, dependent on Caveolin-1, as a key mechanism enabling nanoneedle transfection. By selectively modulating Caveolin-1 expression in primary human regulatory T cells and MG63 cells and investigating endolysosomal processing, we show that although nucleic acids can be efficiently delivered in the absence of Caveolin-1, gene expression occurs only when caveolar endocytosis is present. These findings reveal a mechanistic basis and establish a broader design principle for nanoneedle transfection: interfacing must be accompanied by the engagement of permissive cellular trafficking pathways to achieve gene expression.",

    "Abstract": "The structures and properties of moiré patterns in the twisted bilayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials are known to depend sensitively on the twist angle, yet their dependence on the stacking order remains comparatively underexplored. In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate the combined effects of the stacking order and rotation in MoS<sub>2</sub> bilayers. Beginning from five well-established high-symmetry bilayer stackings, we apply twist angles between 1° and 120° to the top layer, revealing a variety of relaxed moiré structures. Our results show that the initial stacking significantly influences the moiré domain configurations that emerge at a given twist angle. While all five stacking orders are metastable without twist, they form two moiré-equivalent classes, AA/AB and AA'/A'B/AB', <i>i.e</i>., for a given twist angle, structures within each class relax to the same moiré configuration. Specifically, initial AA and AB stackings give rise to triangular ferroelectric domains near 0 ± 3°, while AA', A'B, and AB' stackings produce triangular ferroelectric domains near 60 ± 3°. At precisely 60° and 120° twists, the bilayers relax into pure high-symmetry stackings, highlighting the rotational relationships between these configurations and explaining the shift of 60° in the ferroelectric rotational range. These findings demonstrate the critical role of the stacking order in governing the rich moiré landscapes accessible in twistronic systems.",

    "Abstract": "The rising prevalence of metabolic diseases represents a global health challenge, among which metabolically unhealthy normal-weight individuals constitute a largely ignored subgroup. Fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), which contains substantial nanoscale particulate matter, is a recognized extrinsic environmental trigger of metabolic disorders in both obese and nonobese situations, whereas the loss of plasticity in inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) is a critical intrinsic pathological feature of metabolic diseases. However, the long-term metabolic effects of maternal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure on nonobese offspring, particularly in iWAT plasticity, and underlying cellular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we revealed that maternal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure induced insulin resistance in middle-aged male mouse offspring and identified iWAT as a susceptible adipose depot with impaired plasticity, which is characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy, inflammation, fibrosis, and metabolic dysfunction. Using single-cell RNA sequencing on iWAT from middle-aged male mouse offspring, we found that maternal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure altered the fate decisions of adipose-derived stem cells from adipogenesis to fibrosis through increasing CD142<sup>+</sup> adipogenesis-regulatory cell expansion and inducing fibrogenesis in DPP4<sup>+</sup> adipose stem cells. Mechanistically, maternal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure induced IgG production from plasma cells, which promoted fibrogenesis in DPP4<sup>+</sup> adipose stem cells by activating macrophages. This process was further exacerbated by monocyte- and macrophage-mediated inflammation. Finally, maternal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure induced endothelial cell heterogeneity shifts and dysfunction, facilitating immune cell recruitment and naïve B cell differentiation into plasma cells, ultimately initiating IgG-triggered plasticity impairment. This study provided insights into the adverse effects of maternal exposure to environmental pollution on the metabolic health of offspring at single-cell resolution.",

In particular, the self-mixing signal of a mid-infrared quantum cascade laser is used to detect the oscillation of a membrane driven by light-induced forces exerted by a near-infrared excitation beam, which is amplitude-modulated at the membrane resonance frequency. This technique benefits from spectral broadness and, therefore, can link different spectral regions from both the excitation and probe sides.

    "Abstract": "2-amino-deoxyadenosine (dZ) occurs naturally in certain bacteriophage genomes, where it replaces deoxyadenosine, forming three hydrogen bonds with thymidine. This noncanonical deoxyribonucleoside underlies the unique biophysical properties of dZ-DNA. Its corresponding ribonucleoside has been introduced to RNA to form Z-modified RNA, with promising applications in vaccine production and biomedicine. Unlike dZ-DNA, Z-modified RNA has only been synthesized in vitro, which required the addition of chemically synthesized 2-amino-adenosine triphosphate (ZTP) as a precursor. Here, we describe enzyme engineering studies on dZMP-succinate-synthetase (PurZ), a key enzyme in the bacteriophage dZ-DNA biosynthetic pathway that natively catalyzes the conversion of deoxyguanosine monophosphate (dGMP) to dZMP-succinate. Through site-saturation mutagenesis, we generated mutants with altered substrate specificity, capable of catalyzing the conversion of GMP to ZMP-succinate. We further demonstrated that these mutants, in combination with bacterial adenylosuccinate lyase, guanylate kinase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, efficiently convert GMP to ZTP, marking a critical step in developing a biosynthetic pathway for Z-modified RNA, and enabling enzymatic synthesis of ZTP on a semipreparative scale. Our work provides the basis for further research on the impacts of Z-modified RNA in living organisms, and supports the cost-effective production of Z-modified RNA vaccines and therapeutics.",

    "Abstract": "Photosensitizers (PSs) play crucial roles in photocatalysis by efficiently harvesting light and facilitating photoinduced charge transfer. However, whether they are applied in a homogeneous solution or immobilized on catalysts, PSs are prone to deactivation through leaching or desorption, leading to a significant decline in photocatalytic performance. Herein, two highly photoactive metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) denoted as <b>NWUM-Cd-</b><i>s</i> and <b>NWUM-Cd</b> were constructed from Cd(II) ions, 4,4',4''-nitrilotribenzoic acid (H<sub>3</sub>TCA), and a classic [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> PS via cocrystallization. These MOFs can firmly lock the [Ru(bpy)<sub>3</sub>]<sup>2+</sup> PS through the structural characteristics of DNA-like double-helix and \"···ABABA···\" dislocation stacking. This prevents the PS from deactivating during the photocatalytic process, which enables these MOFs to exhibit excellent photocatalytic activity and long-term cycling stability in the model CO<sub>2</sub> photoreduction reaction. The CO production rate of interpenetrated <b>NWUM-Cd-</b><i>s</i> (13.9 mmol g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>) is 5.3 times that of dislocated monolayer <b>NWUM-Cd</b> (2.6 mmol g<sup>-1</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>). In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the interpenetrated structure of <b>NWUM-Cd-</b><i>s</i> significantly enhances the separation of photogenerated charges, which in turn reduces the overall reaction energy barrier and promotes electron-proton transfer cooperativity, thus leading to more outstanding photoactivity than that of <b>NWUM-Cd</b>. This work demonstrates unprecedented staggered stacking and DNA-like interlocking strategies to lock PSs in catalysts, thereby tackling the long-standing challenges in traditional photocatalysis of low light utilization efficiency, PS deactivation, and slow charge transfer.",

    "Abstract": "The coordination number between the bound metal center and the supporting nitrogen atoms in single-metal-atom nitrogen-carbon catalysts (M-N-C) is an important structural parameter that can impact the catalytic activity. Understanding the structure-activity relationship between coordination number and catalytic activity is made challenging by difficulties in obtaining M-N-C catalysts with precisely controlled metal-nitrogen coordination environments. Herein, we address this challenge using heterogeneous molecular catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) constructed by depositing structure-defined organometallic molecules on a catalytically inert carbon nanotube substrate. The explicit metal-nitrogen coordination environments enabled us to establish accurate ORR activity-structure correlations for cobalt metal centers with first-shell Co-N coordination numbers of 3 to 5 (Co-N<i>x</i>, where <i>x</i> = 3, 4, and 5). A good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental ORR activity and selectivity was seen. Of note, Co atoms in an asymmetric coordination environment were found to exhibit higher activity for the two-electron (2e) ORR. Kinetic studies and <i>operando</i> spectroscopic measurements further revealed that the first-shell coordinating C or N atoms in asymmetric Co-N3 and Co-N5 centers could be protonated and participate in the ORR as a proton relay. The present study may aid in understanding the role of the coordination environment in other metal-based catalytic systems being applied to renewable energy conversion reactions.",

Moreover, multi-color waveforms composed of independently manipulable ultrashort pulses in distinct spectral bands offer unique advantages in pulse synthesis and attosecond science. However, the generation and control of ultrashort pulses has required bulky and expensive optical systems at the tabletop scale and has so far been beyond the reach of integrated photonics. Here, we break these limitations and demonstrate two-optical-cycle pulse compression using quadratic two-color soliton dynamics in lithium niobate nanophotonics. By leveraging dispersion engineering and operation near phase matching, we achieve extreme compression, energy-efficient operation, and strong conversion of pump to the second harmonic. We experimentally demonstrate generation of ∼13 fs pulses at 2 µm using only ∼3 pJ of input energy. We further illustrate how the demonstrated scheme can be readily extended to on-chip single-cycle pulse synthesis with sub-cycle control. Our results provide a path towards realization of single-cycle ultrafast systems in nanophotonic circuits.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The endocannabinoid ligand anandamide (AEA) plays a role in fear extinction, the conceptual foundation of the gold standard treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), exposure-based psychotherapy. Converging evidence from animal models and non-clinical human studies highlights the potential to enhance fear extinction pharmacologically by inhibiting the AEA catabolic enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). However, in our randomized clinical trial ( n = 100), a FAAH inhibitor did no better than placebo at enhancing the response to exposure-based therapy in PTSD. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the neurobiological effects of FAAH inhibitor treatment on resting-state functional connectivity and the neural correlates of emotional processing ( n = 76 scanned). We found that greater symptom improvement was significantly related to lower functional connectivity between ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), as well as lower task activation of the right dlPFC. Further, we found that self-reported symptoms at the time of scan were associated with increased functional connectivity of the vmPFC and the amygdala across the cortex (mainly in the ventral attention network and sensorimotor network, respectively). However, while we confirmed that 4 weeks of FAAH inhibition significantly increased AEA, there were no significant differences in functional connectivity or task activation between treatment groups. These findings suggest that FAAH inhibition does not affect intrinsic functional connectivity or emotional task response in PTSD, and that the dlPFC may play an important role in the response to exposure-based psychotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose This retrospective, non-randomised, observational cohort study investigated the efficiency of a novel 23G trocar adapter to accelerate silicone oil (SO) injection during endotamponading vitreoretinal surgery. Subjects A total of 105 eyes were included consecutively. Only 23G procedures were eligible. Indications for SO injection were retinal detachment, recurrent retinal detachment, or SO exchange in eyes with retinal instability using either the high-flow viscous-fluid-extraction accessory cannula as the 23G trocar sleeve adapter (1362.VFE2, Dutch Ophthalmic Research Centre [DORC], Zuidland, the Netherlands; n Densiron 68 = 30, n DORC Silicone 5000 = 30) or the universal polyvinyl chloride (PVC) infusion tube as the standard method (1279.VFI, DORC; n Densiron 68 = 30, n DORC Silicone 5000 = 15). Eyes with aphakia, traumatic retinal conditions, or combined surgical procedures were excluded. Methods Pars plana vitrectomy was performed, and after complete fluid–air exchange, SO was injected. The trocar sleeve adapter group was treated with an injection pressure of 2.5 bar and with the trocar valve removed. The standard group was treated with 4 bar pressure and with the valve left in place. The time needed to achieve functionally complete filling of the vitreous cavity with SO was recorded. Safety outcomes included the number of device disconnection events and the occurrence of any major complications. Results Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the injection duration was significantly affected by SO type ( β = 342.6, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 270.1–415.1, p &lt; 0.0001), device type ( β = 190.3, 95% CI: 117.2–263.5, p &lt; 0.0001), and axial length ( β = 40.3, 95% CI: 21.6–59.1, p &lt; 0.0001). Application of the 23G trocar sleeve adapter significantly reduced the injection time needed to fill the vitreous cavity with Densiron 68, from 258.9 ± 74.7 s (PVC; 95% CI: 231.0–286.8; 241.5 ± 78 s [median ± interquartile range]) to 89.8 ± 55.0 s (95% CI: 69.3–110.4; 76.0 ± 50.5 s; p &lt; 0.0001, Fisher’s LSD, two-way ANOVA). For DORC Silicone 5000, a time reduction from 773.7 ± 257.7 s (95% CI: 631.0–916.4; 835.0 ± 332.0) to 152.8 ± 44.5 s was achieved (95% CI: 136.2–169.4; 153.0 ± 66.5; p &lt; 0.0001, Fisher’s LSD, two-way ANOVA). Comparisons of vitreous volume–adjusted injection durations calculated using the VIVEX formula yielded similar results (both p &lt; 0.0001). Three disconnection events occurred, and all procedures were completed without major complications. Conclusions Although the 23G trocar sleeve adapter was developed for SO extraction, it reduced the time required for low- and high-viscosity SO injection by three- and fivefold, respectively. The 23G trocar sleeve adapter thus has the potential to substantially shorten SO injection times in clinical practice, although randomised or crossover study designs will be required for validation.",

    "Abstract": "Extensive studies have shown that talin is the essential player for inside-out activation of integrins by binding to the intracellular tail of β integrins. Here we show that, while talin binding is essential for inside-out integrin activation in focal adhesions, it is dispensable in curved adhesions - a distinct adhesion architecture exclusively mediated by integrin αvβ5 and selectively formed at curved membranes. Instead, a curvature-sensing protein FCHo2 binds to the HDRRE motif in integrin β5's cytoplasmic tail and inside-out activates integrin αvβ5 in curved adhesions. FCHo2 does not bind to a similar motif in the homologous integrin β3. We identify a pivotal tryptophan (W), which is conserved in all homologous β integrins except β5, where it is replaced by a tyrosine (Y766). This tyrosine substitution is crucial for integrin β5's unique capability in forming curved adhesions. Furthermore, our studies suggest that the phosphorylation state of Y766 regulates whether integrin ɑvβ5 forms curved adhesions or focal adhesions. Overall, our work unveils distinct molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms between curved adhesions and focal adhesions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Metastatic tumor cell dissemination is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Clustered circulating tumor cells (CTCs) possess higher metastatic potential than single CTCs. Epithelial adherens junction (AJ) proteins typically mediate stable cell-cell interactions; however, these proteins are frequently lost in highly aggressive triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), raising the question of how CTCs from such tumors cluster. Here we show that the extracellular matrix (ECM) component hyaluronan (HA) mediates AJ-independent CTC clustering in TNBCs. HA is necessary and sufficient to drive clustering of tumor cells expressing its receptor CD44. Mechanistically, HA initiates contact between neighboring cells through actin-based membrane protrusions. As cells are pulled closer, these initial interactions expand to membrane-membrane contact and are subsequently stabilized by desmosomes. CTC-derived HA also acts as a docking platform to promote heterotypic cluster formation by recruiting non-CTCs, including immune cells. Thus, this ECM–receptor interaction enables CTC clustering and survival under shear stress, enhancing TNBC metastasis.",

    "Abstract": "Fracturing is unavoidable and threatens the reliability and functionality of materials. Therefore, regulating the propagation of cracks in a predictable and ductile manner is of paramount importance. Herein, we exploit the properties of topological mechanical metamaterials (TMMs) as a versatile mechanism to guide cracks unidirectionally and turn fracturing of lattices made of brittle materials into ductile events. Inspired by quantum topological states, recent discoveries of TMMs have uncovered varieties of unconventional mechanical phenomena, ranging from one-way wave propagation to polar elasticity. We show that polarized floppy modes occurring in TMMs lead to strongly asymmetric stress fields localizing around the notch tips, leading to ductile one-way fracturing, in sharp contrast to classical theories of fractures in brittle materials. Our work demonstrates the universality of this fracture unidirectionality feature, which is protected by TMM's bulk topology, and provides robust solutions in programmable fracturing for a broad class of materials and structures.",

    "Abstract": "The disruption of intestinal homeostasis represents a hallmark of different diseases. Here, we report a montmorillonite-based oral fermentation system (MOFS) that achieves long-lasting in-situ preparation of beneficial bioproducts for intestinal homeostasis restoration. MOFS is fabricated by loading metabolic substrates in the lamellar structure of montmorillonite via cation replacement and adsorbing the substrate-related bacteria through electrostatic interactions. The water-impermeable property and mucoadhesive ability of montmorillonite endow MOFS with high oral availability and extended retention in the gut. The continuous release of loaded substrates and the formation of biofilms by carried bacteria enable long-term yet efficient synthesis of beneficial metabolites in the intestine, which comprehensively improve gut microbiota composition, suppress intestinal inflammation, and increase the integrity of the gut barrier. In murine models of imbalanced intestinal homeostasis, MOFS demonstrates superior efficacies by alleviating the associated symptoms, even in comparison to clinical therapeutics.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The increasing demand for renewable energy integration and scalable power generation highlights the need for efficient and cost-effective solid oxide fuel cell systems. In this study, we present a modular hybrid design framework that enables flexible solid oxide fuel cell scale-up by interconnecting standardized component modules. We introduce a series-parallel configuration that strategically leverages anode and cathode off-gas recirculation to enhance both electrical and thermal efficiency. Through a detailed case study, we demonstrate that the hybrid design achieves 66.3% electrical efficiency while reducing external water use by 59.9% and fresh air demand by 22%, outperforming conventional system designs. We further conducted a techno-economic analysis across four scale-up strategies and found that the hybrid design delivers the lowest levelized cost of electricity at 0.155 $/kWh. Through this work, we have highlighted the critical trade-offs between centralization and decentralization, high- and low-technology readiness level technologies, and economies of scale versus manufacturing capacity. We believe our findings underscore the potential of modular and standardized systems to provide scalable, efficient, and economically viable solutions for future low-carbon energy infrastructures.",

    "Abstract": "Intestinal glucose excretion, defined as increased intestinal serum glucose uptake and secretion into the lumen, influences bariatric surgery-associated glycaemic control. Here, we investigate molecular mechanisms that activate intestinal glucose excretion. We evaluate altered transcriptomes in variable intestinal glucose excretion models and big data-based drug discovery systems. We show that protein kinase C (PKC) activation mimics transcriptome alterations observed during intestinal glucose excretion. Among PKC subfamilies, atypical PKC (aPKC) facilitates glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)-mediated intestinal glucose excretion without inducing oncogenic proliferation. Intestinal aPKC activation via transposon expression vector induces serum glucose uptake into intestinal tissues and excretion into the lumen. Prostratin, a non-tumorigenic phorbol ester, activates aPKC and induces a similar effect on intestinal glucose excretion. We identify the prostratin and aPKC/GLUT1 signalling pathways as putative targets for treating diabetes, providing insights into the future development of antidiabetic and weight-loss drugs.",

However, coupling luminescent centers with differentiated defect states remains a challenge. Here we report transparent glass ceramics that exhibit photo/thermally dynamic tunable afterglow. A lithium-ion doping-assisted phase separation principle is developed to control the precipitation of defective non-stoichiometric nanocrystals (Zn<sub>1.7</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>: Li) in glass matrix, constructing a biphasic microenvironment with differentiated defect states. The persistent luminescence color can be manipulated by simultaneously engineering the distributions of Mn<sup>2+</sup> activators in the amorphous glass matrix and nanocrystals, and the mechanism is discussed. The developed transparent composites exhibit excellent hardness of up to 10 gigapascal and high thermal stability, which is applicable for harsh conditions.

    "Abstract": "Amorphous porous carbons have been widely used as electrodes for energy storage. However, due to their structural heterogeneity and complex pore topology, the absence of reliable atomic carbon models hinders understanding energy storage mechanisms through molecular simulations. Here, we develop a modeling approach capturing the rich experimental information of small angle X-ray scattering, gas adsorption, and material density, integrating three-dimensional morphology construction with atomic structure generation. Using the built atomic model, constant-potential molecular simulations are performed to investigate the capacitive behavior of amorphous porous carbons, well-validated by experimental measurements of capacitance and impedance. Voronoi sphere analyses uncover the interplay between pore structure and charge storage: ultramicropores (< 0.7 nm) are found to enhance the capacitance through ion exchange, while large micropores (> 0.7 nm) exhibit lower capacitance with negligible ion number change. The charging dynamics are quantified by the proposed multi-scale impedance model, bridging microscopic simulations and macroscopic experiments. This modeling framework paves the way toward molecular understanding of energy storage in amorphous porous materials.",

The integration of semiconducting Zr-MOF and Co-MOF produces interfacial Co and Zr dual sites for NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> activation and CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption, synergistically promoting C-N coupling with reduced energy barriers. Besides, the S-scheme heterojunction enables the strong redox capability and facilitates the charge transfer. Consequently, the rationally designed MOF-on-MOF heterojunction achieves a high urea yield of 3523.4 μg g⁻¹ h⁻¹ and an apparent quantum yield of 1.16% at 365 nm in the absence of sacrificial agents.

    "Abstract": "Hydrocarbons play a key role in shaping the chemistry of the interstellar medium (ISM), but their enrichment and relationship with carbonaceous grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) still lack clear observational constraints. We report JWST NIRSpec+MIRI/MRS infrared (IR; 3-28 micron) observations of the local ultra-luminous IR galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS 07251-0248, revealing the extragalactic detection of small gas-phase hydrocarbons such as benzene (C$_6$H$_6$), triacetylene (C$_6$H$_2$), diacetylene (C$_4$H$_2$), acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$), methane (CH$_4$), and methyl radical (CH$_3$) as well as deep amorphous C-H absorptions in the solid phase. The unexpectedly high abundance of these molecules indicates an extremely rich hydrocarbon chemistry, not explained by high-temperature gas-phase chemistry, ice desorption or oxygen depletion. Instead, the most plausible explanation is the erosion and fragmentation of carbonaceous grains and PAHs. This scenario is supported by the correlation between the abundance of one of their main fragmentation products, C$_2$H$_2$, and cosmic ray (CR) ionization rate for a sample of local ULIRGs. These hydrocarbons are outflowing at $\\sim$160 km/s, which may represent a potential formation pathway for hydrogenated amorphous grains. Our results suggest that IRAS 07251-0248 might not be unique but represents an extreme example of the commonly rich hydrocarbon chemistry prevalent in deeply obscured galactic nuclei.",

    "Abstract": "Accessing high-quality, open-access dermatopathology image datasets for learning and cross-referencing is a common challenge for clinicians and trainees. To establish a comprehensive open-access dermatopathology dataset for educational, cross-referencing, and machine-learning purposes, we employed a hybrid workflow to curate and categorize images from the PubMed Central (PMC) repository. We used specific keywords to extract relevant images, and classified them using a novel hybrid method that combined deep learning-based image modality classification with figure caption analyses. Validation on 651 manually annotated images demonstrated the robustness of our workflow, with an F-score of 89.6% for the deep learning approach, 61.0% for the keyword-based retrieval method, and 90.4% for the hybrid approach. We retrieved over 7,772 images across 166 diagnoses and released this fully annotated dataset, reviewed by board-certified dermatopathologists. Using our dataset as a challenging task, we found the current image analysis algorithm from OpenAI inadequate for analyzing dermatopathology images. In conclusion, we have developed a large, peer-reviewed, open-access dermatopathology image dataset, DermpathNet, which features a semi-automated curation workflow.",

However, its pharmacological effects may vary with the proportions of ingredients and preparatory factors such as the extraction method. Nevertheless, gene expression datasets systematically reflecting these variables are lacking. A total of 513 transcriptome profiles were created with three concentrations and three replicates of RNA-seq data. This dataset structure will enable multidimensional analysis of the effects of various JGT preparation factors on gene expression; these factors include the PR to GR proportional ratio (2:1, 1:1, and 1:2), solvent (water or 70% ethanol), and extraction method (combined or individual extraction method). The HepG2, C2C12, and PC12 cell lines were targeted. All raw and preprocessed data are available through GEO. Standardized metadata and ingredient data are also provided. This dataset provides a foundation for exploring traditional herbal formulations effects on cellular transcriptomic responses and can facilitate the scientific optimization of herbal medicines.",

    "Abstract": "Electrocardiography is a cornerstone in the diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases; however, accurate interpretation demands expert knowledge and is often impeded by data scarcity and annotation costs. To address these challenges, we propose SimCardioNet, a hybrid self-supervised and supervised deep learning framework for multi-class electrocardiography image classification. SimCardioNet leverages a custom multi-scale convolutional neural network backbone enhanced with residual connections and multi-head self-attention, pretrained via a modified SimCLR contrastive learning strategy that integrates a hybrid loss combining InfoNCE and cosine similarity. Following self-supervised pretraining, the model undergoes supervised fine-tuning with progressive layer unfreezing to mitigate overfitting and preserve meaningful representations. We evaluate SimCardioNet across three distinct ECG image datasets: (1) a 4-class Pakistani clinical ECG dataset (Dataset I), (2) an external Kaggle electrocardiography dataset for out-of-distribution validation (Dataset II), and (3) the large-scale PTB-XL benchmark (Dataset III) covering five diagnostic superclasses. On Dataset I, SimCardioNet achieves 0.975 accuracy, 0.973 precision, 0.973 recall, and 0.972 F1-score under 3-fold cross-validation. On Dataset II, the model demonstrates perfect classification performance (1.00 accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score), highlighting strong generalization. On the PTB-XL dataset (Dataset III), SimCardioNet attains 0.921 accuracy and 0.921 F1-score, outperforming current state-of-the-art models including dual-branch CNNs, entropy-enhanced CNNs, and Bi-GRU architectures. Ablation studies confirm the critical contributions of self-supervised pretraining, attention mechanisms, and domain-specific augmentations. Grad-CAM visualizations further validate the model's focus on clinically relevant Electrocardiography regions. Our results underscore SimCardioNet's potential to reduce reliance on labeled data while delivering robust, interpretable, and clinically viable Electrocardiography classification especially valuable in resource-constrained settings.",

    "Abstract": "Bladder rupture repair surgery is limited by its long duration, significant blood loss, and complex procedures. Biological welding technology, which integrates multiple functions such as cutting, hemostasis, and tissue fusion, has shown potential in the field of soft tissue repair surgery but has not yet been widely explored in clinical applications for bladder rupture repair. This study used 32 adult male Beagle dogs to establish a bladder rupture model, randomly assigned to the biological welding group or the traditional suturing group. Outcomes assessed included surgical time, blood loss, postoperative inflammation, and hematuria. Histopathological analysis and RNA sequencing analysis were performed at multiple postoperative time points to evaluate the tissue recovery process and repair mechanisms. The results demonstrated that biological welding significantly reduced surgical time (21.80 ± 4.79 min vs. 75.15 ± 13.26 min, p < 0.001) and intraoperative blood loss (6.37 ± 0.89 g vs. 30.36 ± 6.59 g, p < 0.001) compared to traditional suturing. Postoperative complications, such as hematuria and inflammatory response, were notably lower in the biological welding group. Histopathological analysis revealed enhanced cell migration and tissue fusion in the biological welding group, leading to accelerated bladder healing and reduced adhesions. Transcriptomic sequencing indicated that biological welding activated a limited number of immune-related genes and signaling pathways in the early postoperative period, facilitating rapid repair and a shorter duration of abnormal gene expression. Our research indicates that biological welding technology demonstrates significant advantages in bladder rupture repair surgery, including enhanced surgical efficiency, reduced incidence of postoperative complications, and accelerated tissue healing process, with broad prospects for clinical application.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The modified Camassa–Holm (MCH) equation is a significant mathematical model for describing nonlinear wave phenomena, especially in shallow water dynamics and related physical systems. Although various analytical techniques have been applied to such nonlinear equations, many difficulties have arisen in producing a wide variety of exact and structurally rich solutions. This study addresses this gap by employing the modified (G′/G)-expansion (MG′/GE) method to construct an extensive range of exact traveling wave solutions for the MCH framework, such as trigonometric, hyperbolic, and rational solutions. Numerous waveforms, including single singular, double singular, multiple bright, multiple dark, multiple singular, and singular solitons, have been found to have solutions for the MCH framework. These waveforms have numerous applications in applied sciences and engineering. The structural properties and propagation dynamics of the resulting solutions are successfully depicted by graphics such as 3D, contour, density, 2D time-evolution, and 3D revolving plots. Compared to other existing approaches, such as the sine–cosine method and the tanh method, the MG’/GE approach is substantially more accurate and adaptable. The MG’/GE technique’s durability and computing efficiency allow it to generate precise findings straightforwardly. Its broad variety of applications in nonlinear system analysis is further highlighted by its expansion to fractional-order equations. In addition to laying the foundation for future research on traveling wave phenomena in many scientific domains, the current study presents an analytical scheme for both classical and fractional nonlinear evolution equations (NLEEs).",

    "Abstract": "Tendinopathy is a common musculoskeletal condition that impairs body function and quality of life. Extracorporeal shockwave therapy is a widely used non-invasive treatment method. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and safety of radial shockwave therapy (RSWT) and focused shockwave therapy (FSWT) in the treatment of upper and lower limb tendinopathies, based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing pain intensity, physical function, muscle strength, and adverse effects. The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database under the registration number CRD420251011209. A comprehensive search of PubMed, EBSCOhost, Ovid MEDLINE, and Embase was conducted to identify RCTs. Databases were searched from their inception until the last update-26 March 2025 for PubMed, EBSCOhost and Ovid MEDLINE, and 27 March 2025 for Embase. Review methods: Risk ratios and mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic. The risk of bias and methodological quality of the included studies were evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. The overall quality of the body of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Of the 102 records identified, 9 articles met the inclusion criteria, comprising a total of 530 patients with upper or lower limb tendinopathy. No clear superiority of RSWT or FSWT was observed for pain or functional outcomes, owing to low or very low certainty of evidence. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that RSWT significantly improved wrist extensor strength in patients with tennis elbow compared to FSWT (MD: 1.81; 95% CI 0.97 to 2.64; p < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), while grip strength did not differ significantly between the modalities (MD: 0.57; 95% CI -1.68 to 2.82; p = 0.62; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Both treatments were similarly safe, but conclusions are limited by low-quality evidence.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Invasive freshwater turtles are major drivers of biodiversity loss, underscoring the importance of early detection and management. However, it is challenging for experts to manually monitor a broad geographic area, necessitating support tools. Deep learning-based object detection models have displayed high performance in automating wildlife monitoring tasks. Furthermore, hyperparameter optimization, including optimizer selection and hyperparameter tuning, might further enhance performance by optimizing training settings to the dataset. In this study, an optimized model was developed to apply hyperparameter optimization to detect and classify six invasive turtle species in Korea from images. The optimized model was compared to a default model trained using the default optimizer and hyperparameters. The optimized model outperformed the default model, as indicated by the evaluations of mean average precision using a fixed intersection over union threshold of 0.5 (0.973 vs. 0.959) and a range of thresholds ranging from 0.5 to 0.95 (0.841 vs. 0.815). The classification accuracy of the optimized model reached 92.7%, exceeding that of the default model (89.9%). These findings highlight the utility of hyperparameter optimization and suggest that the proposed approach can support the early detection of invasive turtles, thereby enhancing to invasive species management.",

    "Abstract": "There has been an increasing interest in investigating the mechanical properties of cellular materials that are designed based on triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) and spinodal decomposition, but there have been no studies on comprehensively estimating and comparing their effective anisotropic properties. This study numerically investigates the effective anisotropic elastic properties and thermal conductivity of stochastic-TPMS and spinodal cellular materials using the finite element method. Both sheet- and ligament-based stochastic-TPMS and spinodal cellular materials are considered and compared with periodic TPMS lattices. The spinodal cellular materials are designed using the Gaussian random field (GRF) approach, whereas stochastic TPMS cellular materials are designed using different TPMS topologies by stochastically rotating the unit-cells within randomly distributed control volumes. Periodic sheet- and ligament-based cellular materials have demonstrated superior thermal conductivity and elastic characteristics compared to their stochastic counterparts at lower relative densities. Nevertheless, when the relative density increases, the stochastic sheet- and ligament-based cellular materials have exhibited these properties that are similar to their periodic equivalents. Ligament-based cellular materials have exhibited inferior thermal conductivity and elastic properties compared to sheet-based cellular materials of the same relative density. Moreover, sheet- and ligament-based stochastic cellular materials are found to have better isotropic characteristics compared to periodic cellular materials. Our research demonstrates that stochastic TPMS-based design process can yield stochastic cellular materials with enhanced elastic characteristics when suitable topology is employed, in comparison to spinodal cellular materials. This study helps in providing guidelines to adopting the best topologies of current metamaterials for certain applications.",

This study presents an integrated analytical framework that combines dynamic land use modeling, the Geo-detector method (GDM), and Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) to analyze land use transition and carbon emission dynamics in China's Pearl River Delta (PRD) from 2000 to 2020. Key findings include: (1) Construction land expansion was the dominant explicit transition, with land conversion sources shifting from cropland-centric patterns to diverse transfers involving woodland and water bodies. (2) The implicit land use transition index exhibited an annual growth rate of 15.6%, progressing through three phases-rapid development (2000-2010), structural adjustment (2010-2015), and high-quality transition (2015-2020). (3) Regional carbon emissions increased by 186.96%, exhibiting spatial disparities between core and peripheral regions. Construction land expansion and GDP density were primary drivers. This research advances the theoretical integration of land system science and low-carbon governance, offering actionable insights for spatially differentiated emission reduction strategies in megacity clusters.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Psoriasis is a persistent inflammatory dermatological disorder characterized by dysregulated hyperproliferation of keratinocytes and pathological immune cell infiltration, impacting a significant population globally. Conventional systemic therapies, including oral and injectable formulations, are often limited by adverse off-target effects, which limit their utility in long-term clinical management. To address this challenge, we developed a soluble bilayered microneedle patch (Methotrexate and dexamethasone co-loaded bilayer microneedles, MTX@DXM-MNs), which consists of an outer layer of gelatine-polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel loaded with dexamethasone (DXM) and an inner layer of aminocrystallized hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel loaded with methotrexate (MTX). The patch successfully traversed imiquimod (IMQ)-induced thickened epidermis in murine models to achieve intralesional drug delivery and effectively alleviate psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Versus tacrolimus ointment (positive control), MTX@DXM-MNs markedly alleviated the manifestations of stratum corneum thickening, erythema, and scaling in a mouse model and attenuated the levels of inflammatory mediators in skin tissues and peripheral blood as well as splenic indices. In conclusion, the MTX@DXM-MN bilayered microneedle patch provides a new strategy for the efficient and safe treatment of psoriasis through the temporal and spatial synergistic effects of an outer layer for the immediate release of a hormone and an inner layer for the slow release of an immunosuppressant. Thus, this patch has potential as a future clinical alternative for the treatment of psoriasis.",

This study examines changes in psychosomatic symptoms among school-aged children using nationally representative data from the Hungarian Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) survey, collected in 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, and 2022 (N = 37,930; M age = 14.88 years, SD age = 2.36 years; boys = 49.3%). Descriptive statistics, logistic regression analyses, and ANCOVAs were conducted to assess trends from 2002 to 2022. Girls and older adolescents reported more symptoms overall, with 2022 showing the highest prevalence across all symptom categories in both genders. The proportion of adolescents reporting multiple health complaints (MHC) (excluding fatigue) became considerably more common between 2010 and 2022, increasing from 40.6 to 65.6% among girls, and from 30.2 to 42% among boys. Fatigue emerged as the most reported frequent symptom across all survey waves among both genders, peaking in 2022 at 47.5% among boys and 67.6% among girls. The findings point to a trajectory—particularly in recent years—highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions and policy actions to support adolescent health.",

    "Abstract": "Microbial communities inhabiting the plant phyllosphere play an important role in plant health, yet their responses to agricultural chemicals remain understudied. Understanding the effect of fungicides is crucial for developing sustainable disease management strategies that preserve beneficial microbial diversity alongside effective pathogen control. This study aimed to characterise the yeast community associated with winter wheat leaves and to assess its sensitivity to fungicides used in conventional agriculture. A total of 34 yeast species were identified from 454 isolates, with 98% belonging to the phylum Basidiomycota. Sporobolomyces roseus was the dominant species, while Vishniacozyma spp. and Rhodotorula babjevae were also frequent. During the vegetation period, the abundance of three species exhibited temporal variation. Fungicide sensitivity profiling revealed that non-target yeasts were more sensitive than Zymoseptoria tritici, the pathogen responsible for septoria tritici blotch, to commonly applied fungicides such as mefentrifluconazole, prothioconazole-desthio, pyraclostrobin, and azoxystrobin. In contrast, fenpicoxamid exhibited the lowest off-target effect while remaining highly active against Z. tritici. These findings highlight the ecological complexity of the wheat phyllosphere and the potential unintended consequences of fungicide use.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Accurate estimation of State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH) in lithium-ion batteries is critical for effective Battery Management Systems (BMS). A key factor in enhancing estimation accuracy is the appropriate selection of the Open-Circuit Voltage (OCV-SOC) model. This study investigates two prevalent methods for OCV modeling: the Low-Current (LC) method and the Incremental Current (IC) method, and evaluates their impact on the performance of the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for SOC estimation and instantaneous internal resistance (R 0 ) tracking. In this work, SOH is primarily assessed through R 0 ​, which is adopted as the main degradation indicator under dynamic operating conditions. The dynamic model employed is an Equivalent Circuit Model (ECM) of a lithium-ion battery, with estimations conducted using real-world driving data (Federal Urban Driving Schedule, FUDS). The results demonstrate that the IC method, due to its higher local resolution in the OCV modeling, achieves faster convergence and higher estimation accuracy for SOC, particularly when the initial SOC is subject to error. In contrast, the LC method, despite its experimental simplicity, exhibits significant errors in the early stages of simulation due to excessive smoothing of the OCV curve. Furthermore, a comparison of R 0 trends reveals that the IC method provides a more consistent and stable estimation, whereas the LC method shows greater short-term fluctuations and reduced stability. This difference is attributed to the higher accuracy of the OCV curve in the IC method. Ultimately, the choice of the OCV extraction method directly influences the accuracy and stability of SOC estimation and SOH analysis based on R 0 tracking.",

    "Abstract": "Against the backdrop of global industrial chain restructuring and heightened uncertainty risks, enhancing supply chain resilience is central to ensuring high-quality development in manufacturing. Drawing on microdata from Chinese A-share manufacturing listed companies from 2011 to 2024, this study empirically examines the impact of corporate digital transformation on manufacturing supply chain resilience and its underlying mechanisms. Findings reveal: First, corporate digital transformation exerts a significant and robust direct positive effect on manufacturing supply chain resilience, a conclusion that holds after multiple endogeneity tests including time window shortening and instrumental variables methods. Second, mechanism tests indicate that digital transformation indirectly enhances supply chain resilience through two mediating pathways: alleviating financing constraints and reducing market competition intensity. Specifically, digital transformation enhances corporate information transparency and operational efficiency, thereby reducing external financing costs and alleviating excessive market competition pressures. This creates a more favorable financial and market environment for strengthening supply chain resilience. Third, heterogeneity analysis reveals significant industry differences in the enabling effects of digital transformation, with its promotional impact being particularly pronounced in high-tech, low-pollution, and highly competitive industries. This study provides micro-level evidence for understanding the dual \"financial-market\" pathways through which digital transformation empowers manufacturing resilience. It offers important implications for formulating targeted digital transformation policies, optimizing corporate financing environments, and guiding healthy market competition to systematically strengthen supply chain resilience.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The clinical deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for assessing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) is hindered by limitations in interpretability and explainability. To address this, we present xGNN4MI, an open-source framework for graph neural networks (GNNs) in ECG modeling for interpretable CVD prediction. Our framework facilitates modeling clinically relevant spatial relationships between ECG leads and their temporal dynamics. We integrated explainable AI (XAI) and developed a task-specific XAI evaluation and visualization workflow to identify ECG leads crucial to the model’s decision-making process, enabling a systematic comparison with established clinical knowledge. We evaluated xGNN4MI on two challenging tasks: diagnostic superclass classification and localization of myocardial infarction. Our findings show that the interpretable ECG-GNN models demonstrate good performance across the tasks. XAI analysis revealed clinically meaningful training effects, such as differentiating between anteroseptal and inferior myocardial infarction. Our work demonstrates the potential of ECG-GNNs for providing trustworthy and interpretable AI-based CVD diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "Cells throughout physiological and pathological contexts are exposed to a broad spectrum of mechanical stimuli, triggering extensive nuclear deformation and chromatin remodeling. These mechanical cues drive the cell to dynamically adapt through coordinated structural, epigenetic, and biochemical mechanisms to withstand mechanical stress while protecting genomic integrity. However, whether such cellular adaptations are reversible or result in persistent alterations remains unresolved. In cancer metastasis, addressing this issue is critical: confined migration through narrow pores prompts chromatin condensation with heterochromatin enrichment, yet cancer cells must preserve their oncogenic potential while preparing for future deformations. Therefore, the ability of these cells to reconcile reversible chromatin remodeling and mechanical memory could be key to metastatic resilience. Here, using a custom-designed microfluidic device to monitor single-cell chromatin reorganization, we show confined migration induces partially-reversible chromatin condensation: total highly-condensed chromatin content is recovered after deformation, but the distribution of condensed chromatin clusters remains altered. Our findings highlight this duality of chromatin condensation as both a short-term adaptive response and a mechanical memory strategy, which could potentially contribute to address cancer invasiveness.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Epigenetic modulators may sensitize platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) to immune checkpoint inhibition by reprogramming the tumor microenvironment. Methods We report clinical and translational findings from a phase II non-randomized study of pembrolizumab and oral azacitidine in 34 women with PROC (NCT02900560). Key eligibility criteria included age 18 years or older, performance status of 0–1, measurable disease, platinum-resistant disease and histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube carcinoma or primary peritoneal carcinoma. Primary endpoints included safety, tolerability, overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). Secondary endpoints included CA-125 response. The effect of combined epigenetic and immunotherapy was evaluated by transcriptomic analyses of 72 serially biopsied tumors. Results We show that the combination is moderately well tolerated and most common grade 3–4 adverse events are gastrointestinal side effects and anemia. ORR is 2.9% and DCR is 50%; with 3 of the 27 evaluable patients attaining a CA-125 response. Differential gene expression analyses reveal an upregulation of inflammatory and cytolytic genes and co-inhibitory checkpoints 6 weeks on-therapy. Upregulation of interferon signaling, antigen presentation and immune cell adhesion and migration gene sets are prominent on-therapy, together with an increase in density of CD8 + T-cells. Patients with a CA-125 and/or clinical response show an enrichment of adaptive and conserved immune response gene sets on-therapy. Conclusions Our findings highlight the potential of epigenetic modulators to re-shape the tumor microenvironment of PROC toward a more inflammed phenotype and may point to approaches to augment immunotherapy response.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Natural disturbances are major drivers of tropical forest dynamics, yet their role in Central Africa’s old-growth rainforests, the world’s second largest tropical forest block, remains poorly quantified. Here we present the first regional assessment of windthrow, the uprooting or breakage of trees by wind. Using Landsat imagery from 2019 to 2020, we detected 74 windthrow events ≥30 ha, collectively affecting ~18,600 ha. These events were concentrated in eastern regions where mesoscale convective systems and extreme rainfall are most frequent. Sizes of windthrow events followed a Weibull distribution, with a single 3974 ha event accounting for one fifth of the total affected area. Event orientations aligned with prevailing storm outflows, and their timing coincided with peaks in extreme rainfall. For a subset of seven events with adequate temporal coverage before and after disturbance, near-infrared reflectance returned to pre-disturbance levels within months, indicating a rapid vegetation regrowth. Together, these findings show that windthrow is an important disturbance agent in Central Africa and must be considered in assessments of forest resilience under intensifying storm regimes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical contexts; however, existing benchmarks often fail to reflect the real-world complexity of low-resource health systems accurately. Here we develop a dataset of 5,609 clinical questions contributed by 101 community health workers across 4 Rwandan districts and compared responses generated by 5 LLMs (Gemini-2, GPT-4o, o3-mini, Deepseek R1 and Meditron-70B) with those from local clinicians. A subset of 524 question–answer pairs was evaluated using a rubric of 11 expert-rated metrics, scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Gemini-2 and GPT-4o were the best performers (achieving mean scores of 4.49 and 4.48 out of 5, respectively, across all 11 metrics). All LLMs significantly outperformed local clinicians ( P &lt; 0.001) across all metrics, with Gemini-2, for example, surpassing local general practitioners by an average of 0.83 points on every metric (range 0.38–1.10). Although performance degraded slightly when LLMs communicated in Kinyarwanda, the LLMs remained superior to clinicians and were over 500 times cheaper per response. These findings support the potential of LLMs to strengthen frontline care quality in low-resource, multilingual health systems.",

    "Abstract": "Polyethyleneimine (PEI)-functionalized nanochannels have been extensively exploited in ion gating and biosensing. It is of great significance to explore their conductance determining ion–surface interaction and ionic transport at the nanoscale. Here, pH-regulated conductance of PEI-coated nanochannels is theoretically studied. The results suggest that coating PEI may improve nanochannel conductance in different ways depending on the surface charge of nanochannels. The conductance of a PEI-coated PET nanochannel whose surface charge is assumed to be constant for simplicity is weakly changed and then decreased to that of a non-PEI-coated PET nanochannel with increasing pH, which is consistent with the reported experimental results. The conductance of a PEI-coated silica nanochannel, whose surface charge largely depends on pH, ion concentration, and nanochannel radius, is significantly increased and, subsequently, decreased to that of a non-PEI-coated silica nanochannel as pH rises, which is rarely reported in experiments. This work provides a fundamental framework to investigate the conductance of PEI-coated nanochannels, and the PEI-coated silica nanochannels with unique pH-dependent conductance may be explored in the construction of mesoporous silica thin films for biomedical analytical applications.",

    "Abstract": "Combining classical density functional theory (cDFT) with quantum mechanics (QM) methods offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional QM/molecular mechanics (MM) approaches for modeling mixed quantum-classical systems at finite temperatures. However, both QM/MM and QM/cDFT rely on somewhat ambiguous approximations, the two major ones being: (i) the definition of the QM and MM regions as well as the description of their coupling, and (ii) the choice of the methods and levels of approximation made to describe each region. This paper addresses the second point and develops an exact theoretical framework that allows us to clarify the approximations involved in the QM/cDFT formulation. We, therefore, establish a comprehensive density functional theory (DFT) framework for mixed quantum-classical systems within the canonical ensemble. We start by recalling the expression of the adiabatic equilibrium density matrix for a mixed system made of Nqm quantum and Nmm classical particles, which can be related to a partial Wigner transform. Then, we propose a variational formulation of the Helmholtz free energy in terms of the full, non-equilibrium, QM/MM density matrix. Taking advantage of permutational symmetry and thanks to constrained-search methods, we reformulate the computation of the Helmholtz free energy using only the quantum and classical one-body densities. Therefore, this paper generalizes both cDFT and electronic DFT (eDFT) to QM/MM systems. We then reformulate the functional to make the standard eDFT and cDFT Levy–Lieb functionals explicitly appear, together with a new universal correlation functional for QM/MM systems. A mean-field approximation is finally introduced in the context of solvation problems, and we discuss its connection with several existing mixed cDFT-eDFT schemes. An extension to the semi-grand canonical ensemble, where the number of classical particles is allowed to fluctuate, is provided in the supplementary material.",

    "Abstract": "Singlet Fission (SF) into two triplets offers exciting avenues for high-efficiency photovoltaics and optically initializable qubits. While the chemical space of SF chromophores is ever-expanding, the underlying mechanistic details of electronic-nuclear motions accompanying SF are often glossed over. Rigid SF dimers with well-defined orientations are helpful to decipher such details. Here, using polarization-controlled white-light two-dimensional and pump–probe spectroscopies, we investigate a new class of contorted naphthalenediimide dimers, recently reported to have a favorable intramolecular SF (iSF) pathway. 2D cross-peaks directly identify the two Davydov components of the dimer. 2D maps reveal that excitation of either Davydov component leads to an intermediate state, which is generated within our instrument response. This intermediate proceeds to form a relaxed TT1 state whose formation kinetics is strongly dependent on which Davydov component is excited. We also find that the intermediate formation and relaxation are vibronically coherent with enhanced quantum beats only in the TT1 photoproduct, suggesting that intermolecular twisting and ruffling coordinates are strongly displaced upon TT1 formation. Polarization anisotropy directly tracks electronic motion during these steps and curiously reveals minimal electronic reorientation during TT1 formation. A likely hypothesis for this observation is that significantly mixed singlet–triplet electronic character is maintained throughout the nuclear evolution away from the Franck–Condon geometry toward relaxed TT1 without any reduction in the singlet electronic character. Such a mixing can introduce triplet annihilation channels and can therefore prevent the formation of long-lived high-spin triplets. The synthetic design of iSF dimers should aim to minimize this electronic mixing.",

    "Abstract": "A simple fourth-order propagator [Ture and Jang, J. Phys. Chem. A 128, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of fourth-order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven Λ-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter–radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open-system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our sixth-order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other fourth-order algorithms for the Λ-system. These confirm reasonable performance of our simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.",

    "Abstract": "Pitfall trapping projects at Dhilba Guuranda-Innes National Park in South Australia from 2004 to 2011 resulted in the capture of many Western Pygmy-Possums Cercartetus concinnus. Reviewing the photographs of some of the captured animals, we discovered two possible Little Pygmy-Possums Cercartetus lepidus, captured in December 2006. Although the range extension needs to be formally demonstrated by collecting specimens or tissues, this discovery is extraordinary considering subfossil deposits for the Yorke Peninsula have not revealed C. lepidus. This species is threatened in South Australia and the possible existence of a relict population on the southern Yorke Peninsula requires attention. We recommend the urgent survey of the area for this species, possibly with the help of nest boxes that exclude C. concinnus, and the cessation of prescribed burning or other activities causing vegetation fragmentation until the impacts of these activities on C. lepidus are understood.",

    "Abstract": "Context: Traditional breeding methods have achieved limited success in improving drought tolerance in rice due to the complex quantitative nature of the trait. However, modern approaches such as marker-assisted breeding (MAB) have enabled the development of drought-resilient varieties. Aim: Given the popularity of ADT (R) 45 and its susceptibility to drought, this study aimed to introgress three drought-yield QTLs qDTY1.1, qDTY3.1, and qDTY12.1 into ADT (R) 45 using marker-assisted backcross breeding, and to identify promising drought-tolerant versions through both genotyping and phenotyping. Methods: Backcrossing was conducted using F1s of ADT (R) 45 crossed with Apo and Way Rarem. Resulting BC3F1 and intermated populations (BC2F1 of ADT (R) 45/Way Rarem // BC2F1 of ADT (R) 45/Apo) were advanced to BC3F2 and intermated F2, followed by BC3F3 and intermated F3 generations. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) was applied in BC3F2 and intermated F2 to identify superior backcross inbred lines (BILs). Key Results: Sixteen BILs showed more than 10 per cent yield gain under both moderate and severe stress. BILs I85 and W61 showed superior physiological traits such as higher relative water content, SPAD value, proline content, and better recovery under drought. Conclusion &amp;amp; Implications: BIL I85 showed best score for leaf rolling, leaf drying, drought recovery as well as higher SPAD value and proline content. While BIL W61 exhibited higher values for SPAD, relative water content, proline content and leaf drying score. These two BILs were also found to possess more than 10 per cent single plant yield over recurrent parent ADT (R) 45. Implications These two BILS are therefore considered for further trials at the national and state levels, and the most promising one will be selected for release as a high-yielding drought-tolerant variety.",

    "Abstract": "Many individuals likely struggle with patience on a daily or even hourly basis, but the empirical study of patience as a personality trait is still emerging. Recent theoretical work articulates patience as a trait (i.e., as a tendency to react in a particular way in particular context) and differentiates it from the regulation of patience (i.e., as one pathway toward patient reactions). We present the Patient Reaction (P-React) scale and the Patience Regulation (P-Reg) scale to address conceptual and practical limitations of existing assessments related to those constructs. Across 11 samples with nearly 2,000 unique participants (including student and non-student participants), we found that both scales had strong psychometric properties and produced validity correlations that corresponded strongly with a priori hypotheses based on the recent theoretical accounts of the constructs. Two forms of each scale were developed and are essentially psychometrically identical, facilitating their complementary use and their use in repeated-assessment contexts. We believe that the new scales will help advance research regarding important and commonly experienced constructs that have been surprisingly understudied to date.",

This scoping review aimed to conceptualize current knowledge about educational interventions for developing EI in medical education. <b>Methods</b>: This study adopted the first five stages of Levac et al.'s scoping review framework, which builds on Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review methodology. The authors accessed three databases-PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO-to review the literature from 2014 to February 2025. Two authors (WI and TS) independently screened the literature for eligibility. A third author (BAAW) resolved any discrepancies. Two authors (WI and BAAW) charted the eligible articles. <b>Results</b>: Of the 638 studies, 64 were eligible. Approximately one-third of eligible studies focused on interventions for medical students. Stress management, leadership, communication, and professionalism were key topics integrated into EI development interventions. Various methods were employed, such as small-group discussions, case-based discussions, and simulations. Most studies used self-rating questionnaires as assessment tools. Half of the studies (56.25%) reported positive impacts from their interventions. <b>Conclusions</b>: The findings could serve as a guide for educators and researchers seeking to implement or study such interventions.",

    "Abstract": "Under expert surgical technique with optimised perioperative protocols, EC-IC bypass achieves exceptional safety profiles with complication rates substantially lower than previous major trials. The dramatic reduction from the historical 15% to 0.8% perioperative stroke rates demonstrates that surgical excellence and protocol optimisation can transform outcomes in cerebral revascularisation. These findings suggest that the poor results in previous trials may reflect technical and management factors rather than fundamental procedure limitations, warranting reconsideration of EC-IC bypass for carefully selected patients, particularly those with CMCAO.",

    "Abstract": "This review synthesizes the neurobiological basis of sleep-like states and circadian rhythm mechanisms observed in teleost fish. Fish exhibit a complex biological organisation in terms of sleep and circadian rhythms, neuroendocrine regulation, behavioural adaptation, and interaction with environmental stimuli. Sleep is expressed in many fish species as sleep-like states characterised by behavioural indicators such as decreased motor activity, increased response threshold to external stimuli, and rapid reversibility. This process is regulated by both homeostatic sleep pressure and the circadian clock, which is sensitive to the light-dark cycle. Sleep deprivation in fish negatively affects cognitive performance by causing impairments in learning, memory consolidation, and synaptic plasticity processes. Furthermore, differences in sleep duration and responses to sleep homeostasis across species suggest that sleep physiology has been shaped by ecological and evolutionary adaptations. Thus, fish provide a powerful platform for elucidating the molecular architecture of circadian regulation and for exploring how environmental stressors influence neural function and behavior.",

    "Abstract": "Individuals with significant communication and physical impairments often rely on augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) to facilitate independent communication across a range of communication partners and settings. Due to physical impairments, many individuals require alternate methods to access AAC systems, known as access technologies. While access technologies have advanced, they remain considerably slower than verbal communication. This scoping review explored recent advances in access technologies published between 2019 and 2024, focusing on technologies that facilitate communication speed and/or accuracy for individuals of any age with physical disabilities. Forty-six studies met inclusion criteria, covering a range of technologies such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), eye-tracking technology, and novel applications, such as a mixed reality AAC environment and multimodal access approaches (e.g., integrated eye-tracking with switch scanning, hybrid BCI eye-tracking). Despite technological progress, fewer than one-third of studies addressed the role of communication partners in setup and support, highlighting a gap in user-centred design. Findings are discussed in terms of practical applications and emerging directions for technology development. Implications for clinical practice and future research include the need for inclusive design, improved usability, and greater consideration of communication partner involvement in AAC access solutions.",

    "Abstract": "A dementia-friendly community (DFC) is a place where people living with dementia (PLWD) and family carers' rights are supported and communities value their input. Many developed countries have social policies to address the discrimination and stigma faced by PLWD and to support their interest in continuing to live in their homes and communities. This exploratory, micro-ethnographic case study research examined micro-processes in two committees established to build DFCs in Australia. Data were derived from participant observation, field notes, and 16 interviews with DFC committee members. Findings highlight two key learnings. First, active engagement requires meeting the rights of PLWD to have a voice, be heard, and hold power in committees. Second, recognizing how positioning PLWD as consumers or leaders affects participation and inclusion. From our analyses and insights gained, we propose how a dialogical community development approach could improve local initiatives through interpersonal relationships and actions as well as explicit reflection and discussion of how professionals can facilitate or constrain inclusive and participatory practices among PLWD.",

We recruited 46 HCM patients and 49 controls, and measured biomarkers levels using ELISA. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed the highest diagnostic sensitivity for MMP-2 (93.3%) and specificity for TGF-β (90%). Significant correlations were found between biomarkers and clinical parameters, including interactions between TGF-β and left ventricular mass, MMP-2 and intraventricular septum, PIIINP and maximal wall thickness. We suggest that TGF-β, with the highest specificity and MMP-2, with high sensitivity, may offer significant potential for identifying patients with HCM and serve as useful biomarkers for this disease.",

    "Abstract": "Thunderstorm weather and elevated pollen concentrations significantly impact the risk of respiratory allergic diseases, including thunderstorm asthma (TA). We investigated the effect of pollen concentration on outpatient visits for respiratory allergic diseases during thunderstorm events using meteorological, pollen, and allergy clinic data from Yulin City, Shaanxi Province, China (2020-2022). We employed a generalized additive model (GAM) and Poisson regression to analyze these data. Our results indicate that lightning activity can increase the exposure risk among susceptible individuals by raising pollen concentrations on the day of thunderstorm occurrence and for the subsequent 2 days. Daytime Lightning has a more pronounced effect on TA incidence. Further analysis of lightning parameters - current intensity, return-strike steepness, number of flashes, and flash distance - revealed that the relative risk of pollen concentration on TA is higher under conditions of low current intensity and high return-strike steepness. Additionally, diurnal analysis demonstrated that daytime lightning events have a greater impact on TA compared to those occurring at night. These findings are critical for the development of public health strategies and early warning systems. They can assist relevant authorities in implementing preventive measures before and after thunderstorms to mitigate TA events.",

The HIGS provides rehabilitation professionals with a valid tool to identify grief reactions in return-to-work assessments, enabling recognition of employees who may require support that addresses both health-related and anticipated work-related losses.",

    "Abstract": "Given calls for greater attention to culture in interpersonal health communication research, we interviewed 29 South Asian women between the ages of 18 and 60 managing chronic health issues to explore culturally specific dilemmas in health-related talk within families. Guided by normative rhetorical theory, our findings narrate polysemic meanings of health as generational, communal, and personal. These meanings created dilemmas centered on what it means to care and for whom, with women describing discursive challenges in privileging their own health without dishonoring their (grand)mothers' health experiences, disrupting family harmony, or neglecting their duties and obligations. In response, women adopted different interpretive lenses to embrace the both/and nature of their membership in multiple cultures of care. Findings have implications for interpersonal and health communication theory, highlighting how fractures in cultural norms manifest as discrete interactional dilemmas in everyday communication about health in families.",

    "Abstract": "Avenanthramides (AVAs), unique polyphenols in oats, have received much attention due to their biologically beneficial properties. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and molecular docking were performed to elucidate the structure-antioxidant capacity relationship and underlying mechanism of A-type AVAs under physiological conditions. Further, the interaction effects between AVAs and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) for activating the Nrf2-ARE (nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2-antioxidant response element) signaling pathway were explored. The results showed that the representative A-type AVA 2cd displayed excellent HOO<sup>•</sup> scavenging capacity in water at physiological pH with an overall rate constant (<i>k</i><sub>overall</sub> = 2.97 × 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) higher than that of reference antioxidants Trolox and BHT, while moderate capacity in lipid-like media. Formal hydrogen atom transfer (fHAT) mechanism is more favored in lipid media, whereas in aqueous solution at physiological pH, the hydrogen transfer from dianion species plays a dominant role (99.4%) in the overall reactivity. The results also highlighted the effects of central double bond, hydroxyl, carboxyl and solvents in antiradical processes. Molecular docking and DFT calculations showed that <b>2c</b> and <b>2c<sub>d</sub></b> can bind strongly to Keap1 through hydrogen bonding and cysteine residues based covalent binding, which disrupts the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction. Collectively, <b>2c</b> and <b>2c<sub>d</sub></b> are promising candidates as multifunctional antioxidant with radical trapping and Nrf2 activation effects.",

    "Abstract": "Chromium (Cr), classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a carcinogen, poses significant risks to human health. This study evaluated the uptake of Cr in <i>Arachis hypogaea</i>, <i>Vigna unguiculata</i>, and <i>Zea mays</i> cultivated in Cr-contaminated soils and assessed the associated toxicological risks to human consumers. A greenhouse experiment was conducted using soils contaminated with Cr at 10 and 30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Chromium concentrations in soils and plant tissues were quantified using ICP-OES, and bioconcentration and translocation factors (TFs) were determined to assess Cr uptake and movement within the plants. The lifetime incremental cancer risk (ILCR) was determined to evaluate potential long-term health risks. Results showed that all three species accumulated significant amounts of Cr in roots and aerial tissues, with bioconcentration factors (BFs) greater than one in most treatments. However, TFs remained below or equal to one for most cases, indicating limited upward movement of Cr. Importantly, ILCR values were within permissible limits, suggesting no significant carcinogenic risk for consuming these crops. These findings indicate that <i>A. hypogaea</i>, <i>V. unguiculata</i>, and <i>Z. mays</i> are resistant to Cr contamination and can be safely cultivated and consumed in soils containing up to 30 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of Cr. This study provides valuable insights for ecotoxicological risks and for the safe management of Cr-contaminated agricultural soils in Mozambican industrial areas.",

    "Abstract": "Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumours with the highest incidence rate and mortality in the world, among which non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for a relatively high proportion. Patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer who cannot be surgically resected usually receive radiotherapy, but the effectiveness of a single treatment is limited. The results indicate that radiotherapy combined with immunotherapy has significant clinical efficacy in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer who cannot undergo surgical resection. Metabolic abnormality testing has important value in monitoring treatment efficacy and patient metabolic status, and can provide reference for optimising clinical treatment plans. Future research should further explore the application value of metabolic abnormality testing in the treatment of lung cancer, and combine it with other detection methods to provide more comprehensive and reliable treatment basis for clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "This Key Paper Evaluation examines a recent modeling study of return-to-work (RTW) interventions comparing inpatient multimodal occupational rehabilitation (I-MORE) with outpatient Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The authors link a randomized trial to seven years of registry follow-up and project costs and effects over a 25-year horizon from healthcare and societal perspectives. We commend the clear intervention definitions, transparent multistate-to-Markov approach, and probabilistic analyses. However, the study's headline finding - lifetime dominance of I-MORE when productivity is counted - hinges on structural assumptions: transition intensities are frozen beyond four years, and within-state absence-day differences are held constant thereafter, generating persistent productivity gains even after state prevalences converge. Health-related quality of life is observed only to 14 months and then modeled as state-specific constants, compressing incremental quality-adjusted life years and leaving the healthcare-only incremental cost-effectiveness ratio unfavorable. We argue that lifetime savings should be treated as upper-bound estimates and that decision relevance would be strengthened by waning-effect scenarios, mid-term horizons, and tests of the absorbing disability state. We also highlight the need for diagnosis-by-treatment analyses and stepped-care sequences given the heterogeneous population and fixed-dose ACT comparator. Overall, the paper advances RTW modeling while underscoring how perspective and structure shape long-run conclusions.",

Feasibility was assessed via intervention and study protocol completion rates. We used linear mixed effects models and effect size metrics to analyse pre - to post-NET changes and strength in effects in primary (PTSD, PCL-5) and secondary outcomes variables (depressive symptoms, PHQ-9; anxiety, GAD-7; somatisation, SSS-8) in all participants who completed NET.<b>Results:</b> Fifty-three women began the NET protocol; 43 completed at least one outcome measurement, and 36 of these women completed the full protocol (81% treatment completion rate, 68% study protocol completion rate).

Participants showed large changes in PTSD symptoms (PCL-5 change: 20.8 points, <i>p</i> <i><</i> .001, <i>d</i> = 0.9) and medium changes in depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 change: 3.1 points, <i>d</i> = 0.57), anxiety (GAD-7 change: 3.8 points, <i>d</i> = 0.7), and somatisation (SSS-8 change: 3.7 points, <i>d</i> = 0.49).<b>Conclusions:</b> NET may be a feasible and clinically pragmatic intervention for reducing PTSD and co-occurring mental health symptoms in HEW. A fully powered, randomised trial to evaluate NET in this population is necessary to definitively determine intervention effects.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In the mutualism between leguminous plants and rhizobia bacteria, rhizobia live inside root nodules, creating potential for host genes to shape the rhizobial selective environment. Many host genes that affect symbiosis have been identified; however, the extent to which these genes affect selection acting on rhizobia is unknown. In this study, we inoculated 18 Medicago truncatula symbiotic mutants (including mutants that alter Nodule Cysteine-Rich (NCR) peptide production, plant defence, and nodule number regulation) with a mixture of 86 Sinorhizobium meliloti strains. Most mutations resulted in reduced host benefits, but the effects on rhizobial benefit (i.e., relative strain fitness) varied widely, revealing widespread host-by-strain fitness interactions. Genome-wide association analyses identified variants on rhizobial replicons pSymA and pSymB as important in mediating strain fitness responses to host mutations. Whereas most top variants affected rhizobial fitness with one host mutation (limited effect variants), nine affected fitness across six or more host mutations. These pervasive variants occurred primarily on pSymA, the symbiotic replicon, and include fixL and some metabolic genes. In contrast to the limited effect variants, variants with pervasive positive effects on strain fitness when host genes were mutated tended to adversely affect fitness in wild-type hosts. Competition assays across Medicago genotypes confirmed a pervasive role for one candidate (malonyl-CoA synthase), and AlphaFold multimer modelling suggests that many rhizobial top candidates could interact with host NCR peptides. Our results reveal how host genetic mutations alter strain fitness, setting the stage for improving rhizobial inoculants and breeding legume hosts better adapted to multi-strain environments.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Skin fibrosis, especially hypertrophic scars (HTS), remains understudied with few effective treatments. Studying HTS is challenging due to its natural tendency to improve over time, making it hard to separate intervention effects. This study evaluated fractional ablative laser treatment for symptomatic HTSs, focusing on variability in patient response. It was hypothesized that pain and itch would decrease post-treatment, and that demographic or injury characteristics might predict responders. A retrospective chart review analyzed pre-treatment and six post-laser sessions using the Patient Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) for pain and itch (1 = low, 10 = high). Patients showing a ≥ 3 point improvement were classified as “responders” (n = 48 for pain, n = 62 for itch); those with ≤2 point improvement or worsening were “non-responders” (n = 62 for pain, n = 76 for itch). In total, 110 patients were analyzed for pain and 138 for itch. Most patients were non-responders for both pain (56.4%) and itch (55.1%). Responders experienced significant reductions in pain and itch after the first session, with stable scores thereafter (p&amp;lt;.0001). Non-responders showed no significant improvement in pain and, for itch, even a significant worsening after the first session. No significant differences were found between groups based on sex, skin type, race, scar age, scar size, or patient age. Responders had higher baseline pain and itch scores than non-responders. The greatest symptom relief occurred after the first treatment. Demographic and injury characteristics did not predict treatment response.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a major clinical challenge due to its aggressive nature and poor prognosis in advanced stages. Late detection, often due to delayed diagnosis, limits treatment success. With the aim of improving early diagnosis of HNSCC, we analyzed urine samples from 19 male HNSCC patients and 10 healthy male subjects, identifying 1427 proteins by mass spectrometry-based proteomics. Of these, 351 proteins were consistently detected in all subjects and selected for quantitative comparisons, which highlighted potential prognostic markers such as RNASE1, LRG1 and CD44. Proteogenomic cross-referencing of mass spectrometry–identified peptides with cancer variant databases suggested the presence of HNSCC-associated protein variants (e.g., GAA p.(Trp746Cys), SIAE p.(Pro210Leu)) as potential indicators of advanced disease. Functional analyzes linked the identified proteins to important tumor-related processes, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition and neutrophil degranulation. These results support urine as a valuable body fluid for proteogenomic profiling as it can be collected non-invasively, is available at large volumes, and enables longitudinal monitoring of molecular changes over time, providing a convenient window into systemic and tumor-associated processes. This study provides proof of concept that tumor related protein variants originating from HNSCC can be detected in urine, supporting its potential as a source of biomarkers for early detection. However, given the small, male-only cohort, these findings should be regarded as preliminary and will require validation in larger, sex-balanced cohorts, including patients with benign or inflammatory head and neck conditions, to confirm disease specificity. Altogether, our data underscores the translational promise of urinary proteogenomics in HNSCC management.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The cardiac burden associated with doxorubicin (DOX) significantly limits its application in cancer treatment. Therefore, it is essential to identify effective strategies to protect the heart from cardiotoxic damage caused by chemotherapy. As sex is among the risk factors associated with DOX‐induced cardiotoxicity, whether the cardiac beneficial effects observed from male mice can be applied to female mice remains unknown. We established a two‐week DOX‐induced cardiotoxicity model, in which the cumulative DOX dose administered to mice was comparable to that used in previous research. This model effectively induces cardiotoxicity and fibrosis while allowing for a sufficiently long monitoring period to evaluate the chemotherapeutic effects of DOX on tumors, without imposing an excessive physiological burden on the mice from prolonged tumor growth. Utilizing this tumor‐bearing murine model, we employed TC‐1 cancer cells, which express HPV16‐E6 and HPV16‐E7 proteins, to investigate the cardioprotective effects of circ‐ZNF609 inhibition in DOX‐treated tumor‐bearing female mice. Our findings indicate that cardiac inhibition of circ‐ZNF609 protects against DOX‐induced cardiotoxicity without compromising the anti‐tumor efficacy of DOX in females. These results suggest that targeting circ‐ZNF609 in the heart may represent a promising and viable therapeutic strategy for preventing DOX‐induced cardiotoxicity.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is a pivotal enzyme in glycolytic metabolism and plays a crucial role in the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Despite its importance, specific inhibitors targeting HK2 are still lacking in clinical practice. In this study, we utilized a human protein microarray to identify a significant interaction between limonin (Lim) and HK2. Subsequent analyses confirmed that Lim effectively inhibits HK2 activity and the modification of histone lactylation. Moreover, Lim's systemic effects include the downregulation of gene expression associated with HSC activation, which is closely linked to its modulation of HK2 and histone lactylation. Additionally, Lim exhibits anti‐fibrotic properties, influencing the expression of genes involved in HSC activation and histone lactylation in vivo. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into how Lim derivatives may mitigate hepatic fibrosis through the suppression of HK2 and targeted regulation of histone lactylation in activated HSCs.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective: To describe the questions youth with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) checked on a question prompt list and evaluate the extent to which youth asked these questions during medical visits. Methods: English-speaking adolescents (N = 102) aged 11 to 17 years with ADHD were enrolled from 2 pediatric primary care clinics in North Carolina; this work focuses on the 52 adolescents in the intervention group. Adolescents who received the intervention watched an educational video and completed a prompt list before visits. Medical visits were recorded, transcribed, and coded for questions asked during visits. The questions adolescents checked on the prompt list were compared with the questions they asked during visits. Results: Adolescents checked an average of 5.6 questions on the prompt list. Forty percent of adolescents who checked a question asked at least 1 question they checked during visits. The most common questions adolescents checked and asked about ADHD were, “Should I reduce my screen time to help with ADHD?” (50.0%) and “Will I grow out of ADHD?” (34.4%). The most common questions adolescents checked and asked about ADHD treatment were, “Should I take my ADHD medicine before I play sports?” (33.3%), “Should I take my ADHD medicine while I am at school?” (28.6%), and “Would talking to a counselor help my ADHD?” (28.6%). Conclusion: Adolescents with ADHD have many questions about ADHD; however, about 60% (n = 31) did not ask any of the questions they checked on the prompt list. Future research should examine how to encourage youth who receive a question prompt list intervention to ask questions during visits.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Atherosclerosis is the primary cause of cardiovascular disease. Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is gut microbiota derived metabolite that contributes to atherogenesis. Formononetin is an isoflavonoid compound that exhibits potential anti-atherogenic properties, but there are no reports of its role in mitigating atherosclerosis by modulating gut microbiota to reduce TMAO production. In this study, formononetin demonstrated anti-atherosclerotic effects by modulating the gut microbiota to reduce TMAO production. Methods: Eight-week-old male LDLR -/- mice were fed on a high-fat diet to induce atherosclerosis, Oil Red O staining was used to assess whether formononetin attenuated atherosclerosis. Fecal transplantation was used to determine whether the anti-atherosclerotic effect of formononetin was mediated by modulation of the gut microbiota. Metagenomic sequencing of the mouse gut microbiota and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to evaluate whether formononetin reduced TMAO production by modulating gut microbiota. Results: Formononetin significantly reduced the plaque area in the entire aorta and aortic root and increased plaque stability. Fecal transplantation confirmed that the anti-atherosclerotic effect of formononetin was associated with modulation of the gut microbiota. Metagenomic sequencing of the mouse gut microbiota showed that formononetin reduced the relative abundance of Firmicutes, increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacteria, and reduced serum TMAO levels. Moreover, formononetin reduced the expression of the cutC gene in the mouse gut microbiota. Conclusion: Formononetin reduced TMAO production by modulating the gut microbiota, thus contributing to its anti-atherosclerotic effects. Modulation of the gut microbiota to reduce TMAO production may represent one of the mechanisms by which formononetin mitigates atherosclerosis. Graphical abstract: http://links.lww.com/AHM/A211",

This study evaluated whether pre-lens tear film stability, assessed by fluorescein tear breakup time (TBUT) and noninvasive keratograph breakup time (NIKBUT), predicts subjective comfort. Methods: This single-center prospective study recruited participants aged 20–40 years without ocular diseases. Narafilcon A and verofilcon A contact lenses were used in a crossover design, with participants assigned to wear narafilcon A lenses for one week followed by verofilcon A lenses for another week (Group NV), or the reverse sequence (Group VN). Pre-lens tear film stability was assessed by NIKBUT and fluorescein TBUT on day 1 and day 7. These ocular measurements were correlated with subjective comfort evaluated with Contact Lens Dry Eye Questionnaire-8 (CLDEQ-8) after wearing each lens type. Results: A total of 82 participants (mean age 29.3 ± 3.3 years; 84% female) completed the study. CLDEQ-8 scores were lower with verofilcon A than with narafilcon A (7.09 ± 5.92 vs. 10.21 ± 7.23; p &lt; 0.05). Fluorescein TBUT was consistently longer with verofilcon A than with narafilcon A, both at 15 minutes on day 1 (Group NV: 6.04 vs. 3.80 seconds; Group VN: 7.24 vs. 3.25 seconds) and at 6 hours on day 7 (Group NV: 4.87 vs. 3.03 seconds; Group VN: 5.67 vs. 3.15 seconds). NIKBUT did not differ significantly between the two lenses at either time point. CLDEQ-8 scores negatively correlated with fluorescein TBUT for both lens types (ρ = –0.29 for narafilcon A, p = 0.002; ρ = –0.20 for verofilcon A, p = 0.008). Conclusion: Verofilcon A provided better subjective comfort compared with Narafilcon A. Fluorescein TBUT, but not NIKBUT, may serve as a complementary assessment for pre-lens tear film stability and subjective comfort, suggesting that fluorescein TBUT offers distinct clinical value in contact lens practice.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor (DNET) and low-grade astrocytoma (LGA) could present very similar MRI findings. DNET have good seizure control after surgical removal and low malignant potential, while LGA may recur or progress This study was designed to obtain more accurate pretreatment diagnosis of DNET and LGA based on MRI findings. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled patients with pathologically proven DNET and LGA from 2000–2024. Individual qualitative and quantitative MRI features were evaluated in both tumors, especially T2-weighted signal intensity ratio(T2SR), which compared tumor T2-weighted signal with normal cerebral white matter. The diagnostic performance of conventional qualitative models including meaningful qualitative MRI features and combined quantitative model including T2SR and ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) value was evaluated using area under curve (AUC). Results: In total, 70 patients (30 DNET, 40 LGA) with mean age of 23.2±11.3(15–57) years and 36 men (51.4%),34 women(48.6%). For individual MRI features, DNET had more FLAIR (fluid attenuated inversion recovery) ring sign [16 (53.3%) versus 12 (30.0%), p = 0.049], higher ADC value [2076.2 (53.4) versus 1660.1(71.9), p &lt;0.001], and higher T2SR (3.56±0.12 versus 2.68±0.63, p &lt; 0.001). The AUC of the T2SR and ADC value was 0.886(0.811-0.962) and 0.824(0.724-0.924), respectively. The combined quantitative model had higher discriminative performance than conventional qualitative model (AUC: 0.905 versus 0.727, p = 0.011). Conclusion: Our study suggested that quantitative MRI features including T2SR and ADC values enhanced discrimination of DNET and LGA and could potentially serve as complementary imaging marker for improving preoperative diagnostic accuracy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The erosive effect of chronic otitis media impairs the middle ear’s ossicles. Alloplastic materials or autologous incus can be used for ossicular repair. Perichondrial roll is simple to use and saves considerable operative time and cost, especially in developing countries where ossicular prosthesis and bone substitutes are not affordable for the majority of patients. Objective: To evaluate the use of the perichondrial roll in the reconstruction of the long process of the incus. Subjects and methods: This study involved 62 patients diagnosed with chronic suppurative otitis media characterized by central perforation, presenting with dry and quiescent ears, and exhibiting an eroded long process of the incus, all of whom underwent tympanoplasty using perichondrial roll and bone pate for reconstruction of the long process of the incus. Audiological evaluations were done for all patients, including preoperative and postoperative evaluation of the air-bone gap and the average pure tone threshold. Results: The mean air pure tone threshold was 21.6 dB after surgery and 41.7 dB before. The air pure tone thresholds after surgery improved significantly compared with those before ( P &lt;0.01). Before surgery, the air-bone gap was 29.6 dB at 0.5 kHz, 30.5 dB at 1 kHz, and 23.9 dB at 2 kHz. At the completion of 6 months of follow-up, the air-bone gap was 6.9 dB at 0.5 kHz, 7.1 dB at 1 kHz, and 7.3 dB at 2 kHz. The air-bone gap revealed a significant improvement in hearing ( P &lt;0.001). Conclusion: Perichondrial roll for bridging the gap between the long process of incus and stapes head seems to be a useful and effective method in ossiculoplasty.",

    "Abstract": "Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is the second most common malignancy in thoracic transplant recipients and is associated with poor survival. Accurate risk prediction is essential for prevention and management. Adult (≥18 years) heart, lung, and heart–lung transplant recipients were extracted from the Scientific Registry of Transplant (SRTR) and the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) databases. A total of 160 donor and recipient pretransplant variables, including demographics, laboratory tests, induction therapy, and human leukocyte antigens (HLA), were analyzed. Risk scores were developed using the FasterRisk algorithm and compared with statistical and machine learning models. Among 89,139 thoracic recipients, the model achieved cross-validated areas under the curve of 0.776, 0.711, and 0.689 for 1, 3, and 5 year PTLD risk prediction, respectively. Steroid induction and previous malignancy were associated with an increased PTLD risk. Younger age (18–27 years at 1 year; 18–23 years at 5 years) was also linked to higher risk. In contrast, positive Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) status, heart transplantation (compared with lung or combined heart–lung), African American ethnicity, and basiliximab induction were associated with a lower risk. The proposed risk scores enhance understanding of PTLD risk factors and enable individualized prediction during the first 5 years after thoracic transplantation.",

    "Abstract": "Impella support before continuous-flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation may injure the aortic valve, potentially accelerating aortic regurgitation (AR) progression, resulting in poor outcomes. A single-center retrospective analysis of 384 patients implanted with durable LVADs between 2011 and 2025 was performed. Patients were separated into prior Impella support (group 1, n = 87) and those without (group 2, n = 297). Outcomes included aortic valve intervention at LVAD implantation, AR prevalence at baseline, within 30 days, and 6 months, and mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Aortic valve intervention occurred in 10.3% of group 1 vs . 5.0% of group 2 ( p = 0.071). Group 1 had higher baseline AR (24% vs . 15%, p = 0.041) and more moderate or worse AR at 30 days (3.4% vs. 0.3%, p = 0.041) and 6 months (6.8% vs . 0.6%, p = 0.014). Impella duration did not correlate with aortic valve intervention (median 8 vs . 6 days, p = 0.198). Mortality at 30 days (2% vs . 4%, p = 0.958) and 1 year (7% vs . 13%, p = 0.116) was similar. Impella use before durable LVAD was associated with increased AR progression at 30 days and 6 months. This suggests those with preoperative Impella should have the aortic valve assessed at the time of removal and consider intervention if significant.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction and importance: Pathology of the falciform ligament is rare in adulthood due to the closure of the communication of the umbilicus with the external environment during embryological development. Compared to the pediatric population, where pathologies arise from external communication, falciform ligament abscesses in adults occur as a sequelae of hepatopancreaticobiliary pathology through an unclear mechanism. Falciform ligament abscess in adults is an exceedingly rare complication, with only 19 cases published in English literature. Case presentation: A 77-year-old male presented with right upper quadrant and epigastric pain and fevers in the setting of deranged liver function tests, elevated lipase, and no radiological evidence of cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or liver pathology. Gallbladder perforation, communication, and falciform ligament abscess formation were confirmed on interval computerized tomography during admission. They were initially managed with antibiotics, cholecystectomy, and intraoperative drainage of the abscess. Re-accumulation of the abscess required further antimicrobial therapy and wound drainage. They made a full recovery without complications. Clinical discussion: We present 1 of 2 published cases of gallbladder perforation into the falciform ligament with subsequent abscess formation. Our case demonstrates a pathologic communication between gallbladder and falciform ligament, contrary to the current hypothesis of abscess formation. Moreover, there was absence of a demonstratable cause of portal venous reflux as a mode of bacterial transit. Conclusion: Definitive management of the causative pathology and drainage of a non-loculated abscess is reasonable, and prompt diagnosis and management are required to prevent further complications, such as sepsis or cholecysto-umbilical fistula formation.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is the most common subtype of thyroid cancer, generally associated with a favorable prognosis. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is emerging as a minimally invasive alternative to surgery, particularly for patients unsuitable for active surveillance and surgery. This report presents the first documented case of RFA for PTMC in Indonesia. Case report: A 40-year-old woman presented with a palpable thyroid nodule on the right side of her neck. Thyroid ultrasound and thyroid core needle biopsy confirmed PTMC. The patient underwent RFA using a 5-mm probe tip and 50-Watt power, employing the “moving shot” technique. The procedure was successful, with no reported complications. Follow-up assessments showed a significant reduction in tumor volume of 95.38%, from 0.264 ml to 0.012 ml, with no signs of progression at 12 months. Discussion: RFA provides a minimally invasive alternative to active surveillance with advantages, giving patient definitive treatment. Compare to surgery, this treatment have advantage such as shorter procedure time, lower procedural costs, reduced blood loss, and preservation of thyroid function, leading to faster recovery. However, wider adoption in Indonesia remains limited by the need for trained operators and access to advanced ultrasonography equipment. Strengthening workforce training, improving infrastructure, and generating long-term outcome data are essential for broader implementation. Conclusion: This case highlights RFA as a safe and effective treatment for PTMC, particularly for patients who do not wish to undergo active surveillance management for low risk thyroid cancer. Further studies are necessary to assess its long-term efficacy and feasibility.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction and importance: Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) has significantly advanced the treatment of a wide range of shoulder disorders, expanding its indications from rotator cuff arthropathy to include irreparable rotator cuff tears, complex fractures, and inflammatory arthritis. However, the rapid increase in RTSA procedures has been accompanied by a corresponding rise in complications, with dislocation being one of the most prevalent early postoperative complications. Case presentation: This case report presents a 74-year-old, right-hand dominant female patient with a periprosthetic fracture of the right shoulder. She underwent revision surgery involving glenoid lateralization and the use of a thicker, restrictive polyethylene insert. Postoperatively, the patient experienced pain and instability, eventually leading to an atraumatic anterior dislocation. A re-revision surgery was performed, incorporating an anterior sling using a hamstring autograft to address subscapularis deficiency caused by recurrent dislocations, and an increased humeral tray size for improved containment. Approximately 2 years after the re-revision surgery, the patient demonstrated restored stability, improved range of motion, and reported satisfaction with the outcome. Clinical discussion: Numerous recommendations for addressing instability or dislocation following RTSA have been discussed in the literature. Dislocation may be influenced by several biomechanical factors, including humeral shortening, excessive medialization, implant version, socket constraint, soft-tissue tensioning, and nerve dysfunction. Subscapularis deficiency is a potential contributor to recurrent dislocations. Few techniques have been described to manage and enhance soft tissue tension in cases of subscapularis insufficiency. Conclusion: This case report highlights the challenges of managing recurrent anterior dislocation following RTSA. It demonstrates the successful use of an anterior hamstring autograft sling as a salvage procedure to restore stability in cases of persistent anterior dislocation after RTSA. However, further clinical studies are needed to better define the role of such interventions in addressing complications associated with RTSA.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Allergic reactions against the hemostatic agent Floseal during or after spine surgery are very rare, with six cases reported in the literature so far. We present a case of type IV hypersensitivity reaction against Floseal after an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery. We also review the literature of reactions against Floseal for patients who have undergone spinal surgeries. Presentation of case: A 25-year-old male patient was admitted to our center with images revealing a C5 teardrop fracture and rupture of the upper and lower discs. C5 corpectomy was performed successfully without any intraoperative adverse events. On the morning of the third day post-op, the patient developed respiratory distress accompanied by swelling beneath the surgical wound. We performed an urgent exploration of the wound and evacuation of the collection. The collection was watery and clear with Floseal remnants visible. Histopathological analysis of the fluid revealed no evidence of infection but showed inflammatory changes with leukocytosis. Symptoms resolved after the second surgery and the patient recovered with no further complications. Discussion: The delayed onset of localized swelling following surgery and rapid resolution after irrigation and removal of Floseal remnant particles is highly suggestive of a delayed-hypersensitivity reaction to Floseal. Delayed-hypersensitivity reaction should be considered in the differential diagnosis of delayed post-op swelling where Floseal was used. Conclusion: We believe this is the first reported case of delayed-hypersensitivity reaction to Floseal, which occurred after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Bilateral sacroiliac joint (SIJ) disruption is an uncommon, unstable pelvic injury with high morbidity. Percutaneous SI screw fixation is a well-established treatment but typically requires separate guidewire passes, increasing operative time and radiation exposure. Case and Technique: We report a 22-year-old male with bilateral pubic rami fractures and bilateral SIJ disruptions. After reduction and fixation of anterior ring, a single guidewire was passed from the left to the right SIJ, and bilateral screws were inserted over it under fluoroscopic guidance. Results: Bilateral fixation was successfully achieved with correct screw placement, effective compression, and intact L5 nerve function. This approach reduced operative time and fluoroscopic exposure. Conclusion: Single-guidewire bilateral SIJ fixation is a simple, effective technique that decreases operative time and radiation exposure while ensuring safe, stable fixation. Careful fluoroscopic monitoring is essential, and the method is feasible in both obese and nonobese patients.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction and importance: Giant ovarian cysts are rare in contemporary practice due to early radiological detection. Cardiac compromise resulting from mechanical compression by such masses is exceptionally uncommon and poses significant diagnostic and perioperative challenges, particularly in resource-limited settings. Case presentation: A 39-year-old woman presented with a 4-month history of progressive abdominal distension, fatigue, and dyspnea. Imaging revealed a massive multiloculated cystic ovarian mass measuring 38 × 31 × 24 cm, compressing surrounding viscera. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated global left ventricular hypokinesia with a reduced ejection fraction of 30–35%, consistent with cardiac dysfunction secondary to mass effect. The patient underwent fertility-preserving staging laparotomy, including right salphingo-oophorectomy. The excised mass measured 40 × 40 cm and weighed 18.6 kg. Histopathology confirmed a borderline mucinous cystadenoma confined to the right ovary (FIGO stage IA). Clinical discussion: Giant ovarian cysts can rarely induce reversible cardiac dysfunction through elevated intra-abdominal pressure and impaired venous return. Early echocardiographic assessment and multidisciplinary coordination are essential for risk stratification and perioperative planning. In this case, cardiac function improved following tumor removal, supporting a compression-related mechanism rather than intrinsic cardiomyopathy. Conclusion: This case highlights a rare but life-threatening presentation of reversible cardiac compromise caused by a giant ovarian cyst. Timely diagnosis, echocardiographic evaluation, and coordinated surgical management enabled a favorable outcome despite limited resources, emphasizing the importance of early intervention in similar high-risk presentations.",

    "Abstract": "Unicoronal synostosis (UCS) causes asymmetric forehead morphology and is commonly managed with fronto-orbital advancement (FOA). However, optimal reconstruction remains challenging as the location of the forehead’s pivot line, the hinge axis for advancement, often remains uncertain. We conducted a geometric morphometric analysis using 235 cranial landmarks in 16 patients with UCS (aged &lt;2 y) and 11 age-matched controls. CT-derived cranial models were assessed with generalized Procrustes analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) to evaluate morphologic asymmetry and identify potential pivot lines. PC1 (35.7%) captured asymmetric differences, whereas PC2 (22.8%) represented symmetric variation. Compared with controls, patients with UCS exhibited frontal retrusion and temporal bossing on the affected side, along with frontal bossing on the contralateral side. Wireframe deformation revealed morphologic deviation concentrated near the orbit but not along the cranial midline. Importantly, pivot lines differed between the frontal bone and the supraorbital bandeau, suggesting independent hinge axes. In UCS, the pivot line is not at the midline but lateralized near the orbit. Consequently, the frontal bone and supraorbital bandeau should be repositioned around a separate hinge axis during FOA. These findings support more symmetric and individualized cranial reconstruction.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Brands increasingly rely on both celebrities and social media influencers to build brand equity in digitally mediated environments. Despite their widespread managerial use, it remains unclear why these two types of opinion leaders shape consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) through different psychological mechanisms. This study addresses this issue by examining whether credibility and parasocial relationships (PSRs) operate as distinct pathways through which celebrities and influencers contribute to brand equity on social media. Clarifying these mechanisms is essential for advancing endorsement theory and for guiding more effective endorsement strategy decisions. Design/methodology/approach The study employs a quantitative, cross-sectional design based on survey data from 310 active social media users in Lithuania. To capture both contributory and indispensable mechanisms, the analysis integrates partial least squares-structural equation modeling with Necessary Condition Analysis (NCA), allowing for a comparison of sufficiency-based effects and non-compensatory conditions across celebrity and influencer endorsement contexts. Findings The results reveal structurally different endorsement mechanisms. For influencers, credibility strengthens PSRs, which in turn positively drive CBBE. In contrast, for celebrities, PSRs do not significantly translate into brand equity. Instead, credibility emerges as a critical prerequisite for celebrities to generate brand equity, even though it does not exert a direct net effect. NCA further shows that PSRs are required, albeit weakly, for influencer-driven brand equity, whereas credibility constitutes a necessary condition in celebrity endorsements. Practical implications The findings demonstrate that celebrities and influencers should not be treated as interchangeable endorsement sources. Influencer strategies should prioritize long-term collaborations that foster relational closeness and emotional attachment, whereas celebrity endorsements require careful credibility screening and strategic fit with brand values. These insights enable managers to align endorsement choices with specific brand equity objectives and to evaluate endorsement effectiveness using mechanism-consistent performance metrics. Originality/value This study advances endorsement research by incrementally extending and refining existing theory to explain why celebrities and influencers influence brand equity through fundamentally different causal pathways. By combining structural equation modeling with NCA, it introduces an asymmetric perspective that moves beyond traditional net-effect explanations and clarifies theoretical boundary conditions in social media endorsement research.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore how artificial intelligence (AI), integrated with business process management (BPM), knowledge management (KM) and business intelligence (BI), can optimize decision-making in geo-economic contexts, utilizing the resource-based view (RBV) theory. Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered from over 280 professionals representing listed information technology companies in northern India using a structured questionnaire. Convenience sampling was employed for data collection. The measurement and structural models were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings AI adoption significantly improves BI, BPM and KM practices though it has no direct effect on geo-economic decision-making (GEDM). BPM, however, strongly drives both GEDM and KM, positioning it as a key strategic enabler. Mediation analysis shows that BI and BPM partially transmit AI's influence on organizational decision-making.

We assessed the mediating relationship between STARA awareness, job insecurity and turnover intention and the moderating effects of mindfulness and self-efficacy. Design/methodology/approach To reduce common method variance and make stronger causal inferences, we administered surveys to 318 South Korean service employees in three waves, each spaced three months apart. We tested our hypotheses using Mplus macro and bootstrapping (N = 5,000). Findings As predicted, we found a mediating relationship between STARA awareness, job insecurity and turnover intention. We observed a three-way interaction effect of STARA awareness, mindfulness and self-efficacy on job insecurity. When mindfulness and self-efficacy were high, the positive association between STARA awareness and job insecurity and the positive effect of STARA awareness on turnover intention through job insecurity were the least pronounced.

    "Abstract": "Purpose Climate-driven agricultural risks in Zimbabwe, particularly droughts, high dependence on rainfed production and low adaptive capacity, limit the agriculture sector from fully contributing to socio-economic development. The objective of the study was to assess the status of funding for climate change adaptation across all farming sectors. Design/methodology/approach The 2022 national budget was analyzed in terms of allocation for agricultural and climate change adaptation interventions. At the farm level, availability of funding was assessed for fully commercial (A2, large-scale and estates), semi-commercial (A1) and subsistence (communal and old resettlement) farmers in Mutasa District in eastern Zimbabwe using a mix of key informant interviews, focus group discussions and a household questionnaire. Findings According to the 2022 budget, the government contributed 92% of total agricultural funding and 72% of climate change adaptation financing. Bilateral and multilateral climate finance accounted for only 3% of total agricultural funding, underscoring the country's ranking of 156 out of 160 on the Global Climate Finance Vulnerability Index. Semi-commercial and subsistence-oriented farmers depended mainly on the government and donors for funding in the form of crop inputs. The commercial sector depended on state-owned and private banks. Over 80% of farmers viewed agricultural and climate funding, availed mostly as working capital and not capital expenditure, to be inadequate. Originality/value There is a need to develop a comprehensive investment framework that guides the design of sustainable financing mechanisms for effective adaptation.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study is aimed at investigating the implementation of circular economy (CE) strategies in a developing economy context with the view of understanding the construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste management dynamics. Design/methodology/approach Sequel to a systematic review of literature, data were collected via Delphi survey from 22 and 17 Nigerian construction experts in the first and second rounds, respectively. Consensus was established after the stability of responses in the second round. Data were analysed using mean score ranking, rank agreement factor and inter-rater analysis. Findings Nineteen distinct CE strategies for managing C&amp;D were identified. Subsequent assessment revealed mild implementation of these strategies across different construction stages, with the least implementation at the end-of-life phase, despite producing the most waste. Practical implications The study revealed very mild implementation of CE strategies within the Nigerian Construction Industry (NCI) and highlighted the diverse views among the experts regarding the effectiveness of the strategies for managing C&amp;D waste. Results from the study will offer an insightful guide for stakeholders and policymakers to understand the suitability of CE strategies at different stages of C&amp;D waste for efficient policy development and decision-making. Originality/value This research contributes to the CE literature by synthesising the existing body of knowledge on CE strategies to manage C&amp;D waste sustainably across the construction value chain of developing economies. It also establishes a foundation for prioritising effective CE strategies in the NCI and disseminating knowledge about ineffective related to waste management.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose While the control of virtual influencers’ appearance, behaviour and beliefs is appealing to brands, it remains unclear whether consumers, particularly adolescents, can fully grasp and cope with this new form of persuasive communication. Hence, the purpose of this study is to investigate how adolescents perceive exposure to virtual influencer marketing and the role parents play in adolescents’ coping with persuasive mediums on social media. Design/methodology/approach Focus groups were conducted: four with adolescents (age 12–18, n = 17) and four with parents (n = 16). The focus group data were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings Findings reveal that adolescents experienced emotional discomfort and a sense of betrayal when exposed to virtual influencers without clear disclosure of their artificial nature, indicating that disclosure serves not only a cognitive but also a protective, emotional function. At the same time, parents expressed uncertainty and felt digitally unprepared to guide their children. Research limitations/implications While this study explores adolescents’ first exposure to virtual influencer marketing, future research should explore the perceptions of adolescents who follow or engage with virtual influencers regularly. Furthermore, future research should have a holistic perspective of parents, including parenting style as well as parental involvement. Practical implications The findings highlight the importance of clear disclosure of virtual influencers’ artificial nature to prevent emotional discomfort among adolescents and underscore the need for greater support for parents through education, platform responsibility and regulatory guidance. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study offers new insights into how adolescents and parents perceive virtual influencer marketing, highlighting perceived emotional risks, the role of disclosure and the need for shared responsibility in supporting adolescents’ media literacy.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to synthesize meta-analytic research in the banking sector by mapping thematic clusters and identifying theoretical and methodological patterns. It highlights how meta-analyses contribute to understanding heterogeneity across banking contexts. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review was conducted across seven academic databases using targeted search terms. Four thematic clusters were identified: technology adoption, consumer trust and satisfaction, behavioral aspects and digital financial innovation. Findings The analysis revealed theoretical convergence in some domains (e.g., technology acceptance model in technology adoption) and fragmentation in others (e.g., behavioral aspects). Some clusters (e.g., technology adoption) show more methodological maturity, while others (e.g., behavioral) require further development. Moderator analysis and sample size variation indicate the need for more balanced and standardized designs. Contextual moderators such as culture, regulation and infrastructure significantly impact effect sizes. Research limitations/implications There may be publication bias due to the exclusion of gray literature and non-significant results. Clustering may oversimplify overlapping constructs between domains. Future research should integrate longitudinal, qualitative and interdisciplinary designs. Practical implications Banks should prioritize trust, transparency and user-centric innovation to enhance consumer engagement. Policymakers must design context-sensitive regulation to support both inclusion and innovation. Financial education and CSR strategies are crucial for strengthening long-term brand trust. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first structured meta-review focused on banking marketing meta-analyses. It offers a comparative evaluation of theoretical frameworks, methodologies and moderator applications. The study contributes a novel cluster-based framework to map research maturity and heterogeneity.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly considered a transformative force within the logistics industry, improving efficiency and enhancing effectiveness for many organisations, including third-party logistics service providers (3PLs). However, the academic literature reveals a limited understanding of how 3PLs can approach the opportunities offered by AI. To fill this gap, we leverage the dynamic capabilities theory to explore AI adoption within the 3PL industry. Design/methodology/approach We developed a single case study focusing on a leading British 3PL that introduced AI to improve warehousing operations and planning activities. We collected data through two rounds of qualitative interviews with managerial-level stakeholders from different departments and two on-site visits. Through abductive reasoning, we iteratively compared empirics with the available theoretical knowledge to illuminate how 3PLs can approach AI opportunities through their sensing, seizing and reconfiguring dynamic capabilities. Findings Findings illustrate several micro-foundations underpinning higher-order dynamic capabilities. Sensing AI opportunities critically depends on building internal AI awareness as well as involving customers to embed their perspectives, leading to prioritising AI use cases. Seizing starts with aligning use cases with the business strategy, then procuring AI solutions and assessing their security and ethical implications before embedding different AI tools. These initiatives foster resource reconfiguration by embracing a cultural shift involving 3PLs and their customers and developing a robust data infrastructure to support AI efforts. Building on these findings, we suggest evolutionary patterns for dynamic capabilities through AI adoption. Originality/value Existing research has yet to fully explore how 3PLs can approach AI adoption. The study contextualises the dynamic capabilities theory for AI-driven opportunities, elaborating on earlier studies to identify micro-foundations for 3PLs' higher-order dynamic capabilities. It proposes a set of research propositions and offers a research agenda to foster future exploration about embedding AI into logistics operations. By focusing on 3PLs in the context of rising digitalisation, the study highlights how firms can navigate the complexities of AI adoption, offering original insights to leverage the synergies among human workforce, technological tools and physical assets.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study examines citizens' engagement with information during the COVID-19 crisis. While the desire for information intensifies during health crises, such circumstances pose challenges to citizens' ability of to adapt to new situations. Familiar information behaviour, such as seeking and scanning intertwine with collective sensemaking to navigate the situation successfully. While citizen-led adaptation is crucial in public crisis management, limited academic attention has focused on understanding the process of information engagement. The purpose of the study is to investigate how information behaviour and collective sensemaking jointly support adaptation from public management viewpoint. Design/methodology/approach The data for this study were provided by 30 semi-structured interviews with members of COVID-19-related Facebook groups. All participants were from Finland, which provided the context for the study. Abductive thematic analysis and narrative practices were applied to analyse the interviews. Findings The findings revealed that while citizens' information engagement shared patterns, it manifested in distinctive ways in terms of information behaviours and epistemic ideals. We assign four profiles to encapsulate the narratives elicited: Attendants, Mainstreamers, Outriders and Tribesmen. Originality/value This article contributes to the discourse on citizens' information behaviour and sensemaking in informal environments. By focusing on citizens' viewpoints concerning adaptation in times of crisis, the findings contribute to the literature on public crisis management in societal emergencies.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Whilst the use of artificial intelligence (AI) partners in the workplace has become more pervasive in recent years, the effects of teamwork partner type (human vs AI) on collaboration proficiency, especially for temporary tasks, remain unclear. Based on the computers are social actors (CASA) paradigm, we identify the mechanism to explain how partner type and partners' emotion influence collaboration proficiency when dealing with temporary tasks. Design/methodology/approach Through an online experiment, hypotheses were examined using data collected from 861 employees working in the online retail industry. Findings The results indicate that the type of teamwork partner does not significantly influence collaboration proficiency. However, emotion plays a significant moderating role in the relationship between partner type and collaboration proficiency. Additionally, several mediation effects are identified. Specifically, teamwork partner type moderates the effect of service empathy on collaboration proficiency whilst service empathy mediates the association between emotion and collaboration proficiency. Originality/value This study is the first to reveal, from the employee's perspective, the outcomes of human–human and human–AI collaborations when dealing with temporary tasks in a virtual context. These findings can empower managers to more effectively select and pair teamwork partners, while also creating work environments that are more attuned to and supportive of emotional dynamics.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose As an efficient path planning algorithm, MPPI has received significant attention in the field of path tracking and planning for mobile robots. However, traditional MPPI tends to fall into local minima under extremely clutter environments and thus generates infeasible control sequences. To address this problem, an MPPI control algorithm based on encoder-decoder LSTM is proposed to handle the optimal motion planning problem in clutter environments. Design/methodology/approach First, the encoder-decoder LSTM network is designed to give MPPI a reference point at each time step. Then, according to the current position and the reference point, the PD controller is used to get the control input at that moment based on the traditional LSTM network framework, which is taken as the sample mean. To improve the real-time performance and computational efficiency of the algorithm, the MPPI sampling part is executed in parallel on the GPU platform, while other control and processing parts are calculated on the CPU. Findings This paper presents three sets of comparative experiments, including both simulations and physical tests, to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In challenging environments, the algorithm achieved a hundred percent success rate, successfully guiding the transport robot to move items from the starting point to the target destination while avoiding obstacles along the way. Originality/value The algorithm proposed in this paper offers a reference method for robot navigation in complex environments. It addresses the issue of traditional MPPI algorithms being prone to local minima, thereby generating more efficient control sequences.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Despite significant progress in global literacy campaigns, millions of adults remain illiterate, particularly in rural areas. With the ubiquity of smartphones, illiterate and semi-literate populations are increasingly engaging with digital technologies. This study examines the vernacular affordances these users generate in everyday smartphone use and investigates how such affordances shape their cognitive, emotional, and social experiences. Design/methodology/approach The study draws on participatory observation and semi-structured interviews with 17 illiterate and semi-literate individuals in a rural village in Shanxi Province, China. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis guided by the framework of vernacular affordances. Findings The analysis identifies three vernacular affordance characteristics—from hidden to perceptible, accidental, and incomplete—and explains how they are realized through three pathways: intergenerational digital support (“digital back-feeding”), symbol–meaning matching, and practice through repetition. These pathways help transform initially opaque smartphone functions into perceptible ones, while also producing affordances that remain unstable or only partially realized. Despite these limitations, smartphone use enhanced informal learning, micro-literacy development, emotional intimacy, and social participation. Originality/value The study advances affordance theory by contextualizing vernacular affordances in a rural, low-literacy environment and by demonstrating their unstable, fragmented, and culturally embedded nature. It also shows that the classification of affordances integrates both theoretical insights and empirically derived characteristics. In practice, the findings highlight the importance of intergenerational digital mentorship, culturally sensitive interface design, and policies that promote not only access but also meaningful digital inclusion.",

We estimate a set of linear models relating the borrower's ESG ratings to the bank's ESG ratings and to the loan conditions. Findings We find that firms with higher ESG scores are more likely to secure loans from banks that also have strong ESG ratings, especially in politically liberal states. Such firms also benefit from more favorable loan terms, including lower interest rates and a reduced number covenants. Originality/value This study highlights the dual role of ESG in influencing both borrower–lender matching and loan contracting outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study investigates how national culture influences non-financial reporting (NFR) by reviewing existing studies on the topic and proposing a research agenda. The review addresses two research questions: (1) What are the main characteristics of studies examining the influence of national culture on NFR? (2) Which themes and cultural factors have received attention and can be systematised to guide future research and address regulatory and implementation challenges? Design/methodology/approach We conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of 60 academic articles indexed in Scopus from 1999 to 2024 to identify conceptually relevant themes, from which we derive a conceptual framework and avenues for future research. Findings The review reveals a fragmented yet growing body of literature and organises its insights into a conceptual framework based on three key stages of NFR: adoption, content and assurance. Five themes and six subthemes emerge, highlighting the recurring influence of some cultural dimensions. The review also reveals notable research gaps, including an overreliance on Hofstede's cultural framework, a lack of methodological diversity, a limited focus on strategic and governance-related disclosures and language use, and the underexplored interplay between NFR, national culture and regulatory contexts. Future research is encouraged to examine how cultural traits interact with regulation in the adoption of NFR, influence reporting quality and narratives, and affect the credibility and effectiveness of assurance practices. Originality/value To the best of our knowledge, this is the first SLR to focus specifically on the role of national culture in NFR. The study advances prior work on cultural influences in accounting by narrowing the focus to the NFR domain. In addition, it enriches the literature on NFR determinants by isolating national culture as a key factor. In doing so, the study lays the groundwork for future research on how cultural traits may support or challenge the effectiveness of mandatory NFR frameworks across countries.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study sought to interrogate the role of university partnerships and campus diversity in enhancing the relevance and competitiveness of Kenya’s higher education. Design/Methodology/Approach The study adopts a systematic review guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Framework, examining published research from 2000 to 2025. A total of 43 peer-reviewed manuscripts met the inclusion criteria. The analysis focused on staff and student diversity, the push-and-pull factors influencing staff and student mobility, the underlying rationales for campus diversity and the role of university diversity in fostering multicultural global competencies. Findings The systematic review found that university diversity served as a hallmark of pluralism and a symbol of prestige within Kenyan higher education institutions. The systematic review also highlighted that partnerships are central to internationalization, often serving as channels for accessing limited local funding, strengthening faculty capacity and enhancing institutional competitiveness. Despite these benefits, most partnerships remain dominated by the Global North in terms of agenda setting, decision-making and funding which limits their impact. This underscores the need for more inclusive, context-sensitive collaborations that address local priorities. Additionally, the study found that both partnerships and diverse campus communities play a significant role in fostering multicultural global competencies. Originality/Value This study provides a critical examination of university partnerships and campus diversity in advancing multicultural awareness as a pathway to global competencies. While diversity within the university community is essential for cultivating globally competent leaders, effective partnerships require careful evaluation of the resources involved and the extent to which such collaborations align with institutional priorities and needs.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to revisit the expropriation and bonding effects of specific asset investment (SAI) in B2B marketing channels by considering the dual pathways of channel role behaviors (suppliers’ in-role contract enforcement and distributors’ extra-role altruistic behavior) between SAI and cooperative performance and examines how suppliers’ fairness perceptions (distributive and procedural fairness) moderate these relationships. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on agency theory and equity theory, this study develops a comprehensive model connecting SAI, channel role behaviors and fairness perceptions. The hypotheses were tested using survey data collected from 580 home appliance distributors in mainland China. Findings The results reveal that SAI positively influences both suppliers’ in-role contract enforcement and distributors’ extra-role altruistic behavior, with both channel role behaviors positively contributing to cooperative performance in B2B relationships. Fairness perceptions moderate these relationships differently: distributive fairness enhances the relationship between SAI and distributors’ extra-role altruistic behavior, while procedural fairness strengthens the relationship between SAI and suppliers’ in-role contract enforcement. Channel role behaviors partially mediate the relationship between SAI and cooperative performance. Originality/value This study contributes to B2B marketing channel literature by revisiting SAI from the perspective of channel role behaviors, providing a novel lens to understand the expropriation and bonding effects in industrial exchange relationships. By identifying how suppliers’ SAI simultaneously influence different types of channel role behaviors, this study reveals important mechanisms through which these investments transmit to cooperative performance. This study also demonstrates how different dimensions of fairness shape these behavioral pathways in B2B contexts, offering new insights for channel relationship management beyond traditional perspectives.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to examine the relationship between environmental, social, and governance (ESG) commitment and technological innovation capabilities (TIC), with a focus on the moderating effect of gender diversity on corporate boards. It seeks to uncover whether ESG practices serve as strategic resources for innovation and how board diversity influences this dynamic. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative approach is employed using panel data from 3,048 listed firms across Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and Finland over the period 2019–2023. The study uses regression analysis to evaluate the relationship between ESG performance and TIC, incorporating gender diversity on boards as a moderating variable. The resource-based view (RBV) provides the theoretical lens for understanding ESG as a source of innovation-enhancing resources. Findings Results show a positive relationship between ESG commitment and TIC, affirming the strategic role of ESG practices in driving innovation. However, gender diversity on boards negatively moderates this relationship. This suggests that while ESG fosters innovation, board gender diversity may not always enhance this process, possibly due to integration challenges or tokenism. The findings call for a more nuanced approach to managing board diversity to realize innovation benefits fully. Practical implications The study highlights the complex interplay between board diversity, ESG efforts, and innovation outcomes. It emphasizes the need for inclusive corporate cultures that go beyond symbolic diversity. By recognizing gender diversity as more than a numerical representation, firms can better harness diverse viewpoints for innovation. The research also stresses the importance of ESG responsiveness to meet stakeholder expectations and contribute to sustainable development goals. Originality/value This research contributes to the limited empirical literature linking ESG commitment to technological innovation and introduces board gender diversity as a critical but complex moderator. It challenges assumptions about the universal benefits of diversity, providing new insights for both scholars and practitioners. The findings advance the RBV by framing ESG as a strategic asset and offer practical recommendations for firms aiming to align governance, innovation, and sustainability.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The aim of this research is to examine the influence of economic growth and currency crisis on research productivity. Design/methodology/approach The research analyzes the data of 548 Turkish academics in faculties of economic and administrative sciences in Turkish universities by using polled OLS, binary logistic regression, two-stage least squares (2SLS) and the difference-in-differences regression models. Findings The findings indicate that researchers in universities located in regions with higher economic growth and lower risk of poverty have higher research productivity. In addition, the results show that currency crisis has no significant influence on research performance. Practical implications The results of this study provide signals for policymakers about the importance of policies that support research activities and mitigate the pressures on research funding during financial crises. The significance of these policies also increases in regions with lower economic development and growth. Originality/value To author's knowledge, this research is the first to investigate the influence of currency crisis on research productivity.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of knowledge stock in the national-level emergence of tech scaleups from a configurational perspective. While prior research has recognized the importance of knowledge stock in the emergence of high-growth firms and examined elements of entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs), its predominant reliance on econometric models has yielded a fragmented understanding, leaving unclear how knowledge stock combines with EE resource endowments to support such emergence. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship and ecosystem thinking, this study integrates aggregate data from the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor and Startup Genome. The authors construct a cross-national data set covering 31 countries and apply fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. Findings The results of this study reveal that knowledge stock plays a systemically important and consistently prominent role across high-emergence pathways; its influence is contingent upon the broader resource endowments of EE; and compared with resource endowments of EE, knowledge stock exhibits lower causal asymmetry, suggesting a relatively more stable role. Originality/value This study advances the literature on the geography of high-growth entrepreneurship by moving beyond single-factor econometric approaches to examine how knowledge stock interacts with other EE resources in national contexts. Using fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis, the authors identify multiple resource configurations that enable tech scaleup emergence, reveal the context-dependent nature of knowledge stock’s impact and demonstrate its lower causal asymmetry relative to other resources. These insights refine theoretical understanding of how different resource combinations jointly foster high-growth entrepreneurship.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose With security breaches in modern organizations increasingly linked to human factors, strengthening the “human firewall” has become essential. This study investigates how organizations can promote extra-role security behaviors – voluntary actions beyond formal responsibilities. Drawing on social information processing theory, we argue that employees interpret organizational and relational cues to shape their security behaviors. Within this framework, we incorporate leader–member exchange (LMX) theory to propose that information security (IS) climate elements (practice, importance and laxness) and LMX quality play critical roles in fostering employees' voluntary security actions. Design/methodology/approach This study used a 2-step testing process for the survey and adopted a partial least squares-structural equation modeling to test the proposed model with a sample of 564 validated responses. Findings The findings indicate that IS climate elements increase IS awareness and beliefs, leading to enhanced extra-role security behaviors. Furthermore, LMX has direct and moderating effects on extra-role security behaviors, significantly contributing to the field of behavioral IS. Originality/value This study offers a novel perspective by highlighting the roles of IS climate and LMX in shaping extra-role security behaviors. By focusing on voluntary security actions rather than compliance-driven behaviors, it diverges from prior research and provides a distinct theoretical contribution to the behavioral IS literature.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to investigate how entrepreneurial firms transform turbulence within their ecosystems, originating from clients, competitors and suppliers, into innovation success. Drawing on contingency theory, the study emphasizes analytical capacity as a key mediating mechanism. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 140 entrepreneurial manufacturing firms in Québec, drawn from the Centre de Recherche Industrielle du Québec database. Using the key informant approach, data were collected from chief executive officers, directors and senior managers. The research model was tested with partial least squares structural equation modeling and evaluated for predictive relevance and effect size to ensure the robustness of results. Findings The results reveal that entrepreneurial ecosystem turbulence (EET) positively influences innovation performance but only indirectly through analytical capacity. Entrepreneurial firms with stronger analytical capacity are more effective in capturing signals from clients, competitors and suppliers, which enables them to adapt their strategies and turn environmental disruptions into opportunities. The findings confirm that analytical capacity fully mediates the relationship between ecosystem turbulence and innovation outcomes, highlighting its central role as a dynamic capability in turbulent environments. Originality/value The study introduces EET as a second-order construct comprising client, competitor and supplier turbulence and demonstrates that analytical capacity functions as a contingent resource that aligns internal capabilities with external conditions. By adopting an informational perspective, the research advances entrepreneurship studies and shows how data analytics can transform turbulence into sustained innovation success.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose As value co-creation has become central to marketing practices, social media strategies have been extensively studied as a key approach to fostering co-creation. However, existing research has treated this strategy at a broad conceptual level, offering a limited understanding of the involved inherent “benefit-risk” dilemma. Building on service-dominant logic, this study aims to focus on social monitoring strategy – a more nuanced form of social media strategies. The study conceptualizes it as a distinct value proposition that promotes value co-creation, thereby mitigating the “benefit-risk” dilemma. Specifically, the study examines the direct effects of social monitoring strategies on value co-creation, mediating roles of absorptive and joint learning capacities, and moderating effects of urban digital infrastructure on these mediating mechanisms. Design/methodology/approach This study is based on 340 firm-level survey data obtained from a questionnaire survey and public data from statistical yearbooks. Empirical testing was conducted using the AMOS and SPSS research methods. Findings A social monitoring strategy is a value proposition that promotes value co-creation. This process is mediated by absorptive and joint learning capacities, with the mediating effects moderated by urban digital infrastructure. Originality/value This study advances a novel perspective by conceptualizing social monitoring strategy as a distinct value proposition and investigating how it drives value co-creation. More importantly, it addresses the “benefit-risk” paradox highlighted in existing research. By introducing a moderated mediation model, it opens the “black box” between social monitoring strategy and value co-creation, underscoring the critical role of urban digital infrastructure in strengthening this process.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper examines the effects of workplace romance on employee envy and resultant work-related outcomes, including thriving at work, intrinsic motivation, and turnover intention. This paper also analyzes how work autonomy can enhance the negative impact of workplace romance on employee envy. This paper employed social comparison theory (SCT) and self-determination theory (SDT) to explain underlying psychological processes. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected via an online survey from 394 employees working at 55 five-star hotels in the Al-Dawadmi region of Saudi Arabia. SmartPLS 4 was employed to examine underlying relationships. Findings Results showed that workplace romance positively influenced employee envy, negatively influenced thriving at work and intrinsic motivation, and positively affected turnover intention. Findings also showed that employee envy is a critical mediator between workplace romance and work-related outcomes (i.e. thriving at work, intrinsic motivation, and turnover intention). Further, results indicated that increased work autonomy attenuated the adverse effect of workplace romance on employee envy. Practical implications Our results apply to hospitality industry managers and policymakers. Hospitality organizations can eliminate employee envy and workplace romance, and their negative impact on motivation, performance, and retention, through workplace sharing, anti-passion, and oversight of workplace romance relationships. Originality/value This paper enhances existing studies by incorporating SCT and SDT to support interactions between workplace romance and employee outcomes. It also illuminates the boundary condition of work autonomy and contributes theoretically and practically to the hospitality management literature.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study explores the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on technical skills development, job insecurity, and system adoption within organisations. It examines how businesses can navigate AI-driven workplace transformations while mitigating workforce challenges and fostering a culture of trust and innovation. Design/methodology/approach The research adopts a mixed-method approach, combining theoretical analysis with empirical insights. Data were gathered from the AI-driven transformation Scopus database, analysing the relationship between AI implementation, employee perceptions, and organisational strategies for skill development and job security. Findings (1) AI has a dual impact: it increases demand for advanced technical skills while also heightening job insecurity, particularly in organisations lacking structured reskilling programs. (2) Organisations that integrate transparent governance and employee participation into AI adoption strategies experience lower resistance and higher acceptance. (3) A balance between technological advancement and human capital investment is critical for minimising disruptions and ensuring a smooth transition to AI-driven operations. Research limitations/implications The study is limited by the scope of available industry data and the generalisability of case study findings. Future research should explore sector-specific AI adoption challenges and long-term workforce adaptation strategies. Practical implications The findings offer actionable insights for organisational leaders and policymakers, emphasising the need for structured skill enhancement programs, transparent communication, and ethical AI governance frameworks. These measures reduce workforce resistance, enhance innovation, and facilitate equitable AI-driven transformation. Social implications By addressing concerns about job security and skill obsolescence, the study contributes to a more sustainable AI integration approach that promotes workforce adaptability, inclusion, and ethical decision-making in the digital era. Originality/value This research provides a novel perspective by integrating AI adoption, skill development, and job insecurity within the broader framework of organisational transformation. It offers a socio-technical view of AI-driven change, highlighting the importance of ethical considerations and participatory decision-making.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Extant research has generally confirmed the positive impact of cross-listing on corporate social responsibility (CSR), but most studies treat CSR as a holistic concept. This study disaggregates CSR into internal (towards employee) and external (towards societal and environmental) dimensions to investigate a critical question: Does cross-listing lead firms to prioritize external stakeholders at the expense of internal commitments, thereby creating a CSR imbalance, or does it foster a higher-order balance across both dimensions? Specifically, we investigate the effects of cross-listing on both internal and external CSR, as well as the underlying mechanisms and boundary conditions. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on data for Chinese A-share listed firms from 2008 to 2022, this study leverages the A + H cross-listing arrangement as a quasi-natural experiment. We employ a difference-in-differences model with multi-way fixed effects, based on 38,908 firm-year observations from 4,721 companies. Findings The results show that cross-listing does not induce a trade-off between internal and external CSR. Instead, it significantly enhances both dimensions, guiding firms toward a higher level of balance. A mechanism analysis further reveals that cross-listing provides resource empowerment by alleviating financing constraints and achieves governance optimization through the appointment of directors with foreign experience. These two pathways jointly ensure the parallel development of internal and external CSR. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive impact is stronger when the signaling value of CSR is more prominent (e.g. for firms with non-award-winning executives or under weak institutional supervision). The effect is also more significant when the long-term strategic value of CSR is fully activated (e.g. for firms led by internal successors or those classified as high-tech firms). Practical implications For managers, this study underscores the importance of developing CSR strategies that integrate both internal and external dimensions to avoid the risk of organizational hypocrisy. For policymakers, the findings suggest moving beyond one-size-fits-all incentives toward more differentiated and targeted policy instruments that can guide and support firms' internal and external CSR practices separately, thereby enhancing the sustainable competitiveness of Chinese firms in global capital markets. Originality/value This study offers novel systematic evidence that cross-listing fosters the synergistic development of internal and external CSR, addressing long-standing concerns about CSR imbalance. It further identifies resource empowerment and governance optimization as two critical transmission mechanisms. Finally, by uncovering contextual contingencies, this study provides a more nuanced perspective on CSR decision-making, thereby advancing both theoretical debates and managerial practice.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this paper introduces the Experiential Growth Literature Review (EGLR), a novel methodological approach applying Positive Autoethnography (PosAE) principles to literature review processes. EGLR addresses a critical gap in mental health and healthcare research: how practitioners and researchers can create literature reviews that honor both scholarly rigor and experiential wisdom, documenting intellectual growth alongside content mastery. This approach counters skepticism by demonstrating that integrating experiential insights can uphold academic standards, making the hidden learning journey visible while maintaining rigor. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on PosAE’s three foundational principles – purpose-driven inquiry, positive reflexivity and experiential focus – the authors develop EGLR’s structure, procedures and quality criteria. The methodology maintains 70% traditional content (accurate synthesis, critical analysis and proper citation) while adding 30% reflexive documentation of learning journeys. EGLR applies post-traumatic growth frameworks to literature engagement contexts, documenting growth across five domains: relating to scholars/ideas, discovering new possibilities, developing intellectual strength, experiencing paradigmatic shifts and appreciating the knowledge journey. The authors position EGLR relative to other established review typologies, demonstrating it represents an orthogonal dimension – addressing reviewer positioning rather than evidence type or synthesis method. Detailed procedures include three phases: preparation (articulating purpose and selecting frameworks), engaged reading (traditional activities plus reflexive documentation) and analysis/writing (content synthesis integrated with growth documentation). Findings EGLR reveals insights about knowledge synthesis typically invisible in conventional reviews. The approach enables mental health practitioners transitioning to research to bridge experiential and scholarly knowledge authentically. PhD students can document intellectual development alongside content mastery, demonstrating emerging expertise through learning journeys rather than performed certainty. Researchers engaging emotionally difficult topics (trauma, moral injury and loss) can integrate their responses productively rather than professionally suppressing them. The 70/30 balance maintains scholarly standards while validating that positioned inquiry generates insights unavailable through false neutrality. Strategic voice shifting between third person (traditional content) and first person (reflexive elements) creates reviews that are both rigorous and revealing. Research limitations/implications EGLR is newly developed with minimal empirical validation. The 70/30 balance requires testing across contexts to ensure broad applicability. Clarifying how EGLR can be adapted or validated in diverse cultural or research settings will enhance its relevance. Future research should include application studies, quality criteria validation, comparative effectiveness research and cross-cultural adaptation studies. Time requirements exceed traditional reviews by an estimated 25%–50%, but understanding contextual transferability will support wider adoption and validation. Practical implications Mental health practitioners conducting research can position their clinical expertise as epistemological resource rather than bias to overcome. Doctoral students gain methodology for documenting learning authentically. Interdisciplinary researchers can make visible the substantial intellectual work of synthesizing across paradigms. Those researching personally relevant topics can integrate experience productively. EGLR provides immediately usable procedures, quality criteria and multiple examples demonstrating application across mental health contexts including trauma research, practitioner-researcher development and doctoral education. Social implications EGLR challenges assumptions about objectivity and neutrality in mental health research. By validating experiential knowledge and documenting growth through literature engagement, EGLR promotes social inclusion of practitioner voices in research, values lived experience expertise and democratizes knowledge production. The methodology supports recovery-oriented research approaches and positions service users and practitioners as legitimate knowledge producers. Originality/value This paper makes three original contributions to literature review methodology. First, it introduces EGLR as the inaugural application of PosAE to systematic knowledge synthesis, demonstrating that positioned inquiry can maintain scholarly standards while generating insights unavailable through false neutrality. Second, it operationalizes post-traumatic growth frameworks for literature engagement contexts, translating Tedeschi and Calhoun’s (2004) five domains into intellectual development indicators. Third, it positions EGLR as an orthogonal dimension to Grant and Booth’s (2009) established typology, clarifying that EGLR addresses reviewer development and positioning rather than evidence type or synthesis method, thereby expanding – not replacing – existing methodological options for healthcare researchers.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose People with disabilities (PwD) continue to be underrepresented in the labour market despite worldwide legislation protecting their labour rights. Previous studies have shown that gender diversity at upper corporate levels may be positively related to the hiring of other diverse minority groups. Based on the “upper echelon” and “social role” theories, the present article endeavours to examine the manner in which the inclusion of PwD in organisations is influenced by gender diversity at two distinct levels: the firms' boards of directors and the top management teams (TMTs). Design/methodology/approach Our research setting is grounded in a panel dataset of 1,745 European public companies from all productive sectors for the period 2007–2018. We conducted a longitudinal study using this panel data, drawn from the Refinitiv ESG database of Thomson Reuters Eikon to test the hypotheses. Findings Our results support a positive and significant association between the gender diversity of the boards and TMTs and the proportion of PwD hired by each organisation. We expand knowledge regarding the effect of gender diversity in leadership on inclusive actions of business diversity, focusing on the specific dimension of disability. Originality/value We carried out a quantitative empirical study, which to our knowledge is the first to research this relationship at the two highest levels of a firm, analysing how the vulnerable group of PwD could benefit from the influence that women members of a board and TMT can exert to facilitate their hiring and take advantage of their talent and abilities, adopting an inclusive organisational culture.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose In this study, lake pigments were tested in water-based flexo printing inks and their printability potential was determined. This study aims to support environmentally friendly production by promoting the use of natural plant-based materials and to contribute to the existing literature in this field. Design/methodology/approach Solutions were prepared using KAI(SO4)2.12H2O and K2CO3 to produce natural lake pigments from plants. Pigments were obtained from the plants by forming precipitates from the solutions. Each natural pigment extraction was tested as a colorant in a water-based flexographic printing ink. Test prints were taken on woodfree uncoated paper. The printability properties of the pigments were determined by conducting L*a*b* color values, gloss measurements and light fastness tests on the test prints. Findings The gloss results of the test prints indicate that the gloss values of the natural pigments range between 2.0 and 2.7. The light fastness values of the extracted pigments range from 1 to 3 according to the Blue Wool Scale. Among the samples, X1, X3 and X16 exhibited the highest lightfastness performance, with a value of 3. The L*a*b* color values and gloss values indicate that the colors are light in tone and low in gloss, while the light fastness results show that the X1, X3 and X16 pigments are slightly more resistant to fading. As a result of printability tests, it was determined that plant-based natural pigments X1, X3, X4, X12 and X14, which were extracted, are close to water-based light pastel Pantone color tones and can be used in water-based flexo inks. Originality/value The originality of this study lies in the use of 16 different plants for natural pigment production and the investigation of their applicability as colorants in water-based flexographic printing inks and their printability potential.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This article aims to describe the role of critical discourse analysis and intersectionality in our analysis and interpretation process and expand on the contribution of members of Black communities in the design of data-collection instruments, recruitment and data-collection procedures. We seek to provide readers with an instance on the utilization of critical social inquiry and how to involve members of communities under study in research procedures. Design/methodology/approach In the last few decades, public health research has experienced a shift in its research designs and methods. An increasing number of studies have focused on examining minority populations’ experiences grounded in critical social inquiry and incorporated members of those communities in roles beyond “participant.” Intersectionality, which is both an approach to critical social inquiry and a form of praxis, was the theoretical lens of a critical discourse study on Black communities lived experience with opioid overdose response. Findings This paper draws mainly of three aspects of qualitative inquiry in public health research. First, it shows how to utilize intersectionality and critical discourse analysis in analysis processes of the experiences and narratives of Black communities. It also demonstrates how members of those communities can be involved in different processes of the research process, making public health research more inclusive and culturally responsive. Moreover, it unpacks the multiple elements that interplay in the data analysis workflow. Originality/value Research in public health today requires the implementation of more holistic and culturally sensitive research designs and analysis frameworks, especially when the subjects under study are underrepresented groups. Critical social inquiry provides researchers with the flexibility and rigor required to thoroughly understand phenomena related to discrimination in all its forms. The authors highlight the importance of the involvement of members of minorities under study in the hope of better research practices and community informed solutions.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study explores the meaning of being multicultural among international graduates of English-language management programs in Poland. Additionally, it examines how these individuals perceive the opportunities and challenges their multicultural identity brings to their professional lives. Design/methodology/approach Eleven participants took part in two waves of semi-structured interviews, conducted two years apart, during which they created cultural identity maps as part of a reflexive interview exercise focused on their multiple cultural identities. Findings Most participants identified as bicultural or multicultural, though they differed in how certain they were about being multicultural and how they interpreted its meaning. Some strongly embraced their multicultural identity, while others viewed it as a dynamic process shaped by their environment and life experiences. Moreover, interviewees predominantly viewed their multicultural identity as beneficial in professional settings, highlighting enhanced adaptability, improved communication skills, and advantages in cross-cultural business interactions. Several graduates demonstrated cultural variability, consciously adjusting aspects of their cultural identities depending on the context, which served as a professional asset. However, some participants faced challenges related to adaptation or issues tied to gender and religion. Practical implications The study offers recommendations for educational institutions to develop multicultural competencies and for organizations to create enabling conditions that leverage the unique capabilities of multicultural employees. Originality/value These findings suggest that multicultural identity can serve as a strategic toolkit in professional settings, empowering individuals to navigate diverse workplace environments. However, its expression may be shaped by various social factors and organizational contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This paper aims to explore Dialogic Accounting and Accountability (DAA) processes in setting up and collectively managing two New European Bauhaus (NEB) projects, with direct connections to the social and environmental goals of the European Green Deal (EGD). Design/methodology/approach This study uses an autoethnographic approach, which includes three years of participant observations and field notes, 16 semi-structured interviews with project stakeholders and production and analysis of documents and reports. Findings The projects must be understood holistically as tackling the three pillars of NEB: sustainability, esthetics and inclusion. DAA processes can enhance the success of grassroots-led NEB projects when accountability is understood not as a process ending with formal project reporting, but as an ongoing, participatory dynamic that continues beyond the official conclusion of the project. Practical implications According to the present findings, DAA helps align community needs with the transformative goals of European projects, thereby strengthening accountability mechanisms. NEB projects can support the direct application of DAA principles for their multilayered accountability structure, which emphasizes the mutual accountability between citizens and institutions. Social implications This study provides elements to corroborate the social dimension of the EGD. It also promotes an inclusive approach to community accountability that incorporates diverse perspectives and values in collectively managing projects. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts to autoethnographically analyze, from an accountability perspective, community NEB projects over a lengthy period. It provides a detailed account of a relatively recent initiative that has been primarily studied in other fields.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to examine the role of limited-edition packaging (LEP) in shaping consumer–brand relationships in food marketing, focusing on limited-stock scarcity (LSS) and limited-time scarcity (LTS) cues. It explores their effects on emotions, social class congruence (SCC), brand value, loyalty and willingness to pay a premium (WPP), with differences across local and international brands. Design/methodology/approach Two between-subjects experiments with food consumers (n = 237; 228) tested the direct, mediating and moderating effects of LEP cues using covariance-based structural equation modeling and ANOVA analyses. Findings LSS cues evoke stronger emotional attachment, whereas LTS cues enhance SCC. Both scarcity appeals elevate perceived brand value, fostering loyalty and WPP. The effects are more pronounced for international food brands, where LSS packaging strengthens emotional bonds and perceived value. Serial mediation through emotional attachment and perceived value was supported, except for the SCC–loyalty path. Originality/value This study advances understanding of how packaging scarcity cues shape consumer emotions and social perceptions. By integrating emotional attachment and SCC into a unified model, it offers practical insights for leveraging LEP to enhance brand performance across local and international food markets.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to explore how menopause is recognised, recorded and treated in women with intellectual disability receiving care from community learning disability services. It sought to identify gaps in diagnosis, treatment provision and access to routine health checks, as well as regional disparities across a NHS Trust in the Northwest of England. Design/methodology/approach A retrospective cohort study was conducted using routinely collected clinical data from 555 women aged 40–60 with intellectual disability, obtained from electronic health records across multiple community learning disability teams. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed to examine menopause diagnosis rates, treatment patterns and annual health check (AHC) participation. Findings Only 4% of women had a recorded diagnosis of menopause or perimenopause. However, a greater proportion received menopause-related interventions, indicating a potential gap in formal recognition. The use of Hormone Replacement Therapy varied significantly across regions, with less than half of eligible women having had an AHC. Practical implications Findings support the need for accessible screening tools, workforce education and equitable service commissioning. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first studies to audit menopause care for women with intellectual disability at scale using data from electronic patient records. The findings highlight systemic under-recognition, inconsistent documentation and inequities in access to care, calling for improved screening, professional training and inclusive policy responses.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic, intensely pruritic dermatosis driven by neuroimmune dysregulation for which targeted therapies are emerging. The objective of our study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Janus kinase inhibitors (JAK‐Is) for the treatment of PN. We conducted a systematic search in sources including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase; the search was completed on September 9, 2025. Inclusion criteria were the use of any JAK‐I in a patient with confirmed PN, and exclusion criteria were reviews, duplicate reports, and studies with incomplete outcome data. Risk of bias was assessed using the NHLBI quality assessment tools for observational studies and the Murad et al. checklist for case reports and case series. Ten clinical studies ( n = 180 patients) and 21 case reports/series ( n = 31 patients) were included (total n = 211). Agents evaluated included upadacitinib, tofacitinib, abrocitinib, and baricitinib. Applying standardized response criteria, 139/180 patients (77.2%) in clinical studies achieved meaningful clinical improvement. Rapid itch relief was frequently observed (days to weeks). Quality of life improved substantially (mean reduction from 20.4 to 3.9). Reported adverse events were generally mild (infections, laboratory abnormalities, dyslipidemia, acneiform eruption); serious events were rare. Limitations include small sample sizes, predominance of uncontrolled and observational designs, heterogeneity of outcomes, and limited long‐term safety data. Current evidence suggests JAK‐Is are highly effective and generally well tolerated for PN, warranting larger randomized controlled trials with extended follow‐up.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Ritlecitinib is an oral JAK3/TEC family kinase inhibitor approved for individuals aged ≥ 12 years with severe alopecia areata. Here we report interim efficacy and safety results with ritlecitinib up to Month 24 in the Asian subpopulation from the ALLEGRO phase 2b/3 and ALLEGRO‐LT studies. Data are reported for participants with Severity of Alopecia Tool score ≥ 50 who received ritlecitinib 50 mg with (200/50‐mg group) or without (50‐mg group) an initial 4‐week 200‐mg daily loading dose in ALLEGRO‐2b/3, and continued ritlecitinib 50 mg in ALLEGRO‐LT. In long‐term studies, it is common for summaries at later time points to reflect participants who remained in the study, tolerated the drug, and had a positive treatment response. To account for this, efficacy summaries were presented both as observed and by using the last observation carried forward method. At Month 12, 51.7% and 44.7% (last observation carried forward) of Asian participants in the 50‐mg ( n = 58) and 200/50‐mg groups ( n = 47), respectively, achieved Severity of Alopecia Tool score ≤ 20 (≤ 20% scalp hair loss); the respective proportions were 50.0% and 47.8% at Month 24. Of participants who achieved Severity of Alopecia Tool score ≤ 20 at Month 12 in the 50‐mg and 200/50‐mg groups, 68.2% and 86.7% sustained this response through Month 24, respectively. At Month 12, 74.0% and 57.9% of participants in the 50‐mg and 200/50‐mg groups, respectively, had an eyebrow hair regrowth response; at Month 24, the proportions were 72.0% and 48.7%. At Month 12, 65.1% and 54.1% of participants in the 50‐mg and 200/50‐mg groups, respectively, had an eyelash hair regrowth response; the proportions were 65.1% and 52.8% at Month 24. The proportion of participants with a Patients' Global Impression of Change response of “moderately” or “greatly” improved since baseline increased through Month 24 in both groups. Ritlecitinib had an acceptable safety profile, consistent with that in the overall population. Overall, ritlecitinib 50 mg (±200‐mg loading dose) demonstrated clinically meaningful and sustained efficacy through Month 24 in the Asian subpopulation, consistent with results in the overall population.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Treating children with a cleft palate with or without a cleft lip (CP±L) requires an interdisciplinary approach. While this coordinated, long‐term treatment approach intends to enhance children's quality of life (QoL), it may still be perceived as burdensome for the children and their environment. Aims This study investigated the perspectives of both children with a CP±L and their parents, with a particular focus on the psychological and financial impact of interdisciplinary cleft treatment. Methods A total of 10 parents (mean age of 48.0 years) and 7 children with CP±L (mean age of 14.3 years) were recruited via the interdisciplinary cleft team of Ghent University Hospital and social media outreach. As a pilot study, the small sample was intentionally selected to enable in‐depth qualitative exploration. An independent interviewer conducted seven semi‐structured interviews with the child and parent(s) simultaneously, collecting data until data saturation was reached. An inductive thematic approach was used to analyse the data. To enhance the confirmability, credibility and transferability of the research findings, researcher triangulation and member checks were conducted. Results The analyses of the interviews revealed four major themes of importance to the children and their parents: (1) managing treatment costs, including costs related to hospitalization insurance and out‐of‐pocket therapy and treatments; (2) emotional journey through diagnosis and surgery, particularly around navigating the diagnosis, pre‐surgical anxiety and reflections on surgical necessity and adjustment; (3) collaborative care experiences, encompassing experiences with cleft team support, time investment and perceived freedom of treatment choice and (4) acceptance and adaptation, including children's positive adjustment and parents’ coping strategies. Conclusions Findings revealed that interdisciplinary treatment influences more than just financial and medical aspects of cleft care, but also perceived QoL of children with CP±L and their parents. The way participants perceive CP±L plays a key role in shaping their experience of the associated burdens. Despite the described challenges, such as the emotional toll and significant financial burden associated with interdisciplinary treatment, participants recognized its benefits, particularly improvements in appearance and functionality, which serve as strong motivation for continuing treatment. Their accounts illustrate the importance of integrating psychosocial support, such as counselling before and after surgeries, and practical financial guidance to help families manage treatment costs. By capturing the voices of both children and parents, our findings provide concrete evidence for designing interventions that reduce stress, enhance understanding, and improve family coping during the treatment trajectory. Practitioner Points Speech and language therapy represents a central component of cleft care and also contribute to families’ financial and time burden. Speech‐language pathologists (SLPs) should be aware of these pressures and consider how flexible service delivery models might help reduce strain. Interdisciplinary care for children with CP±L places substantial emotional and financial demands on families. As integral members of cleft teams, SLPs can help ease these pressures through consistent communication, family education and coordination with other professionals, ensuring that speech and communication goals remain prioritized alongside surgical or medical care. Understanding the broader context of treatment burden helps SLPs deliver more family‐centred care. By acknowledging financial, emotional and practical challenges, SLPs can tailor intervention approaches to enhance engagement, resilience and long‐term communicative outcomes. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS What is already known on this subject Treating children with a cleft palate with or without a cleft lip (CP±L) requires an interdisciplinary approach aimed at improving their quality of life (QoL). Treatment typically involves surgeries and non‐surgical interventions such as speech therapy and orthodontics. Previous insights indicate that interdisciplinary treatment can be perceived as burdensome due to factors such as financial costs, emotional strain and the time investment required. Furthermore, the experiences and perceptions of children and parents play a critical role in how they view the benefits and challenges of treatment. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study addresses a gap in current evidence by exploring experiences of children with CP±L and their parents, which have been under‐researched qualitatively. While previous studies identified financial, emotional and time‐related burdens of interdisciplinary care, limited insight exists into how families perceive and make sense of these challenges in their daily lives. Our findings show that families’ perceptions, such as viewing treatment as worthwhile despite its demands, strongly influence their coping and adaptation to long‐term care. This qualitative perspective complements quantitative research by offering a deeper understanding of the subjective dimensions of treatment burden and motivation for continued care. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? This study highlights the importance for a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to cleft treatment that addresses medical, emotional and financial challenges. While service‐wide collaboration and shared decision‐making are essential, speech‐language pathologists (SLPs) play a key role in providing empathetic communication, supporting family resilience, and managing treatment expectations. These insights are also relevant for SLPs in other domains, demonstrating how integrating patient and parent perspectives can enhance family‐centred practice. By combining individual support with coordinated teamwork, SLPs can help reduce treatment burdens and contribute to improved long‐term outcomes for children and their families.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Rice (Oryza sativa, Oryza glaberrima) is a globally essential staple, providing vital nutrients such as carbohydrates, fiber, proteins, vitamins, and minerals. However, conventional processing methods (e.g., milling, parboiling) often degrade its physicochemical and nutritional properties, causing loss of essential components.This systematic review critically examines the potential of cold plasma (CP), an emerging non‐thermal technology, for enhancing rice quality. Following PRISMA guidelines, an extensive literature search was conducted using databases including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. The review highlights the effects of CP on rice grain structure, starch and protein behavior, and key techno‐functional and nutritional attributes. CP treatment improves water absorption, reduces cooking time, and modifies starch gelatinization and pasting profiles. It also enhances protein solubility, emulsification properties, and textural characteristics, thus enhancing the sensory and functional profile of rice‐based products. From a nutritional approach, CP contributes to increased nutrient bioavailability and reduction of anti‐nutritional factors, while also offering microbial decontamination and shelf‐life extension. CP represents a promising, energy and cost‐efficient alternative to conventional thermal processing. Its ability to preserve and enhance nutritional and functional properties without compromising impact on sensory quality makes it an ideal tool in sustainable rice grain processing and value‐added grain innovation.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT With the intensification of the global plastic pollution crisis and the escalation of consumers’ concern for food safety, marine polysaccharide‐based intelligent food packaging (MPIFP) materials have become a research hotspot in the field of food science due to their renewability, degradability, and multifunctionality. Marine polysaccharides are mainly used to construct functionalized network structures through three cross‐linking methods (physical, chemical, and enzymatic cross‐linking), thereby forming films. In addition, traditional and novel preparation techniques offer diverse options for the preparation of marine polysaccharide‐based films (MPFs). The introduction of indicators, sensors, and data carriers can endow MPFs with intelligent response properties, which contribute to them demonstrating great potential in monitoring food quality, extending shelf life, and providing consumer information. Currently, MPIFP has commercial cases. However, the industrialization of MPIFP still faces many challenges. Hence, this paper systematically reviews the molecular properties of marine polysaccharides and introduces the film‐forming mechanisms and preparation techniques of MPFs. In addition, this review illustrates the innovative applications of MPFs in intelligent packaging. Furthermore, this paper systematically reviews the current status of intelligent packaging technology in the commercial field, as well as the advantages and industrialization challenges of MPFs. This review innovatively integrates the film‐forming mechanism of marine polysaccharides, advanced preparation techniques, and their multifunctional integrated applications in indicators, sensors, and data carriers, and addresses the practical issues of industrialization, which provides cross‐disciplinary and full‐chain theoretical references and practical guidance for the material design, process optimization, and commercialization path of MPFs.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Slow transit constipation (STC) is a chronic colonic motility disorder characterized by markedly delayed transit, leading to reduced bowel movements, abdominal discomfort, and significant quality‐of‐life impairment. It predominantly affects women and is associated with abnormalities in enteric neuronal signaling, smooth muscle contractility, interstitial cells of Cajal, gut peptides, bile acid homeostasis, and autonomic regulation. Secondary causes of constipation and structural lesions must be excluded before the diagnosis of STC, with colonic transit studies serving as the gold standard. Complementary investigations such as anorectal manometry and defecography help detect coexisting outlet obstruction, which can alter management. The treatment of STC should follow a stepwise approach, beginning with dietary and lifestyle modification, osmotic and stimulant laxatives, and prokinetics such as prucalopride. Secretagogues and bile acid modulators may offer additional benefit. Biofeedback therapy is primarily indicated for overlapping dyssynergic defecation. For refractory STC, interventional therapies, such as fecal microbiota transplantation, acupuncture, sacral nerve stimulation, and transanal irrigation, are found to have equivocal outcomes. Antegrade continence enema procedures can be an alternative for patients unsuitable for colectomy. Surgical options, including subtotal colectomy with ileosigmoid or cecorectal anastomosis, and total colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis, are reserved for carefully selected patients with medically intractable symptoms, following thorough physiological evaluation. Although advances in understanding STC pathophysiology are guiding novel therapeutic development, robust randomized controlled trials remain scarce. Optimal care requires multidisciplinary collaboration between gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, and pelvic floor specialists to ensure accurate diagnosis, tailored treatment, and improved long‐term outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Armed conflicts and humanitarian crises across Africa generate profound yet understudied ecological consequences, reshaping ecosystems through complex processes of degradation and regeneration. This review synthesises evidence from across the continent to examine how warfare, displacement, and refugee settlements alter land use, biodiversity, and conservation outcomes. Conflicts weaken governance, disrupt protected area management, and enable illegal logging, mining, poaching, and unsustainable resource extraction, driving deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and wildlife decline. Refugee settlements, often located near ecologically sensitive areas, intensify pressures on forests, water, and arable land through high demand for fuelwood, food, and construction materials. Quantitative studies, including standardised biodiversity surveys in northern Uganda, reveal striking declines in amphibian, reptile, and plant diversity in refugee‐impacted areas compared to nearby controls. Moreover, empirical evidence from Central and East Africa documents sharp increases in bushmeat trade and consumption during and after periods of armed instability. Yet conflict can also produce paradoxical positive effects, where human abandonment allows vegetation recovery and wildlife resurgence, as documented in Mozambique's Gorongosa National Park and other war‐affected landscapes. These contrasting dynamics highlight the dual role of conflict as both a driver of ecological collapse and a catalyst for ecosystem resilience. Integrating social science, ecology, and conflict studies is essential to develop conservation strategies that address both human welfare and biodiversity protection. By framing conflict and displacement as intertwined socio‐ecological processes, our study highlights the urgent need for interdisciplinary approaches to manage Africa's vulnerable ecosystems under conditions of chronic instability.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Classical bioethics examines moral issues in terrestrial medicine and the life sciences. According to Konrad Szocik, space bioethics merely relocates those questions to harsher environments. We argue that this view is incomplete: space bioethics is a genuinely original domain. Unprecedented conditions—chronic radiation exposure, partial gravity, closed ecologies, long communication delays, and severe resource constraints—reconfigure risk and responsibility. Survival‐oriented interventions—human bio‐enhancement, human‐machine integration, germline editing for adaptation and off‐world reproduction (potentially via ectogenesis)—pose dilemmas with no close terrestrial analogue. Moreover, some technologies may be developed and adopted in space before diffusion to Earth, generating ethical challenges in advance. These scenarios strain the portability of standard moral norms and cannot be addressed by simply importing frameworks from military or extreme‐environment medicine.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study employed critical discursive and rhetorical psychology to analyse the discourses drawn upon to justify an arguably violent protest outside a previously disused hotel in rural Ireland, where 34 male asylum seekers had been accommodated. Interviews with protesters and public representatives were retrieved from three mainstream media platforms. The protesters drew on three contradictory and deracialized discursive strategies to inoculate their justification for the protest against accusations of prejudice, which we label compassionate exclusion. The first is a compassionate concern about the suitability of the accommodation for the asylum seekers, whilst engaging in collective action to force the asylum seekers into homelessness and risk of further violence. The second positions the protesters as compassionate towards the asylum seekers whilst demanding that they receive vetting and that the local community receive prior consultation on their suitability for accommodation. The third presents the ‘male’ asylum seekers as a threat to women in this isolated rural community, even though the protesters position themselves as compassionate towards the ‘lovely men’ who are already accommodated. This highlights how compassionate humanitarian concerns can be co‐opted to justify an arguably violent demand for the forced removal and exclusion of asylum seekers, whilst avoiding accusations of racism.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Women remain underrepresented in leadership, particularly in traditionally masculine work settings. At the same time, the visibility of this imbalance has led to growing calls for diversifying leadership. This research examines how both men and women contribute to the preservation or disruption of gender inequality in masculine organizational contexts. Men remain the gatekeepers of change—deciding who rises to the top and under what conditions—while women face the strategic dilemma of fitting in by downplaying inequality (supporting the status quo, sometimes called ‘queen bee behaviour’) or ‘rocking the boat’ by advocating social change (challenging the status quo). Across five experimental studies (total N = 887), we examined how evaluators assessed male and female leadership candidates who either supported or challenged the status quo. Results revealed that although men favoured female over male candidates, they consistently preferred women who reinforced the status quo over those who advocated equality. By contrast, male candidates who supported the status quo were penalized, and female evaluators showed no such preferences. These findings highlight subtle mechanisms through which gendered power dynamics are maintained, underscoring both the strategic trade‐offs women must navigate to advance and the conditional nature of men's support for gender equality.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Diffuse hemispheric glioma, H3 G34‐mutant (DHG‐H3 G34) has been primarily molecularly characterized by methylation profiling and sequencing studies. We describe an integrated histomolecular evaluation including high‐resolution copy number profiling of a series of 60 DHG‐H3 G34 to further our understanding of the spectrum of genetic changes associated with this tumor type. Cases were clinically tested using an 187‐gene mutation and fusion targeted neuro‐oncology next‐generation sequencing panel ( n = 60) and Oncoscan chromosomal microarray ( n = 26) by a single laboratory (2018–2022). A subset of cases had immunohistochemical results for OLIG2 ( n = 42), p53 ( n = 48), and ATRX ( n = 46), and methylation array data ( n = 8). Median age at testing was 21 years (range, 12–50). No significant difference was noted in clinical, histopathological, and mutational profile between pediatric and adult patients. H3‐3A G34 mutations included G34R ( n = 56; 94%), G34V ( n = 3), and a non‐canonical G34E ( n = 1). Concurrent mutations most often involved TP53 ( n = 55; 92%), ATRX ( n = 50; 83%), and PDGFRA ( n = 34; 57%). A reportedly primary tumor was confirmed to be hypermutant and had a PMS2 mutation. A single case also showed an FGFR3::FAM184B fusion. All cases with available chromosomal microarray data had unbalanced genomes, which were often complex (14/26; 54%). The most frequent recurrent copy number abnormalities were losses involving 3q, 4q, 10q, 13q, and 18q, and 17p copy‐neutral loss of heterozygosity (cnLOH) encompassing TP53 . This copy number profile was reminiscent of that seen in Grade 4 IDH‐mutant astrocytomas. Collectively, a TP53 abnormality at copy number (12/26, all cnLOH), sequence (55/60) and protein expression (46/48) level was detected in all 60 cases. In conclusion, integrated high‐resolution copy number and histomolecular analysis expanded the spectrum of genetic changes associated with DHG‐H3 G34, including the presence of universal TP53 abnormalities with frequent cnLOH—a copy number abnormality that has been largely unrecognized—for this new 2021 World Health Organization central nervous system tumor type.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Following large‐scale threatening events, a key challenge is to rapidly establish which species have been most affected and are in need of urgent conservation. For data‐poor taxa, such assessments are challenging. In Australia, invertebrates represent over 90% of faunal diversity and are critical for ecosystem function, yet most are undescribed, and, of the described, most are poorly known. Thus, it is important to have a way to estimate susceptibility to major disturbance of data‐deficient taxa. We developed a novel trait‐based method for assessing the impact of a major wildfire on invertebrates. We applied it to 1220 species that showed high distributional overlap with the 2019–2020 Australian megafires. We estimated susceptibility based on the microhabitat species occupy, their life‐history and ecological traits, and mechanisms that account for key data uncertainties (number of usable occurrence records, availability of traits data, and recency of taxonomic work). We found 748 species likely to be of potential conservation concern following the megafires; 169, 579, and 454 were highly, moderately, and mildly threatened by a major fire, respectively. Most species (867) were associated with poor or very poor data quality. Of the 867 poorly known species, 97 were most at risk from a major fire. Our approach is generalizable to other data‐deficient taxa and to major disturbance events globally and can be used to improve representation of poorly known species in conservation assessments and threat mitigation decisions. If the uncertainties and knowledge gaps we identified are addressed, it is likely risk prediction could be improved.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This article explores longstanding conflict between Turkana and Pokot pastoralist communities in northern Kenya, close to the country's border with Uganda. Conflict in this region has consistently defied interventions by both governments and development organisations. While numerous studies have emphasised the worsening situation, often in relation to climate change and ensuing forms of resource scarcity, few have illuminated the intricate connections between the commercialisation of livestock theft and other forms of politically motivated, territorial resource‐based violence. To address this gap in existing analyses of conflict in the pastoral borderlands, the article draws on four years of fieldwork, employing mixed‐method approaches, including participatory community videos, to understand the dynamics of conflict. By situating shifting patterns of violence within the context of northern Kenya's reconfiguration as a frontier of anticipation, the article underscores the complexity and the multidimensional nature of this violence, arguing that solutions must be more attuned to the evolving realities of the borderlands.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aphid species that test positive for plant viruses in reverse transcription‐PCR (RT‐PCR) analysis are not necessarily vectors. This is because virus RNA can also be detected in non‐vector aphid species using this method. Potato virus Y (PVY) has been previously detected using RT‐PCR from three common weed‐infesting alate aphid species, Aphis fukii Shinji, Aphis oenotherae Oestlund, and Capitophorus hippophaes javanicus Hille Ris Lambers, trapped in potato fields in Hokkaido, northern Japan. However, these three taxa are not known as PVY vectors, and it remains unclear whether they acquired PVY from their respective host plants or other common weeds. Therefore, we conducted two experiments: (i) transmission experiments of these aphids using Myzus persicae (Sulzer), a species widely regarded as the most efficient PVY vector, as a reference species, and (ii) virus susceptibility experiments of typical host plant species of the three aphid species and other common weed species in and around potato fields in Hokkaido. The transmission experiments showed that the PVY‐transmission efficiency of A . fukii and A. oenotherae was not significantly different from that of M. persicae . In contrast, C. hippophaes javanicus did not transmit PVY. The estimated maximum transmission efficiency by one aptera was 7.5%. Mechanical inoculations and field sampling revealed that the tested weed species were not susceptible to PVY. These findings suggest that A . fukii and A. oenotherae serve as common and efficient PVY vectors in potato fields in Hokkaido, despite their individual transmission efficiency being &lt; 7.5%. They likely acquire PVY from infected potato plants and/or unidentified reservoirs. These novel insights can advance our understanding of PVY epidemiology in Japan and contribute to the development of more effective vector‐based control strategies against PVY.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Mechanical dispersion is driven by a variance in velocity rather than by the concentration gradient in the classical Fickian model. The groundwater community needs a theoretical development for this that offers a practical way to implement it (Konikow 2025). The method of Advective Transport Phenomena (De Lange 2020) describes mechanical dispersion based on the spread of water particles generated at sub‐model scale by advective flow through zones with conductivity different from that of the overall aquifer, leading to a new parameter in the dispersive mass flux which is added to the advective mass flux computed at model scale similar to the existing approach in numerical modeling. The new parameter, called dispersive volume shift, is determined only by the traveled distance and the aquifer heterogeneity described by the horizontal and the vertical characteristic length and the log conductivity variance. The dispersive mass flux combines the dispersive volume shift and the concentration difference which is proportional to the traveled distance per time step. Using a spreadsheet model, the longitudinal concentration distribution in a traveling plume is simulated in a homogeneous aquifer and in a heterogeneous aquifer. The latter case shows asymmetry in the plume growth which is not produced by a classical Fickian model. Developments are still needed for application in general numerical modeling.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Research on the critically endangered European eel ( Anguilla anguilla L.) has long been focused on the continental part of the species' wide distribution. Comparatively, we know very little about its ecology in the small stream habitats of the oceanic Macaronesian islands and whether it differs from that of continental estuaries, rivers and lakes. We used acoustic telemetry to investigate the movements of 36 yellow‐staged eels for 1 year at a typical Azorean stream, with small pools below waterfalls interchanged by riffles and runs. Tagged eels had a restricted movement range and mostly stayed in a given pool. Such limited movements render this part of the population particularly susceptible to changes in the stream, which can seasonally run dry at some parts. These findings likely reflect the extreme habitat limitation in Azorean streams, and possibly an evolutionary adaptation to ensure growth under limited food supply and high competitive pressure. These specificities should be taken into account in future management plans for the European eel and its Azorean habitats.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to evaluate welfare and health effects following single and repeated non‐lethal blood sampling from the caudal vasculature of Atlantic salmon. Two experiments were conducted at three different temperatures: a 6‐week freshwater experiment with fish weighing 50–100 g, undergoing up to four blood withdrawals, and a 4‐week seawater experiment with fish weighing 300–450 g, undergoing up to three blood withdrawals. Observed clinical signs included dark pigmentation of the skin and vascular disturbances posterior to the puncture site. Histological evaluations revealed injuries to the vasculature, vertebral column, nervous tissue and skeletal muscle. At 12°C and 15°C, fish displayed strong capacity for tissue regeneration and haematological recovery, but also an elevated risk of acute mortality. At 5°C, acute mortality was minimal, but recovery time was approximately twice as long compared with higher temperatures. Mortality rates and clinical findings decreased with increasing fish weight. These findings demonstrate that non‐lethal caudal blood sampling poses a welfare risk in salmon weighing 450 g or less. The risk factors identified here may inform future risk assessments and support the development of welfare‐compatible guidelines for non‐lethal blood sampling in Atlantic salmon.",

We find that a 1 billion U.S. dollars (USD) purchase leads to a 0.82% depreciation of the Israeli Shekel (ILS)–a strong effect compared to other studies. We show that this effectiveness can partially be attributed to the limited risk‐taking capacity of global banks. The interventions also widen the negative deviation from covered interest parity and influence the higher‐order moments of risk‐neutral expectations derived from options prices. We find that USD purchases shift the USD/ILS distribution upward and reduce crash risk. Moreover, the options market anticipates and prices in upcoming interventions.",

The CIDPRIT trial found no clinical benefit in comparison with placebo, but secondary analyses suggested some beneficial effect. Analysis of serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) may provide evidence to support rituximab's effect on CIDP patients. Methods We performed a post hoc analysis of sNfL levels from the CIDPRIT trial participants. Blood samples were collected at baseline, month 6, and 12. sNfL was measured using Simoa technology. Geometric means and z‐scores were compared across groups. Linear mixed‐effects models and survival analyses were used to evaluate treatment effects and clinical correlations. Results 33 participants were included (18 rituximab, 15 placebo). Baseline sNfL was significantly higher in the rituximab group (11.51 vs. 6.67 pg/mL, p = 0.019). While between‐group differences over time were not statistically significant, rituximab‐treated patients showed stable sNfL levels at month 6 and a slight decrease at month 12, contrasting with modest increases in the placebo group. Among rituximab‐treated patients who remained clinically stable at month 12, sNfL showed a non‐significant decline by 31%. No significant associations were found between baseline sNfL and clinical worsening. NfL levels correlated with neurophysiological parameters of axonal damage. Interpretation The analysis did not demonstrate biomarker‐based evidence of rituximab efficacy in CIDP. However, observed trends suggest a possible biological effect in reducing axonal injury in a subset of patients. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of sNfL in treatment monitoring and patient stratification.",

Evidence on awake bruxism (AB) in this population remains scarce. Objective To assess the prevalence of awake bruxism (AB) and its associations with sociodemographic, behavioural, clinical and psychological factors, particularly anxiety and nomophobia, among esports practitioners. Methods In this cross‐sectional study, 239 esports players completed a structured online questionnaire covering sociodemographic/lifestyle factors, gaming‐related characteristics, clinical conditions, self‐reported sleep quality, temporomandibular pain screening, anxiety (GAD‐7) and nomophobia. Awake bruxism behaviours were assessed using the Oral Behaviours Checklist (OBC). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) was used to evaluate factors associated with AB frequency (never &lt; sometimes &lt; frequent). Additionally, separate ordinal models were fitted for each AB behaviour (grinding, clenching, light tooth contact and mandibular bracing) using the same frequency structure. Results Overall, 89.1% of participants reported AB‐related behaviours, with light tooth contact being the most frequent. In the multivariable model, higher nomophobia scores were independently associated with higher AB frequency categories (OR = 1.031; 95% CI = 1.015–1.050; p &lt; 0.001). In behaviour‐specific models, nomophobia consistently emerged as a significant predictor across individual AB behaviours. Anxiety and nomophobia were strongly correlated ( ρ = 0.650; p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion Awake bruxism‐related behaviours were highly prevalent among esports practitioners and nomophobia was consistently associated with higher AB frequency and specific AB manifestations. These findings highlight the relevance of psychobehavioral factors in the expression of AB in gamers.",

However, the effect of these exposures has been studied mainly in the adult population, and little is known about their combined effect on adolescents. The present study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by examining the combined effect of ALAN and noise on the quality of sleep of junior high and high school students. Study participants included 81 adolescents (age 13–18 years) living in Tamra, a town in northern Israel. A 41‐day experiment was carried out during which participants wore smartwatches, connected to Android smartphones, to monitor their exposures to ALAN and noise and their sleep patterns. The collected data were then analysed using statistical tools and showed that an increase in ALAN in a plausible range of 40–150 lx before sleep is estimated to reduce sleep efficiency (SE), all other factors being constant, by ~18% ( t &lt; −16, p &lt; 0.01), whilst an increase in noise from 30 to 60 dB was estimated to reduce SE by ~22% ( t &lt; −14, p &lt; 0.01). These estimates are higher than those found for the adult population in previous studies, according to which the effects of these environmental risk factors on sleep duration and quality were estimated to be ~8%–9%.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The objective of this study was to examine the impacts of obstetric violence (OV) on maternity healthcare professionals (MHPs) in Israel and the coping strategies they employ. This qualitative study was conducted in various maternity care settings across Israel. Data were collected through semi‐structured, in‐depth interviews with 21 MHPs, who had witnessed or had been involved in incidents of OV. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed thematically to identify key patterns related to the emotional and professional effects of OV, and to the coping strategies used by the participants. The analysis revealed two primary themes. The first relates to the consequences of exposure to OV on MHPs, including the impact on professional identity and functioning, emotional and psychological distress, and ambivalent responses to colleagues involved in such incidents. The second theme addresses MHPs' coping strategies such as disclosing incidents despite anticipated repercussions and feelings of isolation alongside coping through personal initiatives (raising awareness and promoting action regarding OV within and beyond the workplace). Findings highlight the imperative for a dual strategy: eradication of OV and providing meaningful support to all affected individuals, both the women subjected to OV and the MPHs exposed to or involved in such events.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Justice‐oriented critical care in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) requires nurses and the ICU team to recognize that suffering, vulnerability, and healing unfold within moral, social, and structural conditions. The PICU is one of the most ethically charged sites in healthcare, where children confront life‐threatening illness, and families confront fear, uncertainty, and power imbalances. This paper uses philosophical perspectives from distributive justice, relational ethics, phenomenology, and critical theory to analyze how justice can be strengthened in PICU practice. It identifies the main barriers that prevent equitable care, outlines the needs that must be addressed, and highlights opportunities to create a morally robust and socially accountable approach. Justice in the PICU cannot be reduced to fair allocation of resources or equal treatment. It must consider how children and families experience moral recognition, voice, respect, and compassion within a high acuity environment. This paper argues that the future of critical care nursing requires moving beyond rule‐based frameworks toward an embodied and relational understanding of justice that honors the lived realities of patients, families, nurses, and the healthcare team.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This critical discussion paper examines how the International Council of Nurses' (ICN) 2025 definition of “nurse” may shape nursing work by functioning as a discursive artifact and proposes the mid‐range concept of discursive burdening to help explain the potential downstream effects on nurses' labor. Grounded in Fairclough's critical discourse analysis (CDA) and the social ecology of nursing, this study analyzes the ICN definition alongside its explanatory report and selectively mapped it to scholarly, policy, and gray sources to illustrate how professional definitions can travel into practice. Using CDA tools, linguistic features of the text were linked to discourse and wider social practices. From the CDA of the ICN definition, the concept of discursive burdening emerges with three interrelated dimensions: (1) deontological dumping, (2) amorphous scope expansion, and (3) intensifying emancipatory labor. Mapped onto nursing's social ecology, these dynamics plausibly cascade through overlapping regulatory, bureaucratic, occupational, gender, and multi‐professional systems. The ICN report also names buffers that can diffuse these effects when made co‐present with the public definition, which includes legal conditionality, regulator mediation, contextualization, resource support, clarifying and sharing roles, and education/leadership investment.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background General practitioners (GPs) who take on the role of continuous medical education (CME) tutors play a vital part in facilitating small group learning among their peers. Despite the importance of this role, the personal experiences, motivations and unique challenges of CME tutors remain largely unknown. This study aimed to provide further insight into CME tutors' reflections on their role and professional identity formation. Methods A qualitative research approach, supported by two theoretical frameworks—identity and role theory—was employed. Thirteen CME tutors across Ireland participated in semi‐structured interviews conducted via Zoom. The interviews were analysed thematically. Findings Participants primarily identified themselves as GPs, but enthusiasm for peer learning and education led them to become CME tutors. They viewed their CME tutor role as deeply rewarding and enriching their clinical practice, reflective skills and identity as both doctors and educators. As CME tutors, they also embraced the role of ‘ go‐to’ person: being perceived as someone reliable and consistently supportive. The overlap between internal and external expectations often led to role strain, which was intensified by the informal expansion of role into areas beyond their remit, including helping with personal or practical issues of peers. Yet, our participants felt that the role of CME tutor embraced their personal and professional development, strengthening their commitment to medicine and education. Conclusion The career of CME tutors in Ireland was highly valued among participants; yet, additional support is needed to address role‐related challenges and ensure the long‐term attractiveness and sustainability of this vital professional path.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common complication in patients receiving broad‐spectrum antibiotics and causes significant morbidity, especially in solid organ transplant recipients. Oral vancomycin has shown potential for CDI prophylaxis, whereas metronidazole has been used solely for treatment; however, their effectiveness as primary prophylaxis remains uncertain. This study evaluates oral vancomycin or metronidazole prophylaxis in preventing primary CDI among lung transplant recipients (LTRs) during the index transplant admission. Methods We conducted a retrospective chart review of all LTRs at the University of Kentucky from January 2020 to May 2023. Patients were grouped based on whether they received primary CDI prophylaxis (oral vancomycin or metronidazole) during systemic antibiotic therapy at transplant. The primary outcome was the incidence of CDI during the index admission. Secondary outcomes included CDI incidence within 1 year post‐transplant and all‐cause mortality. Results Of 92 LTRs, 51 (55.4%) received prophylaxis and 41 (44.6%) did not. The incidence of CDI during the index admission was 2.0% (1/51) in the prophylaxis group and 2.4% (1/41) in the non‐prophylaxis group. Within 1 year, CDI incidence was 5.9% versus 2.4%, respectively ( p = 0.626). All‐cause mortality was significantly higher in the prophylaxis group (41.2% vs. 19.5%; p = 0.041), likely reflecting greater baseline illness severity and comorbidities. Conclusions Primary prophylaxis with oral vancomycin or metronidazole did not reduce CDI incidence among LTRs. Prophylaxis was more frequently used in patients with prolonged hospitalizations and longer antibiotic courses. Larger studies are needed to clarify the role of primary CDI prophylaxis in this high‐risk population.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background and Objectives Ageing populations in high‐income countries reduce the proportion of potential blood donors while increasing transfusion demand. Sustaining an adequate blood supply requires higher donor motivation among younger age groups. We analysed long‐term trends in whole blood donations (WBDs) in one German federal state as an indicator for challenges that may arise in other high‐income countries. Materials and Methods In our prospective longitudinal study (starting 2005), we obtained the age and sex of the donors of all WBDs in the German federal state Mecklenburg‐Western Pomerania in 2019 and 2020 and compared them with the data from 2005 to 2015. Population data from the German statistical office were used to predict future WBD in two models, population‐based and population‐based with behaviour‐adjusted prediction. Results WBD decreased from 118,419 in 2005 to 83,871 in 2019 (−29.2%) and 76,912 in 2020 (−35.1%). Donation rates per 1000 inhabitants declined by 19.1% between 2005 and 2019, indicating a loss of donor motivation beyond demographic effects. Based on the donation numbers of 2019, we predict a further decline of WBD in 2030 by −12.7% (population‐based projection) or −15.1% (behaviour‐adjusted projection), respectively. Conclusion The decline in blood donations is no longer solely driven by demographic changes but also by reduced motivation among younger donors. As ageing populations and changing donor behaviour are common to many high‐income countries, these findings likely reflect an emerging international trend. Targeted strategies to recruit and retain young donors are urgently needed to ensure sustainable blood supplies in ageing societies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Numerical simulations were performed to reconstruct heat flux and pressure measurements obtained in the Mach 6 arc-heated facility at the University of Tennessee, operated with nitrogen flow. In the experiments, stagnation-point heat flux and pitot pressure were measured at a bulk enthalpy of 6.8 MJ/kg and a total pressure of 170 kPa. The heat flux was determined using a flat-nose probe instrumented with a fast-response coaxial thermocouple flush-mounted at the stagnation point, while pitot pressure was measured with a hemispherical-nose probe. The experimental data were originally processed using simplified theoretical relations, such as the Sutton–Graves and Fay–Riddell stagnation heating formulas, to estimate the enthalpy distribution in the hypersonic freestream. In this study, three-dimensional CFD calculations with the open-source code OpenFOAM were employed to reproduce the experiments and reduce uncertainty in the estimated tunnel flow conditions. Best agreement with the measurements was obtained using a total enthalpy of 7.28 MJ/kg for the flat probe, which is about 8% lower than the value inferred from the first-order analysis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The molten fluoride salts used in Molten Salt Reactors are known for being a challenging environment for construction materials. Nickel alloys are usually used in this application for their corrosion and temperature resistance. The goal of this work was to test MoNiCr alloy in a molten mixture of lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride (FLiBe) and to evaluate the effect laser shock peening (LSP) and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) methods of thermomechanical treatment on its corrosion resistance. The material was first processed by LSP, then a HIP heat treatment followed. The aim is to create a modified surface layer through a combination of these processes. The corrosion test itself was performed by immersion of specimens in molten FLiBe at 700 °C for 1000 hours. The results showed that both LSP and HIP have observable influence on corrosion of MoNiCr alloy. Although the depth of corrosion damage did not differ greatly, the mechanism varied considerably. Regardless of the treatment method, all samples showed chromium depletion to a depth of approximately 30 µm. A zone of finer grains was formed in the same area. Material processed with LSP alone was more susceptible to intergranular corrosion, while the combination of LSP and HIP suppressed it. The number of passes and type of ablation layer in LSP process have a big role. The best results were achieved with LSP processing with a higher number of repeated passes (10) and without ablation polymer tape. In combination with HIP, intergranular corrosion was completely suppressed.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In internal combustion engines, access to calibrated physical models of engine subsystems is crucial for building predictive models of engine emissions. Specifically, understanding the temperature and pressure dynamics of the intake manifold (IM) can help characterize the behavior of the cylinder contents, which largely impact the performance. Rather than working with a complex and multidimensional model, we can employ a mean value model (MVM) to accurately capture the IM states. However, in situations where heat transfer affects cannot be ignored, the standard MVM contains unknown physical parameters representing various material properties. This also causes the dynamics to appear in a nonlinear way. When coupled with noisy measurement data, a Bayesian approach is often necessary to reconstruct both the IM states and physical parameters. One would typically apply a variant of the Kalman filter suitable for nonlinear dynamics such as particle filters. For real engine datasets this is computationally unfeasible, as there are often hundreds of thousands of data points sampled in a matter of minutes. In this work, we demonstrate how information field theory (IFT) can be applied to solve the IM filtering and calibration problem. IFT is a scientific machine learning framework for simultaneous Bayesian calibration of dynamic states and physical parameters. We demonstrate the method across different datasets with varying degrees of fidelity collected from real engines. By informing the IFT prior of the MVM, the model predictions remain robust even with limited data. Finally, the IFT posterior also quantifies the uncertainty about the IM material properties.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract A selective cell-based smoothed finite element method (CSFEM) is incorporated into a partitioned semi-implicit coupling scheme for fluid-structure interaction (FSI) based on four-node quadrilateral element. The selective CSFEM invokes full and reduced integrations at different steps of the characteristic-based split (CBS) scheme that solves the Navier-Stokes equations in a fractional-step manner. Because the semi-implicit coupling framework is also underpinned by the CBS scheme, an hourglass control is adopted to stabilize both the partitioned algorithm and selective CSFEM over under-integrated smoothing cells. The elastodynamics equations are computed via the conventional CSFEM. The developed technique is validated against available data for different FSI examples. In addition to satisfactory results, it can save more computer time than the original semi-implicit coupling algorithm using the standard CSFEM.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Fluconazole (FLC)-resistant Candidozyma auris isolates have reduced drug accumulation compared to azole-susceptible isolates. Of 119 C. auris isolates, 83 out of 87 resistant isolates (~95%) had extremely low fluconazole uptake, whereas 30 out of 32 susceptible isolates (~93%) had high fluconazole uptake. In search of a genetic explanation for this phenomenon, we compared metadata for TAC1B and CDR1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and found overlap with many but not all isolates that are FLC resistant. We found that CDR1 mutations are common in resistant isolates from Clade 1, and TAC1B mutations are commonly found in resistant isolates from clades 1 and 3. There is clearly an association between FLC resistance and certain CDR1 and TAC1B polymorphisms, but mutations in these genes do not account for all mechanisms of resistance in this species and do not account for the difference in FLC accumulation. However, when ERG11 SNPs were included in the analysis, there is a clear correlation between low FLC accumulation and isolates that have one of five ERG11 variants and also high FLC accumulation and isolates that have non-variant ERG11 sequences. The ERG11 mutations F126L, K143R, V125/F126L, Y132F, or Y501H are correlated to fluconazole resistance and reduced fluconazole accumulation. This is a unique characteristic of C. auris, suggesting mutations in ERG11 can cause changes in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and membrane composition, organization, and permeability. IMPORTANCE Candidozyma auris is a global human health threat because of its near-universal resistance to the antifungal fluconazole as well as a predisposition to multidrug resistance among clinical isolates. The underlying mechanisms of antifungal drug resistance in this species are still largely under investigation, and these efforts are significantly supported by research that increase our understanding of unique aspects of C. auris biology. We have identified a correlation between C. auris isolates’ susceptibility to fluconazole and intracellular drug accumulation in which drug-resistant isolates have significantly reduced intracellular fluconazole compared to isolates that are susceptible to fluconazole. We have proposed a mechanism for this phenomenon and demonstrated important roles for mutations in ERG11, TAC1B, and CDR1 gene sequences for drug resistance.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Multidrug resistance (MDR) of the pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii is a major challenge to global healthcare due to the limited treatment options. The emergence of MDR bacteria necessitates innovative therapeutic approaches, especially given the associated economic burden and the rapid spread of infections. Conventional treatments such as antibiotics and vaccines face significant obstacles. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as LL37 have potential as an alternative treatment due to their broad-spectrum activity and ability to target specific bacterial structures such as the outer membrane protein A (OmpA). The efficacy of AMPs can be enhanced by using nanobodies (Nbs) that bind to bacterial OmpA, guiding LL37 precisely to its target. In this study, A. baumannii OmpA (AbOmpA)-specific Nbs (NbO7 and NbO13) were efficiently isolated through magnetic-activated cell sorting-based screening of a yeast surface display library, eliminating the need for specialized equipment. Nbs exhibited specific, dose-dependent binding to the target. Conjugation of Nbs with LL37 effectively inhibited the growth of MDR A. baumannii . This approach leverages the natural antimicrobial properties of AMPs and enhances their specificity and effectiveness by targeting bacterial cell surface proteins. LL37-conjugated AbOmpA-Nbs present a promising therapeutic strategy against MDR A. baumannii and other resistant pathogens. IMPORTANCE Multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii poses a major global health threat due to its resistance to nearly all available antibiotics and its persistence in hospital settings. This challenge underscores the urgent need for new therapeutic approaches beyond conventional drugs. In this study, we developed an innovative strategy that combines the human antimicrobial peptide LL37 with nanobodies (Nbs) targeting the outer membrane protein A (OmpA), a key virulence and survival factor of A. baumannii . OmpA-specific Nbs were efficiently isolated from a fully synthetic library using a simple, low-cost selection approach without animal immunization. When conjugated with LL37, these Nbs bound specifically to OmpA and strongly inhibited MDR A. baumannii growth in vitro . Our findings introduce a simple yet powerful platform for generating targeted Nb-peptide conjugates, offering strong potential for adaptation against other antibiotic-resistant pathogens and contributing to the development of next-generation biologics to overcome antibiotic limitations.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Bifidobacterium adolescentis is one of the most frequently encountered bifidobacterial species present in the adult human gut microbiota, with a prevalence of approximately 60%. Despite its high prevalence, B. adolescentis has not been extensively studied and characterized, and our understanding of its physiological traits, genetic diversity, and potential interactions with other members of the human gut microbiota or with its host is therefore fragmentary. In the current study, a data set comprising 1,682 B. adolescentis genomes was compiled by combining publicly available data and metagenome assemblies from 131 projects to uncover the unique genetic characteristics of this species. A pangenome analysis of B. adolescentis identified 203 clusters of orthologous genes absent from the other five human-associated Bifidobacterium species, six of which were in silico predicted to encode functions unique to this taxon. Furthermore, 2,597 genes were predicted to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer, including genes encoding extracellular structures involved in interaction with the host and other microorganisms, and phage defense mechanisms against bacteriophages. Detailed phylogenetic analysis revealed seven clusters within the B. adolescentis species, each partially associated with the origin of strain isolation, suggesting phylogenetic differentiation shaped by geographical strain origin. Moreover, a large-scale metagenomic analysis of over 10,000 human gut metagenomes from healthy adults revealed that B. adolescentis co-occurs with 36 putative beneficial commensals and butyrate-producing taxa, highlighting its role as a key bifidobacterial species involved in microbial networking within the adult human gut microbiota. IMPORTANCE To comprehensively explore the biodiversity within a microbial species, the reconstruction of a substantial number of genomes is essential. In this study, we successfully uncovered the genetic diversity of Bifidobacterium adolescentis by retrieving a large number of genomes from human gut metagenomic samples. The complete overview of the B. adolescentis pangenome enabled us to investigate the genetic features that distinguish this gut commensal from other bifidobacterial species residing in the human intestinal microbiota.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis are the leading bacterial zoonoses in Europe, with poultry meat being the primary source of human contamination. Although both Campylobacter and Salmonella bacteria can coexist asymptomatically in chickens, their reciprocal impact remains underexplored. An in vitro study showed that Campylobacter jejuni survival was positively affected by the presence of Salmonella , but no data are available on this interaction in the animal gut. In this study, an in vivo investigation was carried out to explore the dynamics between Campylobacter and Salmonella colonization in chickens. The results revealed that both Salmonella and Campylobacter maintained significantly higher levels of colonization in the ceca throughout the experiment when co-inoculated compared to when inoculated alone. Additionally, changes in the microbiota were associated with each pathogen inoculated alone, but the simultaneous presence of Campylobacter and Salmonella induced specific modulations that could possibly explain this phenomenon. Significant differences were found in the serum metabolome of the contaminated groups, and partial least squares discriminant analysis models enabled the discrimination of contaminated animals from controls using these metabolic signals. Furthermore, possible links between variations in the microbiota and variations in the metabolome were identified. IMPORTANCE This study demonstrates a synergistic effect between Salmonella and Campylobacter jejuni in the gut during co-infection in chickens, leading to an increased presence of both pathogens, as well as unique microbiota and metabolome changes. These findings underscore the importance of considering co-infection in poultry control measures and highlight the complex interplay between pathogens, microbiota, and metabolism.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Marek’s disease, a highly contagious avian immunosuppressive disorder caused by the α-herpesvirus MDV-1, poses a significant threat to poultry health. The development of rapid visual detection methods capable of distinguishing epidemic MDV-1 strains from vaccine strains is crucial for early disease warning, vaccine efficacy evaluation, and precise disease control. We developed a novel isothermal detection system that integrates recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with CRISPR/Cas14a technology for the visual identification of epidemic MDV-1 strains. This method operates at a constant temperature of 37°C and allows for either real-time analysis or endpoint visual readout without the need for complex instrumentation. Our results showed no cross-reactivity with Newcastle disease virus, infectious bursal disease virus, MDV-1 vaccine strains, or herpesvirus of turkeys. Plasmid DNA standards were used to determine the sensitivity of the assay, and the detection limit was 24.6 copies/μL. Clinical evaluation using 24 field samples confirmed that the method successfully identified all Marek’s disease virus-positive cases, demonstrating its diagnostic reliability. In conclusion, we have developed a rapid, highly specific nucleic acid detection platform for MDV-1 that enables visual readout without complex instrumentation by combining the sensitivity of RPA with the specificity of CRISPR/Cas14a technology, offering promising potential for field-based diagnostics and disease surveillance. IMPORTANCE Marek’s disease virus (MDV-1) is a highly contagious and economically important avian pathogen. Existing diagnostic methods are unable to reliably distinguish between epidemic and vaccine strains in field settings, which hampers effective surveillance and evaluation of vaccination programs. To address this challenge, we developed a portable isothermal detection assay that combines recombinase polymerase amplification with CRISPR/Cas14a technology. This approach enables highly sensitive (24.6 copies/μL) and specific visual detection of epidemic MDV-1 strains without cross-reactivity with vaccine strains or related viruses. The assay demonstrated 100% agreement with reference methods when evaluated using clinical samples. As a cost-effective method that avoids the need for complex detection instruments, it offers a practical solution for rapid on-site diagnosis, facilitating enhanced outbreak control and improved poultry health management globally.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The coordinated post-natal development of the gut microbiome and metabolome is essential for preterm infant health, yet its disruption is increasingly linked to adverse outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In this study, we performed an integrated multiomics analysis of fecal samples collected from preterm infants to characterize temporal changes in gut microbial and metabolic profiles and explore their potential associations with BPD development. This study observed a distinct trajectory of the phylum Bacteroidota as a hallmark of normal gut maturation, with its abundance progressively declining across non-BPD infants. In contrast, infants who later developed BPD exhibited early depletion followed by irregular enrichment of Bacteroidota. Correlation analysis revealed that Streptococcus abundance was positively associated with elevated cysteic acid, a metabolite linked to oxidative stress. Together, these findings suggest that altered Bacteroidota succession and Streptococcus -associated oxidative imbalance may reflect early microbial-metabolic perturbations in infants at risk of BPD. This work provides preliminary, hypothesis-generating insights into gut-associated signatures potentially relevant to BPD pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) remains a leading cause of morbidity in preterm infants, yet early biomarkers and targeted preventive strategies are limited. By integrating microbiome and metabolome data from a pilot cohort, this study identified patterns of disrupted Bacteroidota succession and Streptococcus -associated oxidative stress that are associated with BPD risk. These findings highlight the gut as a potential extrapulmonary contributor to disease susceptibility and support early risk assessment and guide future microbiome-targeted interventions in preterm infants.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Saxifraga stolonifera Meeb is widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of infections. This study aims to evaluate the antibacterial properties and suppression of virulence by Saxifraga stolonifera Meeb extracts on Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Following extraction of Saxifraga stolonifera Meeb with petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, n-butyl alcohol, and water, the n-butyl alcohol extract had the strongest activity against P. aeruginosa PAO1 and P. aeruginosa ATCC27853, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of 10 and 5 mg/mL, respectively. In the presence of the n-butyl alcohol (n-BuOH) extract at 1/4MIC, genes lasI, lasR, rhlI, phzA1, phzA2, and pilG were decreased to levels ranging from 13% ( lasI ) to 43% ( phzA2 ). Both biofilm formation and pyocyanin production of PAO1 were inhibited by the n-BuOH extract at sub-inhibitory concentrations. N-butyl alcohol extract analyzed by HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS showed more than 11 compounds. Overall, our results suggest that the n-BuOH extract from Saxifraga stolonifera Meeb may be used as a new anti-virulence agent for P. aeruginosa infection. IMPORTANCE Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections pose severe challenges to clinical treatment, and anti-virulence therapy has emerged as a novel therapeutic strategy. This study demonstrates that the n-butanol extract of Saxifraga stolonifera exerts anti-virulence effects by downregulating virulence-related genes, inhibiting quorum-sensing systems, and biofilm formation. Moreover, its multiple bioactive components also possess antibacterial and anti-virulence properties. S. stolonifera is thus promising to be developed into a novel anti-virulence inhibitor against P. aeruginosa for the prevention and treatment of clinically relevant infections.",

    "Abstract": "Brain computer interface (BCI) technology supports the interactions of individuals with severe neuromuscular limitations with their environment. This work presents a classification approach for distinguishing motor imagery (MI) from speech-related cognitive imagery (CI), such as word generation and arithmetic subtraction, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. Differentiating MI and CI/SI processes is relevant for expanding command diversity in hybrid BCI systems and for clarifying the distinct neural mechanisms underlying motor versus verbal–semantic processing. Although a large proportion of non-invasive BCI studies focus on MI, this distinction has received relatively limited attention, particularly in magnetoencephalography (MEG)-based approaches. Making this distinction is important for increasing command diversity in hybrid BCI systems and for improving the understanding of neural mechanisms associated with motor and verbal–semantic processing. Tasks from an open-access MEG dataset were analyzed across six binary pairs (H-F, H-W, H-S, F-W, F-S, W-S). MEG signals were processed using two frequency-separation strategies: a broad-band configuration (FSB-1: 8–14 Hz and 14-30 Hz) and a narrow-band configuration (FSB-2: six sub-bands between 8-32 Hz). Time–frequency features were extracted using continuous wavelet transform (CWT), and spatial features via the common spatial pattern (CSP) method. Feature selection followed a two-stage procedure: (i) t-test ranking to obtain a shared feature set for all task pairs; and (ii) subject- and task-specific optimization of feature number. The initial evaluation based on the shared feature set showed that the FSB-2/CWT approach yielded better classification accuracies compared to FSB-1/CWT (H-F: 56%, H-W: 71%, H-S: 66% vs. 54%, 68%, 64%). With subject- and task-adaptive optimization, additional improvements were observed. Accuracies increased to 60%, 72%, and 69% for FSB-1, and to 63%, 75%, and 71% for FSB-2, for H-F, H-W, and H-S, respectively. Overall, the findings indicate that the proposed CWT+CSP framework, particularly when combined with adaptive feature optimization, offers an interpretable analysis approach that can contribute to MI–CI discrimination in MEGbased BCI systems under limited data conditions.",

    "Abstract": "In the context of globalization, variations in carbon emission intensity and economic growth rates exhibit not only direct, reciprocal effects within individual countries but also indirect transmission mechanisms across regions and nations. Employing the Global Vector Autoregressive (GVAR) model and utilizing quarterly data from 33 countries—including 8 Eurozone members—spanning from the first quarter of 1990 to the fourth quarter of 2019, this paper demonstrates that major global economies continue to exhibit salient features of low-carbon economic development. Specifically, reductions in carbon emission intensity in developed countries frequently exert adverse spillover effects on the economic growth rates of other nations. In response to negative economic shocks, numerous countries increase their carbon emission intensity as a countercyclical measure, while others reduce emissions—potentially reflecting that they have surpassed the turning point posited by the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). These findings highlight that advancing low-carbon economic development requires sustained improvements in production technologies and energy efficiency, alongside strengthened international cooperation in carbon emissions management, in order to alleviate the additional costs arising from the asynchronous progression of global carbon reduction efforts.",

Each job is subject to two possible processing-time scenarios. The problem requires simultaneously choosing the machine’s location and a job schedule so that the resulting completion times across both scenarios are Pareto-optimal. To this end, we introduce the concept of ordered regions, defined as subsets of the graph in which the order of job release dates remains invariant. We establish that within each region, the set of feasible non-dominated solutions reduces to either a singleton or a continuous interval. Building on the piecewise-linear structure of the objectives, we propose an exact algorithm that constructs and systematically prunes candidate solutions, thereby obtaining the complete Pareto front in the objective space. The proposed algorithm runs in polynomial time on general graphs, and our computational experiments indicate an empirical running-time behavior close to [Formula: see text].",

For training, we generate many data sets composed of holographic entanglement entropy and corresponding metric solutions. After training these data, the transformer model predicts the dual geometry from arbitrary test sets of entanglement entropy data. The reconstruction of the dual gravity allows us to get more information on the thermodynamic quantities of thermal systems, which cannot be read directly from entanglement entropy data.

    "Abstract": "This letter, as a sequel of the previous work [Found. Chem. 26, 301–314 (2024)], presents a bibliometric analysis of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (acronym as HR diagram or sometimes simply HRD) which portrays an analog to the periodic table of the elements in the macroscopic system. A fundamental technique for studying stellar evolution and populations, the HRD essentially plots the luminosity or absolute magnitude of stars against their effective temperature or spectral type, revealing the physical properties and evolutionary stages of stars. We employ here bibliometric analysis which has been originated as a vital scientific tool, providing inestimable perception into the publication output of authors, institutions, nations etc. and thus qualifies the researchers to recognize the trends, map research areas and trail the impact of research publications. Exploiting Scopus databases, we have analyzed the scientific production, publication trends, most relevant authors and countries and keywords, author’s impact and research themes of articles related to the HRD. We present a thorough and methodical review of the HRD research field for the period 1991 to 2023 to display how it has evolved.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, drawing upon quantum state masking theory, we first propose a method that utilizes d-dimensional orthogonal arrays to encode quantum states into a multi-party quantum system. Building upon this foundation, we then design a quantum secret sharing scheme whose security is rooted in the principles of quantum information masking. This scheme is designed based on the hyperstar structure to define the access structure. Additionally, the protocol enables the transmission of arbitrary d-dimensional quantum states through quantum channels constructed using orthogonal arrays, ensuring that only participants within the access structure can recover the secret. We have thoroughly analyzed the security of this scheme against major quantum attacks, including intercept-resend attacks, entangle-measure attacks, and dishonest participant attack. In conclusion, our analysis examines the impact of four common types of noise on this protocol, confirming its immunity to dit-flip noise. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of the proposed scheme against existing quantum secret sharing protocols, highlighting its respective advantages.",

    "Abstract": "This study used the constant statistical tensor (CST) method to calculate mixing ratios (δ) for high-spin excited states in 182 Pt nuclide in the following heavy ion reactions: 170 Yb ( 16 O,4n) 182 Pt, 162 Dy ( 24 Mg,4n) 182 Pt and 163 Dy ( 24 Mg,5n) 182 Pt. To determine the multipole mixing ratios (δ) for all γ-transitions in the 182 Pt nuclide, the statistical tensor ρ2 (J i ) must be calculated for pure transitions or transitions considered to be pure. These ρ2 (J i ) values are considered constant for all levels with the same (Ji), and can thus be used to calculate the multipole mixing ratios of γ-transitions for both pure and mixed transitions. The obtained multipole mixing ratios show that most values calculated for pure transitions are very small, confirming that these transitions represent the pure electrical transition (E1) or (E2). However, the multipole mixing ratios calculated for the mixed transition were not the same as those obtained experimentally. Although the angular distributions for some γ-transitions had previously been experimentally obtained, their δ-values had not been previously calculated for all γ-transitions. The δ-values of these γ-transitions have been calculated in this work. The results for the mixing ratios values for γ-transitions in this study confirm the possibility of using the CST method as a tool for the calculation of the δ-values when it cannot be obtained experimentally.",

    "Abstract": "There should be quantum vacuum uctuations of gravitational fields if gravitation is quantized. Consequently in analogy to the electromagnetic Casimir-Polder force, one also expects the quantum gravitational interaction generated between a gravitationally polarizable object and a gravitational boundary. In this paper, we study this interaction between a static object and an infinite gravitational Neumann boundary, by a generalization of the DDC (Dalibard, Dupont-Roc and Cohen-Tannoudji) formalism. We find that, when the object-to-boundary distance L is very small compared to the characteristic transition wavelength of the object, the contribution of the radiation reaction of the object dominates over that of vacuum gravitational uctuations, and it corresponds to an attractive interaction force scaling as L -6 , regardless of different polarizations of the object. But quantitatively, the magnitudes of the force are obviously affected, and when the mass of the object is distributed along the vertical-to-boundary axis the magnitude is slightly larger. For extremely large L, the interaction force, as a result of the retardation effect, behaves characteristically one-order higher than the near-region force. Remarkably, although the total interaction force is also attractive, the contribution of the radiation reaction can be either attractive or repulsive, depending on the exact values of L, and in contrast to the near-region case, this contribution can be potentially smaller than the vacuum-uctuation contribution.",

    "Abstract": "We present a comprehensive analytical study of a four-dimensional dilaton black hole with a deformed angular geometry r 2 R(r) 2 , where R(r) = (r/r 0 ) N , coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics and a Liouville-type potential. The model generalizes standard black hole solutions by incorporating a geometric deformation that modifies the horizon structure and thermodynamic behavior. We derive the field equations and compute the Hawking temperature, classical entropy, and quantum-corrected entropy S = S 0 + cln S 0 without resorting to numerical methods. The logarithmic correction coefficient c is explicitly evaluated for generic N and special cases N = −1/2, −3/4, revealing its sensitivity to the dilaton coupling α, charge q, and geometric parameter N. We analyze the limits q → 0 and Λ → 0, showing that quantum corrections persist even in the absence of electromagnetic or cosmological terms, indicating their origin in the modified geometry. Crucially, we demonstrate that in the limit N → 0, α → 0, γ → 0, the solution reduces exactly to the Reissner-Nordström-AdS black hole, with all thermodynamic quantities recovering their standard forms. This confirms the model as a consistent deformation of classical black holes. The results highlight the significant role of geometric and scalar deformations in shaping black hole thermodynamics and quantum properties.",

    "Abstract": "This work develops two novel singularity-free solutions in the framework of f(T,𝕋) gravity which describe anisotropic spherically symmetric matter configurations. By incorporating the effects of anisotropic fluid within a static interior metric, we derive the modified Einsteinfield equations under a particular gravity model. Two special restrictions that make system easy to solve are then applied to the field equations, leading to a couple of distinct solutions. The study involves solving differential equations and the resulting expressions contain integration constants which are identified by enforcing boundary conditions between the interior metric and the exterior Schwarzschild spacetime. Another crucial restriction is the vanishing radial pressure requirement at the surface of a star. Afterwards, we analyze the necessary conditions that must be fulfilled for theoretical models to manifest as physically viable systems. We employ observational data from three known compact stars Cen X-3, SMC X-4, and LMC X-4 to graphically evaluate our theoretical solutions. Our investigation confirms that both stellar solutions satisfy the physical existence criteria for specific model parametric choices.",

The study demonstrates the viability of gravastars as alternatives to black holes (BHs) in this massive gravity. Our research yields singularity free analytical solutions for gravastar interior and without event horizon. Our discussion focuses on the properties of the thin shell of ultra-relativistic stiff fluid viz., length, energy, entropy and the massive gravity’s impact on these physical properties. The junction conditions have been carefully examined and study of surface redshift analysis implies regularity of the model. Our investigation also includes energy condition analysis supporting the thin shell formation. Thus our solutions eliminate singularities and information paradoxes and the implications of these solutions are seemingly noteworthy and exhibit physical desirable properties.",

Starting with a modified spherically symmetric black hole solution, we derived and analyzed the spin-dependent Regge-Wheeler potentials for scalar, vector, and tensor perturbations, uncovering significant deviations from the Schwarzschild black hole due to the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter. Our findings revealed that the parameter strongly influences the stability of the black hole and the propagation of perturbative modes. Additionally, we calculated GFs to investigate the transmission coefficients of black hole radiation and demonstrated their dependence on both the spin of the fields and the symmetry-breaking effects. Thermodynamic analyses showed modifications to the temperature, entropy, and specific heat, which highlighted the critical role of Lorentz symmetry-breaking effects on black hole stability. Furthermore, we discussed the area quantization of the black hole horizon, revealing its direct dependence on the symmetry-breaking parameter and providing insights into the quantum nature of black holes. These results collectively enrich our understanding of black hole physics under modified gravity theories and offer potential observational implications.",

By fixing the horizon radius, we analyze the dependence of the parameters of the black holes and the parameter of PFDM. The computed quasi-normal modes confirm the dynamical stability of the black holes under scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Furthermore, both the real and imaginary parts of the quasi-normal modes increase with the multipole number l, corresponding to higher oscillation frequencies and faster damping rates. On the other hand, absorption cross sections are compared under similar parametric conditions. The results demonstrate that PFDM inuences the dynamical properties of regular black holes.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this manuscript is to examine new soliton solutions for the (3+1)-dimensional extended Jimbo-Miwa model with nonlinear properties. The model represents a wide range of scientific processes in domains such as mathematical biology, nonlinear optics, and quantum field theory, which include complex wave interactions. To begin, we employ the homogeneous balance method to create the original Auto-Bäcklund and Cole-Hopf transformations for the given model, leading to the derivation of various soliton-like solutions that exhibit hyperbolic, trigonometric, and exponential wave functions. After that, a Bäcklund transformation is generated, which has an equal number of arbitrary parameters and bilinear equations. Then, this formation is used to generate two categories of exponential and rational traveling wave solutions with arbitrary wave numbers, resulting in numerous soliton-like solutions. This study also constructs new complexiton solutions using the extended transform rational function method combined with the Hirota bilinear form. To provide further insight into the physical aspects of these solutions, we depict them through a range of visual methods, including 3-D, 2-D, and density plots. The results of this research are innovative and contribute significantly to the ongoing investigation of the equation, providing useful guidance for researchers in future studies. Also, the obtained exact solutions and their physical interpretations are expected to attract considerable interest in the study of nonlinear evolution equations, integrable models, and soliton theory within theoretical physics.",

    "Abstract": "Low-energy Deuterium–Deuterium fusion in condensed matter remains a sensitive probe of electronic screening. We present an analytic framework for finite-length metallic wire meshes, outlining how wire radius, lattice spacing, and length can influence the collective electronic response. Within our model, finite-length confinement can logarithmically enhance an effective (Drude-like) electronic inertia, shorten the Thomas–Fermi screening length, and increase the static screening energy while preserving a transparent separation between static and dynamic dielectric regimes. We formulate four complementary static closures—(M1) classical Thomas–Fermi, (M2) D-ion fast response, (M3) momentum-integrated TF, and (M4) Lindhard with a constant local-field factor—and combine them with bound-electron background permittivity, image-charge, and cohesive (lattice) corrections in a way that aims to reduce double counting. For fabrication-realistic geometries and standard metals (Cu, Ag, Au, Pd), the model indicates that 1–2.5 keV screening energies are possible within selected parameter ranges, with geometry acting as the primary driver; copper tends to yield comparatively larger values in this framework, whereas palladium offers practical advantages for deuterium uptake and thermal stability. The corresponding increase in sub-Coulomb D+D fusion cross sections may reach multiple orders of magnitude, owing to the exponential tunneling dependence, suggesting that electronic screening can, at least within this model, be approached as an potentially engineerable design parameter for compact fusion studies. While the present analysis is fully analytic, its predictions are intended as testable upper bounds rather than definitive values.",

    "Abstract": "This research addresses the pure-cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation augmented by thirdorder dispersion, characterized by quadratic–cubic nonlinearities and explicitly excluding the group-velocity dispersion term. Such an equation is well suited for representing the behavior of ultrashort optical pulses in nonlinear fibers, in which higher-order effects strongly influence the dynamics. By applying the new Kudryashov method and the Jacobi elliptic function method, we systematically derive a wide family of soliton solutions, including bright solitons, W-shaped solitons, and kink solitons, each exhibiting distinct amplitude profiles and propagation characteristics. The role of essential system parameters, including quadratic and cubic nonlinear coefficients along with third-order dispersion strength, is systematically explored, revealing the physical conditions under which these nonlinear waveforms emerge. The results highlight the rich diversity of soliton structures possible in this system and underscore the potential applications in the control of high-speed optical pulses. In the absence of the group-velocity dispersion term, this version of the equation has not been previously explored; here, we present the first modulation instability analysis, incorporating the effects of quadratic and cubic nonlinearities, with results expected to offer valuable input to the field.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we solve the Einstein equation for an uncharged black hole by considering the energymomentum tensor and the energy-momentum pseudotensor to first order in the gravitational constant of 3+1 dimensions. The ground state of the black hole field is a spherical wave in 3+1 dimensions. Furthermore, by solving the equation, we see that the black hole vibrates and rotates spatially, since the spatial solutions of the equation are Bessel functions of order equal to an integer plus one-half. This could be an explanation of why a black hole emits radiation known as Hawking radiation. Classical and quantum treatments of the equations yield identical results under Gupta-Bleuler quantization formalism.",

    "Abstract": "The dynamics of trade-off relations between quantum information resources are investigated in a system of two non-interacting qubits, each individually and nonlinearly coupled to coherent cavity fields through intensity-dependent coupling. The qubits are initially prepared in a maximally entangled Bell state, while the cavity fields are assumed to be in coherent states. An exact analytical treatment of the reduced two-qubit density matrix is presented under qubit–cavity detuning and intrinsic decoherence governed by the Milburn model. The time evolutions of first-order coherence, concurrence, intrinsic concurrence, and purity are analysed to elucidate the redistribution of quantum resources. The results confirm that intrinsic concurrence and first-order coherence obey a complementary trade-off relation governed by the purity of the two-qubit state, with standard concurrence acting as a lower bound for intrinsic concurrence throughout the dynamics. The roles of the initial coherent field intensity, qubit–cavity detuning, and intrinsic decoherence are examined, showing that nonlinear atom–cavity interactions induce regular oscillatory behaviour accompanied by entanglement sudden death and revival phenomena. Increasing the coherent field intensity enhances coherence generation and accelerates entanglement degradation of the generated two-qubit states.",

    "Abstract": "We establish a rigorous correspondence between the Krein space regularization method and the Lagrange multiplier (LM) approach to quantum gravity, extending both to the full Einstein-Hilbert action within the Unified Standard Model with Emergent Gravity-Effective Field Theory (USMEG-EFT) framework. Through explicit calculation of the one-loop effective action using the heat kernel expansion in the LM framework and the modified propagator structure in Krein quantization, we demonstrate that both methods yield identical finite results. The one-loop effective action takes the form [Formula: see text], with coefficients derived from the Seeley-DeWitt heat kernel expansion. The parameter correspondence [Formula: see text] emerges naturally from the regularization structure, with both encoding the finite domain of validity characteristic of an effective field theory. We demonstrate that both methods independently restrict quantum gravitational corrections to one-loop order through structurally isomorphic cancellation mechanisms: opposite-sign propagators in the LM formalism correspond to negative-norm states in Krein space, with higher-loop contributions vanishing identically via binomial summation. We provide detailed analysis of why standard Hilbert space quantization fails due to positive-definiteness constraints, and how the indefinite metric structure of Krein spaces enables systematic divergence cancellation while preserving unitarity in the physical sector. This equivalence provides mutual theoretical support for the USMEG-EFT framework representing the first successful unification of quantum gravity with the Standard Model.",

    "Abstract": "We present a novel application of Bateman-type dissipation to relativistic scalar fields in cosmology, focusing on tachyonic and Born–Infeld (DBI) frameworks. By embedding a dual-field structure directly at the Lagrangian level with an exponential time-dependent factor, we introduce intrinsic dissipative dynamics that dynamically modify the effective mass of the field. Remarkably, this mechanism can quench tachyonic instabilities, leading to a positive effective mass related to the Hubble expansion rate, thereby stabilizing the field without introducing external friction or environmental couplings. We explore the implications of this framework for early-universe dynamics, including inflationary behavior, gravitational collapse, and gauge field back-reaction in nonlinear BI/DBI cosmologies. Furthermore, the approach suggests potential relevance for late-time cosmic acceleration and dark energy models, providing a dynamical route to slow or regulate expansion. The study also opens conceptual connections with fractional calculus and nonlocal dissipation, offering a pathway to generalized scalar-field dynamics in cosmology. Overall, our results highlight a unified and original perspective on dissipation in field theory, with broad implications for both early- and late-universe physics",

Motivated by this correspondence, we introduce a retarded propagator whose spectral weight is given by the ξ-function and analyze it within the framework of Krein space quantization, where sign-indefinite spectral measures are admissible. This construction yields a geometric and spectral interpretation of the ξ-function restricted to the critical line and relates the asymptotic spacing of its zeros to a mass–time scaling in de Sitter geometry.

    "Abstract": "This work addresses the critical challenge of obtaining exact solutions for the β-fractional dual-mode nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE). Understanding this model is fundamentally important as it governs wave propagation in complex media exhibiting simultaneous nonlinearity, dispersion, and fractional order effects, with direct applications in nonlinear optics and quantum physics. To tackle this problem, we employ the powerful and systematic modified extended mapping method (MEMM). Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive modulation instability analysis to rigorously assess the dynamical stability of the governing model. Our investigation yields a novel and distinct family of exact solutions. Key results include the derivation of bright, dark, singular, and combined bright-dark soliton solutions, alongside a spectrum of other wave patterns such as Jacobi elliptic, hyperbolic, and periodic functions. Graphical analysis reveals the profound and controllable influence of the fractional-order derivative (β) on the amplitude, width, and propagation dynamics of these waves. The stability analysis confirms the robustness of the model under small perturbations. We conclusively demonstrate that the β-fractional dualmode NLSE supports a wide variety of stable, exact wave solutions. The fractional parameter β acts as a crucial tuning knob for wave modulation. These validated solutions provide a reliable theoretical foundation for predicting and engineering wave behaviors in fractional physical systems. The novelty of this work lies in the first successful application of the MEMM to the β-fractional dual-mode NLSE, revealing previously unreported solution classes. It significantly extends the literature by moving beyond standard solitons to uncover combined structures and fractional-dependent dynamics, thereby offering deeper analytical insight and enhanced control over nonlinear wave phenomena for advanced technological applications.",

Furthermore, when the maximal proper force is set to be equal to the Planck-mass squared [Formula: see text] then [Formula: see text] happens to coincide with the numerical value of the horizon radius of the Schwarzschild black hole in four spacetime dimensions.

The upshot of this analysis reveals that these strings can naturally acquire a [Formula: see text] tension which is consistent with the dynamical tension model of strings and branes proposed by Guendelman in the past years [11].

We employ a kinematic parametrization to solve the field equations and constrain the model’s free parameters - specifically the Hubble constant [Formula: see text] and the expansion index [Formula: see text] - using Bayesian inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. Our analysis incorporates multiple observational datasets, including 57 OHD points, 1048 Pantheon SNIa events, and 6 BAO measurements.

    "Abstract": "We present an alternative framework to establish the neutrino mass scale from the Higgs mechanism in a minimalist approach, which does not introduce new scalar bosons or extend the symmetry group of the standard model (SM). A nonstandard form of the Higgs Lagrangian, constructed via the inverse problem of calculus of variations, is proposed. Only one dimensionful parameter in the TeV scale is incorporated into the SM Lagrangian. The multiplicative Lagrangian model of the Higgs field plays an essential role in explaining the vast mass difference between charged fermions and Dirac neutrinos, while the Yukawa couplings for these two groups of particles naturally fall within the same scale. On the other hand, if the neutrino mass term has both Dirac and Majorana components, the mass of the mostly right-handed neutrinos in the Type-I seesaw mechanism can range from the keV scale up to slightly below the grand unification scale without requiring extremely small Yukawa couplings outside the SM regime. Furthermore, we discuss the potential of this mechanism to explain the hierarchical structure in the Yukawa couplings between firstand third-generation particles.",

Thermodynamic indicators, including total energy, heat capacity, volume variation and Lindemann indices, were employed to characterize atomic vibrational stability and melting behavior. Radial distribution functions and the evolution of face-centered cubic () motifs reveal a pronounced nonlinear structural response to temperature, particularly near the melting transition. The results show that melting temperatures increase nonlinearly with Ni concentration, deviating from simple linear interpolation between pure components, with Ni-rich alloys preserving crystalline order over a wider temperature range. This enhanced thermal stability is attributed to stronger Ni–Ni bonding, consistent with the higher melting temperature of Ni. Structural analysis further confirms that Ni-rich alloys resist disordering more effectively. Complementary DFT calculations reveal that increasing Ni concentration redistributes the electronic states near the Fermi level, indicating composition-dependent electronic and magnetic responses. Overall, the combined MD–DFT analysis highlights the nonlinear coupling between composition, structure and electronic behavior in Cu–Ni alloys.",

This paper adopts a method that combines transfer learning (TL) and multi-task learning (MTL) to solve this problem. First, by using the pre-trained ResNet-50 model, the knowledge of the source domain is transferred to the target domain; the convolution layer is frozen; the fully connected layer is fine-tuned, thereby reducing the dependence on the labeled data in the target domain. Then, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) is utilized to extract the time series features of rail transit trains, and combined with multiple layers of convolution and pooling layers, the time domain and frequency domain features of the sensor signals are recorded. The MTL framework shares the feature extraction layer, and independent tasks are classified through a dedicated output layer. Multiple fault diagnosis tasks are jointly trained to enhance the model’s diagnostic ability for different types of faults. Experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed model in the diagnosis of power system fault, brake system fault, sensor fault, signal distortion fault, and noise interference fault is 92.5%, 91.3%, 94.1%, 89.7%, and 88.4%, respectively.

This paper proposes an observation-enhanced reinforcement learning with reward constraints algorithm (ORLRCA) to enhance AGV safety and energy efficiency obstacle avoiance in complex scenarios. In our work, firstly, a multimodal perceptual attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically capture obstacle motion patterns and environmental semantic features, thereby enhancing scene perception capabilities. Secondly, a multi-scale prior reward-constrained function is designed to jointly optimize safety distance, path smoothness, and energy consumption metrics, effectively addressing the suboptimal convergence caused by conflicting objectives in RL strategies. Finally, leveraging the actor-critic network architecture of proximal policy optimization (PPO), we achieve end-to-end optimization of robust obstacle avoidance policy generation through synergistic integration of attention-enhanced state representations and multi-scale reward signals. To validate efficacy, a high-fidelity simulation environment is developed for comparative experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits superior performance in obstacle avoidance success rate and energy efficiency compared to baseline RL methods, establishing a theoretical foundation for secure deployment and energy-efficient management of AGVs in practical industrial scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Despite being widely used to lower the cost of image storage and transmission, JPEG compression introduces unwanted artifacts like ringing, blurring, and blocking, especially at high compression ratios. These artifacts seriously impair visual perception and make it more difficult to perform later image analysis tasks like enhancement and recognition. The research aim is to reduce computational complexity while effectively recovering high-quality images from JPEG-compressed inputs. This is done by incorporating discrete cosine transform (DCT) priors by a pixel position labeling map and quantization table into a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN). The network applies a recursive pixel-shuffling mechanism to extend the receptive field and enhance feature learning with a three-level connection (residual) structure incorporating both global, local, and intermediate residuals. Tests on benchmark images (LIVE1, Classic5, and DIV2K) demonstrate that the model is more effective than the conventional methods of removing artifacts in JPEG against the background of computational efficiency, which are measured in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and perceptual quality of the proposed model.",

    "Abstract": "Efficient similarity search over high-dimensional embeddings is a core requirement of modern AI systems, yet most evaluations of Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) methods overlook the system-level dynamics that govern real-world performance. This study presents a comprehensive benchmark of six widely used ANNS algorithms—FLAT, IVF FLAT, IVF SQ8, HNSW, DiskANN, and ScaNN—integrated into Milvus and evaluated across both standalone and distributed (k3s-based) deployments. To capture modality-dependent behavior, the analysis spans two medium-size datasets, each consisting of 1.6 million embeddings: a large Turkish text corpus and a visual dataset generated using a unified 768-dimensional representation space. Each algorithm is assessed using recall@10, latency, throughput, and tail-latency (tp50-tp99), alongside detailed profiling of CPU utilization, RAM consumption, and disk I/O during indexing and querying. The results reveal distinct operational signatures: ScaNN and IVF SQ8 achieve the highest throughput—particularly for image embeddings; HNSW offers superior recall but imposes greater memory pressure; and DiskANN provides stable, memory-efficient performance with a bounded recall ceiling for text. Distributed experiments further show that graph-based indexes benefit from multi-node parallelism, while disk-aware methods maintain consistent performance. Overall, the findings demonstrate that ANNS selection requires a holistic evaluation that accounts for both retrieval quality and system-level resource behavior under realistic workloads.",

    "Abstract": "The flexible job shop scheduling problem with automated guided vehicles (FJSP–AGV) couples production and transport decisions, making scheduling and energy management computationally challenging. Conventional genetic algorithms apply a single decoder throughout the search and thus cannot adapt when instance characteristics or battery constraints change. We propose a portfolio–island decoding genetic algorithm (PID-NSGA-II) that shifts the focus from modifying evolutionary operators to learning which decoding strategies work best. Five heterogeneous decoders run in parallel on separate islands, and an upper-confidence-bound multi-armed bandit measures each island’s contribution to makespan improvement and adaptively reallocates population resources, automatically balancing exploration and exploitation. The framework is tested under two settings—pure makespan minimization and energy-aware scheduling with AGV battery considerations. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that PID-NSGA-II consistently improves solution quality and stability compared with single-decoder genetic algorithms, with greater gains when energy constraints are present. Adaptive learning of decoders delivers more robust scheduling decisions for complex FJSP-AGV environments and provides a scalable platform for smart manufacturing applications, achieving up to 25 % makespan reduction and substantial improvements in AGV battery levels across small, medium and large problem instances.",

We prove a new upper bound on the skein tree depth of a link and give examples of links where the new bound is stronger than the known bound; we also give a lower bound. Moreover, we derive tables of knots and links with their skein tree depth that were up to now undetermined (for some of them, we provide a range of possible values).

In this invited paper, we examine monthly demand forecasting for used aircraft parts in the nonintermittent domain (Smooth and Erratic), with CatBoost as the forecasting model. Our dataset contains more than 1,000 part-by-month demand records from January 2022 to June 2024, and we measure forecast accuracy using Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The best CatBoost model is a two-feature configuration that uses dispersion, expressed as Coefficient of Variation Squared (CV 2 ), and a sine encoding of the month of year, expressed as Month Sin. Against classical Croston-family baselines (Croston, SBA, and TSB), the CatBoost model reduces MAE by about 14%. From an operations standpoint, smaller under- and over-forecast errors support leaner safety stock levels, fewer rush shipments, and lower Aircraft on Ground (AOG) exposure.",

    "Abstract": "Wind-induced fluid-structure interaction (FSI) in membrane structures can lead to aeroelastic instability, yet experimental studies on closed saddle-shaped configurations remain limited. In this paper, the FSI mechanism of saddle-shaped closed membrane structure was deeply explored through wind tunnel tests. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was employed to visualize the flow characteristics, and proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) was applied to decompose the flow field and identify the dominant flow structures. Simultaneously, the aeroelastic response characteristics of the membrane structure were analyzed in both the time and frequency domains. The results show that as Reynolds number increases, the distance between the shear layer and the membrane surface decreases from 58 mm to 46 mm, while the vortex scale diminishes from 36 mm to 9 mm. This trends significantly increases the vortex shedding frequency, which in turn intensifies the FSI effects. Consequently, the structural vibration frequencies shift upward (e.g., 5.40 Hz to 27.92 Hz in 1 st -order frequency) and the aerodynamic damping ratio declines toward zero, indicating heightened instability risk. Concurrently, the aerodynamic damping ratio progressively declines, approaching zero values. The study reveals a distinct FSI mechanism for enclosed membranes, where the trapped air cavity and strong shear–surface interaction may lead to non-proportional damping and complex modal responses, providing new insights for the design of such flexible systems.",

Rectangular plate is assumed to be made from the porosity-dependent nanocomposite foam sandwiched by piezoelectric actuator/sensor layers. The influence of feedback Gain is also taken into consideration. Plate’s aluminum core consists of six nanocompsite foam layers having different values of porosities. The porous composite core is also assumed to be strengthened with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). Various kinds of edge conditions are given for the smart sandwich plate subjected to the linearly distributed compressive loading. The nonlinear equilibrium equations of the smart sandwich plate are calculated using the virtual work principle. The Reissner-Mindlin plate model in the framework of the von-Kármán geometric nonlinearity is also included into formulation. The stability equations are also determined by applying the adjacent equilibrium criterion. The system of coupled differential equations is solved for various kinds of boundary conditions by utilizing the Galerkin technique. The obtained results are compared with the existing data in the literature and a good agreement is observed. Several numerical examples are produced and presented to explore the effects of important factors such as material and geometrical parameters on the thermo-electro-mechanical buckling resistance in the smart sandwich plates.",

Inspired by the overlapping and rotational deformation mechanisms of fish scales, the structure exhibits pronounced negative Poisson’s ratio behavior, high stiffness, and enhanced energy absorption under compressive loading. Specimens were fabricated using Digital Light Processing (DLP) and investigated through quasi-static compression experiments and validated Abaqus finite element simulations. A parametric study was conducted to evaluate the influence of unit-cell curvature radius and thickness on the mechanical response, including stiffness, buckling behavior, Poisson’s ratio, and energy absorption capacity. The numerical model showed excellent agreement with experimental results, with deviations below 5% in load–displacement response and buckling force. Results indicate that increasing the curvature radius enhances stiffness and buckling resistance by up to 6% while reducing Poisson’s ratio by nearly 50%. In contrast, increasing the unit-cell thickness by only 0.2 mm leads to a substantial improvement in mechanical performance, raising the buckling force by approximately 70% and stiffness by about 45%, identifying thickness as the dominant design parameter. The combination of strong auxetic behavior, tunable stiffness, and high energy dissipation highlights the proposed metamaterial as a promising candidate for protective components such as blow hammer systems requiring controlled load transfer and mechanical durability.",

    "Abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive dynamic analysis of dual-bonded sandwich beams featuring micro-voided cores and nanoengineered CNT-gradated composite faces. The proposed structure departs from conventional sandwich concepts by integrating a quasi-brittle lightweight core whose stiffness and density are modified by uniformly distributed micro-voids with functionally tailored nanoscale reinforcement in the facesheets. The beam is supported by three discrete rows of linear elastic springs to model partial or elastic foundations typically encountered in civil, aerospace, and marine applications. The formulation accounts for the coupled effects of nanoscale gradation, core micro-porosity, and interfacial bonding stiffness, providing a unified framework for vibration tailoring of multilayer composite structures. Five CNT distribution profiles and three volume fractions are examined to reveal how the synergy between material gradation and micro-void effects influences the modal response. Numerical results show that increasing the void index from 0.0 to 0.8 increases the first three natural frequencies by 20–23 percent due to mass reduction dominance, while enhancing the CNT volume fraction from 0.12 to 0.28 yields up to 30 percent higher frequencies owing to nanoscale stiffening. The findings introduce a new perspective for designing lightweight and high-stiffness sandwich systems where vibration control and structural integrity are critical, particularly in smart bridges, modular frames, offshore platforms, and blast-resistant panels.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the nonlinear buckling response of functionally graded shallow circular nano-arches within the framework of the stress-driven nonlocal elasticity theory and Euler–Bernoulli beam kinematics. Geometric nonlinearity is incorporated through von Kármán strain–displacement relations, and the governing equations are discretized using the generalized differential quadrature method (GDQM). A possible equilibrium path, including the post-buckling regime, is traced via the arc-length method to capture potential instability phenomena. A parametric investigation is conducted to explore the influence of boundary conditions, geometric characteristics, nonlocal material length scale, gradation profile, and the extent of a partially applied transverse load on the buckling behavior. The results reveal that shallow nano-arches may exhibit multiple instability patterns, snap-back, and looping—depending on the combined effects of small-scale parameters, material gradation, loading characteristics and boundary conditions (BCs). To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the post-buckling behavior of functionally graded shallow nano-arches subjected to non-uniform partial loading using the stress-driven nonlocal elasticity model in conjunction with an arc-length solution strategy.",

    "Abstract": "While the classic ungrounded tuned mass damper inerter (TMDI) benefits from structural simplicity and engineering adaptability, its performance is diminished due to the negative stiffness effect resulting from direct inerter-primary structure coupling. This study introduces a novel hierarchical tuned mass damper inerter (H-TMDI), which incorporates a TMD subsystem between the conventional ungrounded TMDI and the primary structure. Hierarchical configuration mitigates the negative stiffness effects inherent in traditional ungrounded TMDI systems while achieving enhanced control performance. We establish the mechanical model of the inerter element and derive the governing equations for the H-TMDI dynamic system. Through H∞ norm and H 2 norm optimization, we systematically evaluate the control parameters and performance characteristics. The results demonstrate that H-TMDI achieves superior control efficacy under harmonic excitation. A comprehensive parametric study examines the influence of critical factors, including mass distribution ratio of two-stage systems, normalized apparent mass, and total mass ratio on vibration attenuation performance. It is revealed by robustness analysis that the H-TMDI outperforms the conventional TMD in three key aspects: enhanced peak attenuation in the main structure's transfer function, broader vibration reduction bandwidth, and reduced sensitivity to parameter variations. A closed-form expression for the H-TMDI control force is formulated, revealing the fundamental mechanism responsible for eliminating the negative stiffness effects. From a control system structural standpoint, the hierarchical design effectively decouples the inerter from the main structure, thereby eliminating the inerter's negative stiffness effect while preserving its mass amplification capability, ultimately leading to enhanced system performance.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we focus on surface defects in steel and conduct an analysis of various detection methods for steel surface defects. The detection of steel surface defects is a crucial analysis that ensures the quality of steel production. To address challenges such as low detection accuracy and inadequate feature extraction capability in steel surface defect detection, an enhanced YOLOv8-based steel defect detection algorithm, GS-YOLO, is proposed and implemented for the stated analysis. The network neck is augmented with an information aggregation-distribution mechanism module (GD) to strengthen cross-scale information recognition for steel surface defects. Furthermore, a scale sequence feature fusion module (ScalSeq) is employed to capture both high-dimensional and low-dimensional detail information from feature maps, enabling a more comprehensive integration of multi-scale features and enhancing the model’s performance in addressing multi-scale challenges. In the context of NEU-DET, several experiments have been conducted within the YOLO environment. The results of these experiments indicate that the modified/improved GS-YOLO model has reached an accuracy of 76.6%. This is a 2.5% improvement over the original method, and in general, it outperforms other standard object identification models.",

A detailed analysis of relaxation parameter is also provided. Applications include: explicit regret bounds for the framework of Kaczmarz algorithm models, non-orthogonal Fourier expansions, and the use of regret estimates in modern machine learning models, including for noisy data, i.e., regret bounds for the noisy Kaczmarz algorithms. Motivated by machine-learning practice, our wider framework treats bounded operators (on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces), with updates realized as (block) Kaczmarz algorithms, leading to new and versatile results.",

    "Abstract": "Human Action Recognition (HAR) is essential for enabling mobile robots to interact intelligently and safely in human-centric environments. This study introduces a wireless-aware multimodal fusion framework that integrates millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar with vision sensing for real-time HAR, ensuring robustness even under fluctuating wireless and environmental conditions. Unlike prior multimodal HAR frameworks that assume stable connectivity, our design explicitly embeds wireless channel-state feedback into the fusion process, ensuring real-time adaptability under dynamic communication conditions. The radar modality captures motion kinematics via range–Doppler and point-cloud signatures, while the camera provides spatial and appearance cues. Latency on the prototype has been kept below 50 milliseconds, and the proper integration of these heterogeneous features is additionally safeguarded through a lightweight deep-learning pipeline using adaptive fusion weighting. All the experiment simulation Outcome results showed that the proposed system obtains recognition accuracy values of up to 92% and an F1-score of 0.91 which actually outperforms both vision-only having 84% accuracy along with radar-only with 86% accuracy baselines. The results prove that wireless–vision fusion is possible for deploying real-world mobile robots in which robustness to environmental uncertainty becomes very important. The work also establishes the framework of wireless sensing in supporting context-aware human–robot interaction.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores the impact of performance appraisal pressure and growth mindset on employee innovation in the retail industry. Purpose: The research aims to assess how performance appraisal pressure influences innovation behavior among retail employees, and how a growth mindset moderates this relationship. Method: A quantitative research approach was used, with data collected through an online questionnaire distributed to 200 employees from various retail settings. The survey measured the level of performance appraisal pressure, growth mindset, and employee innovation. Data were analyzed using SPSS, with reliability analysis, correlation, and regression techniques employed to examine the relationships between the variables. Results: The findings show that moderate levels of performance appraisal pressure enhance employee innovation, while excessive pressure negatively impacts it. Furthermore, a growth mindset was found to positively moderate the relationship between performance pressure and innovation, enabling employees to perceive challenges as opportunities for growth. The study’s results underscore the importance of balancing performance pressure and fostering a growth mindset to boost innovation. Retail managers should consider designing appraisal systems that encourage moderate pressure and support employees in developing a growth mindset to drive innovation in the workplace.",

    "Abstract": "Osteomyelitis is a devastating bone disease caused by bacterial infection, the treatment of which remains challenging due to bacterial biofilm formation and impaired bone regeneration. The development of an integrated therapeutic platform capable of locally filling bone defects, enabling controlled drug release, and modulating the infectious microenvironment is of crucial importance. This study constructed an injectable self-healing hydrogel based on Schiff base bonds for pH-triggered delivery of ZIF-8-loaded curcumin, aiming to achieve synergistic therapy for osteomyelitis. Curcumin-encapsulated zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 nanoparticles were synthesized via a one-pot method and embedded into an oxidized starch–gelatin hydrogel network formed by dynamic Schiff base crosslinking, yielding the composite hydrogel. Systematic characterization revealed that the ZIF-8@Cur nanoparticles exhibited a well-defined rhombic dodecahedral structure, high crystallinity, and a curcumin encapsulation efficiency of 85%. The composite hydrogel demonstrated excellent injectability, rapid self-healing behavior, and remarkable pH-responsive drug release: under the acidic condition mimicking an infectious microenvironment (pH 5.5), the cumulative release over 72 hours reached 85%, significantly higher than the 25% observed at physiological pH 7.4. In vitro antibacterial assays confirmed its potent broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (&gt;98% inhibition). More importantly, the system effectively promoted macrophage polarization from pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory and reparative M2 phenotypes while exhibiting good biocompatibility. This study successfully developed an intelligent responsive injectable hydrogel delivery system integrating efficient antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory functions, offering a promising strategy for the comprehensive local treatment of osteomyelitis.",

In this article, utilizing phosphoric acid, pentaerythritol, phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5), and ethanolamine as raw materials, a novel nitrogen-phosphorus flame retardant is synthesized for the flame retardant treatment of polyester fibers. The flame-retardant polyester treated is characterized in terms of performance by means of TG-DSC, SEM, Limiting Oxygen Index testing, vertical burning testing, and tensile testing. With a flame retardant additive amount of 100 g/L, the damage length of the polyester sample strand is merely 4 cm, exhibiting no continuous burning or afterglow time, with an LOI value reaching 30.3%. This value surpasses that of untreated polyester by 11.2%. Furthermore, even after undergoing 50 cycles of water washing treatment, the LOI value remains above 30.0%. The polyester treated with the nitrogen-phosphorus flame retardant demonstrates reduced smoke, nearly no melting droplets, and flame retardancy characterized by both gas-phase and condensed-phase mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "Halloysite nanotubes (HNT) are hollow silicate nanotubes, ideal for drug delivery. In this work, we report a chain-length-dependent surfactant modification strategy to tailor the release kinetics of ibuprofen from halloysite nanotubes. Two types of anionic surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and sodium hexadecyl sulfonate (SHS), were selected to modify HNT and prepare two new drug carriers. Levofloxacin (LEV) was used as the model drug, and its sustained release behavior was studied in simulated gastric fluid (pH=1.2) after drug loading. SEM images show that organic modification does not affect the microstructure of the HNT. Thermogravimetric analysis reveals SDS-HNT exhibits greater weight loss than SHS-HNT or HNT, indicating superior SDS adsorption. This stems from SHS's lower solubility and longer hydrophobic chain hindering cavity loading. FT-IR results indicate that levofloxacin is mainly immobilized on modified HNT through electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interactions. Quantitatively, the modified carriers demonstrated significantly enhanced drug loading capacity: SDS-HNT achieved a maximum loading of 18.5 wt%, a 1.9-fold improvement over pristine HNT (9.7 wt%), while SHS-HNT reached 22.3 wt%, representing a 2.3-fold increase. Drug release studies showed that after 24 hours, SDS-HNT and SHS-HNT released 98.24% and 95.62% of their loaded LEV, respectively, compared to only 85.53% release from unmodified HNT. The release kinetics for all samples followed the Ritger-Peppas model. Combined with BET surface area analysis, the results indicate that surfactant modification, particularly with SHS, creates more accessible pore domains and alters surface chemistry. This transformation turns HNT from a carrier with slow and incomplete release into an efficient system enabling rapid and near-total drug release by reducing diffusion barriers and drug-carrier binding affinity. This study demonstrates that surfactant chain length and headgroup chemistry are critical levers for tuning the drug release performance of halloysite nanotube (HNT) carriers.",

XRD confirms α-Al 2 O 3 and γ-Al 2 O 3 phases, with higher crystallinity in CNTs/2024Al coatings. EDS detects C elements, indicating CNTs participation in film formation. Electrochemical tests in 0.5 wt.% NaCl show CNTs/2024Al-MAO has a lower corrosion current density (2.63 × 10 -7 A/cm 2 ) and higher charge transfer resistance, demonstrating superior corrosion resistance.

    "Abstract": "On 22 December 2018, a devastating tsunami struck Sunda Strait, Indonesia without warning. This incident claimed many lives, particularly in the Pandeglang Regency. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a tsunami reconstruction to analyze the tsunami risk, which can later be used as a basis for tsunami hazard mitigation. The tsunami reconstruction was carried out using numerical simulations considering seven landslide scenarios for calibration and two inundation model scenarios for comparison. In this study, we introduced a detailed inundation modeling and local risk assessment achieved by incorporating land use data from the national land cover map. The model results were validated against observed water surface elevation and field survey data of inundation heights. It was noted that the best scenario has a landslide volume of 0.326 km 3 . Among the two inundation model scenarios, it was found that the scenario with spatially varying Manning values was the best model with inundation heights accuracy of 95.39%. From the simulation results, the area with the highest tsunami wave of approximately 7 m was Tanjung Lesung. This result aligns with the tsunami risk analysis, suggesting that Tanjung Lesung was the most extensively affected area by the tsunami, with a total affected area of 3.225 km 2 and a risk level 1 area of 0.494 km 2 . This study highlights the importance of varying spatial characteristics of land use in the tsunami inundation modeling and risk analysis that is often neglected, which can be extended to other areas surrounding the Anak Krakatau.",

    "Abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs), primarily caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) using virulence factors like adhesins, toxins, and biofilms, are common bacterial infections with significant clinical and economic impact; rising antibiotic resistance demands new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. This review uniquely integrates UTI-specific pathogenesis, diagnostic challenges, and therapeutic nanotechnology strategies, while critically evaluating translational barriers. Current diagnostic techniques, including dipstick urinalysis, microscopic urinalysis, and urine culture, have limited sensitivities, specificities, and turnaround times. Nanotechnology offers promising advancements in UTI diagnosis and treatment with higher therapeutic efficacy than traditional methods. Nanoparticle-based biosensors and point-of-care devices facilitate rapid, sensitive, and specific detection of uropathogens and biomarkers. The delivery of antimicrobials using nanoparticles, such as silver, copper, zinc oxide, and selenium nanoparticles, enhances their effectiveness against resistant strains and biofilms, while reducing off-target effects. Additionally, organic nanoparticles, nanodiamonds, and green-synthesized nanoparticles exhibit antibacterial properties and improved drug delivery efficiency. Key challenges remain in nanoparticle characterization, manufacturing scalability, regulation of drug–device combinations, and rigorous renal-focused toxicology and pharmacokinetics. Overall, nanotechnology offers credible pathways for a faster diagnosis and more effective targeted UTI treatment. However, clinical translation requires a standardized evaluation, elucidation of the mechanism, and safety-by-design development.",

    "Abstract": "Efficient resource allocation for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms is a critical challenge, complicated by severe interference between UAV-to-UAV (U2U) and UAV-to-infrastructure (U2I) communications. Traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods often prove insufficient in this domain due to two fundamental limitations: the policy sacrifice phenomenon, wherein uncoordinated agent competition leads to suboptimal outcomes, and the curse of dimensionality, which impedes effective learning in large swarms. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Attention-based and Dynamic Gateway Multi-Agent Soft Actor-Critic (ADG-MASAC), a novel MARL framework. Our approach integrates a dynamic gateway mechanism to convert chaotic competition into structured collaboration via dynamic role assignment and an attention-based critic to enable precise perception of high-dimensional global states. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG-MASAC not only resolves the policy sacrifice issue but also achieves substantial performance gains in both U2U and U2I communications. Ablation studies further confirm that the synergy between these two mechanisms is essential for the algorithm’s success.",

    "Abstract": "Road infrastructure maintenance in developing countries faces unique challenges due to resource constraints and diverse environmental factors. This study addresses the critical need for efficient, accurate, and locally-relevant pavement distress detection methods in these regions. We present a novel deep learning approach combining YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models with a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) to simultaneously detect and classify multiple pavement distress types. The model demonstrates robust performance in detecting and classifying potholes, longitudinal cracks, alligator cracks, and raveling, with confidence scores ranging from 0.46 to 0.93. While some misclassifications occur in complex scenarios, these provide insights into unique challenges of pavement assessment in developing countries. Additionally, we developed a web-based application for real-time distress detection from images and videos. This research advances automated pavement distress detection and provides a tailored solution for developing countries, potentially improving road safety, optimizing maintenance strategies, and contributing to sustainable transportation infrastructure development.",

    "Abstract": "This investigation focuses on the design, synthesis, comprehensive analysis, and binding affinity with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 6 (CDK6) of a new 1,8-naphthyridine-pivalamide hybrid 1. The newly synthesised 1,8-naphthyridine-pivalamide hybrid 1 was characterised by FT-IR, 1 H NMR, elemental analysis, and single-crystal X-ray analysis. The crystal structure analysis disclosed that 1 is hydrated and supramolecular assembly is stabilized via O-H⋯N, N-H⋯O, and O-H⋯O and off-set 𝜋⋯𝜋 contacts. Various types of non-covalent contacts existing in the 1,8-naphthyridine-pivalamide hybrid 1 is explored, and subsequently quantified employing Hirshfeld surface analysis and 2D fingerprint plots. Furthermore, void study was utilised to examine the mechanical stability and presence of the cavity within the solid-state structure of 1. The interaction energies between molecules in 1 have been investigated using the interaction energy calculation. Geometric parameters of the optimized structure of 1 was determined utilizing the DFT calculations. Furthermore, molecular docking studies indicated that the 1,8-naphthyridine-pivalamide hybrid 1 demonstrated promising binding affinity with EGFR and CDK6, compared to their known inhibitors. The newly synthesized 1,8-naphthyridine-pivalamide hybrid 1 also exhibited drug-likeness as predicted by SwissADME.",

    "Abstract": "This paper examines ASEAN's role in the ongoing transition of regional order amid intensifying U.S.-China rivalry. It argues that both major powers are seeking to court ASEAN as part of their broader contest for leadership in the Indo-Pacific, recognizing that regional followership is essential to sustaining their strategic influence. Drawing on the three-pillar framework of international order, the paper contends that ASEAN's limited military capacity constrains its influence in the power-based pillar. However, ASEAN can still exert meaningful agency through institutional balancing, particularly within the institutional and normative pillars of the regional order. Specifically, ASEAN needs to pursue a strategy of selective engagement, i.e., promoting inclusive institutions, avoiding exclusive ones, and acting as a bridge-builder between competing powers, even as this task becomes increasingly challenging. The paper concludes that ASEAN's greatest test lies in maintaining its internal cohesion and unity. While the United States and China will remain the primary architects of the regional order transition, ASEAN's role as a stabilizing and mediating force should neither be overlooked nor underestimated.",

    "Abstract": "Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves graphical and spatial interpretation of the distributions of individual elements, an assessment of correlation between two or more elements, and unsupervised multivariate analysis of compositional data. It is an essential step in data analysis. Its purpose is to gain an understanding of the processes influencing geochemical data. An understanding of raw data distributions allows for the selection of appropriate data transformations as a precursor to parametric or robust statistical analysis of the data. Log transforms are used to de-skew mainly trace element distributions, although it should be recognised that many data sets contain multiple populations. Data may be levelled to correct for those processes identified through EDA. Compositional data is subject to geochemical closure which has the effect of creating false correlations, particularly where major elements vary due to fractionation, hydrothermal alteration or weathering. These effects are removed using the logs of element ratios. Correlation and regression analysis are used to infer geochemical processes from the data. The use of residuals following regression of a dependent variable against a controlling variable may be more informative than analysis of raw data. Statistical outliers, known as geochemical anomalies, can be identified in the data using well-established techniques.",

    "Abstract": "The global search for natural hydrogen has sparked a re-evaluation of all vintages of data in numerous geological regions. Legacy well data from Denmark indicate a potential occurrence of H 2 , which highlights the need for a full evaluation of data from the onshore Danish area. Based on a systematic review of 85 legacy well reports from the onshore parts of the Norwegian–Danish Basin and the Danish part of the North German Basin, we show that H 2 , He and N 2 are widespread across the Danish onshore region. Modern H 2 data are consistently low across onshore Denmark and fail to reproduce the elevated values recorded in the Tønder wells, located in the North German Basin, which were drilled during early oil and gas exploration activities in the 1950s. He concentrations vary from low to moderate, suggesting a possible commercial potential in parts of the onshore Danish region. The poor understanding of the deepest parts of the onshore Danish region, where potential sources for H 2 and He may be present, combined with the highly varying methods for sampling and analyses used for the reported H 2 and He occurrences, constitutes the main limitations for a deeper understanding of the subsurface fluid-gas system in the area. However, the Danish onshore region potentially encompasses several H 2 and He sources, which are associated with organic-rich, overmature radiogenic shales and granitoid basement. No areas with extensive serpentinisation have been recognised.",

    "Abstract": "High-resolution crosshole seismic surveying is a powerful technique for monitoring potential CO₂ leakage in the shallow subsurface and tracking the injection process. A setup employing a high-frequency seismic source in one well and a fibre-optic receiver array in another enables rapid and efficient seismic data acquisition, with repeat surveys allowing for time-lapse analysis. Such data were collected during the controlled shallow CO₂ release experiment at the CO2CRC's Otway International Test Centre in April 2024. Straight-ray tomography images from the initial surveys revealed a velocity anomaly near the injection interval, which migrated upward following the end of injection. To further investigate the CO₂ plume evolution, three additional surveys were conducted 10, 12, and 14 months after injection ceased. In this study, all crosshole datasets were analysed to provide a comprehensive overview of both short-term and long-term monitoring results. A new data processing workflow was developed, incorporating advanced tomography that accounts for seismic wave refraction caused by velocity variations in the medium. The updated results are consistent with previous findings but exhibit reduced uncertainty. The recent monitoring data indicate that the velocity anomaly near the injection zone persists but has decreased in size, while its further evolution continues at a slower rate compared to the initial post-injection period.",

    "Abstract": "Building on a knowledge-based prospectivity analysis conducted by the BGS in 2023, this study assessed the potential for sphalerite, galena, chalcopyrite, and pyrite from the Leadhills and Wanlockhead orefield (LWO), Southwest Scotland to host critical minerals. Utilising SEM and LA-ICP-MS, sphalerite was found to be the primary host for Ga, Ge and Ag, while chalcopyrite was identified as the primary host for In, Se, and Sn, and galena the primary host for Sb. For sphalerite, the geometric mean concentration of Ge was 200 ppm with a maximum value of 860 ppm. These values indicate significant enrichment of Ge in sphalerite relative to crustal abundances and are comparable to significant Ge-producing deposits like Red Dog, Alaska, and the formerly productive Noailhac-Saint Salvy deposit in France. Cadmium, Se, and As were found to be hosted by sphalerite, chalcopyrite, and pyrite respectively. These elements are known to have detrimental effects on human health and ecological and environmental systems. A further orefield-wide assessment of mine waste material to fully document the occurrence of sphalerite in veins and mine waste is recommended.",

    "Abstract": "In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. In this practically relevant setting, the sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for efficiently identifying the best possible solution across multiple attempts. However, suitable sequential alternative selection strategies have traditionally been studied separately across different research topics and have not been the exclusive focus of any existing review. As a result, the state-of-the-art remains fragmented for practitioners interested in this setting, with surveys either covering only subsets of relevant strategies or including approaches that rely on assumptions that are not feasible for the single-problem case. This work addresses the identified gap by providing a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic optimization. It brings together suitable strategies for this setting that have been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning, multi-start, and resource allocation. These strategies are described using a unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the construction of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them. The resulting comprehensive review facilitates both the identification and the development of strategies for the single-problem multi-attempt setting in practice.",

Together with prior preclinical and clinical evidence, these findings support a context-dependent model in which target downregulation predominates in HER2-low disease, whereas payload resistance or rare binding-site mutations may dominate resistance in HER2-addicted tumors, with important implications for antibody–drug conjugate selection and sequencing.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac involvement is the main determinant of adverse outcomes in Fabry disease. The study aimed to investigate cardiovascular outcomes in patients with Fabry disease. METHODS: This was a multicenter, retrospective, longitudinal study of consecutively referred adult patients with Fabry disease. The primary end point was the occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, major arrhythmic events, bradyarrhythmias requiring pacemaker implantation, and stroke. RESULTS: A total of 680 patients (age, 42.3±15.9 years; 41.0% male; 68.7% on disease-specific therapy) were included. During a median follow-up of 7.1 (interquartile range, 3.9–11.6) years, 92 patients (13.5%) experienced a major adverse cardiovascular event. At 10 years, freedom from major adverse cardiovascular event was 85.1% (95% CI, 81.3–88.2) and was lower in males compared with females (76.1% [95% CI, 68.9–81.9] versus 91.3% [95% CI, 87.0–94.2]; log-rank χ 2 =26.9; P &lt;0.001). On multivariable analysis, age (hazard ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01–1.06] per 1 year; P &lt;0.001), estimated glomerular filtration rate (hazard ratio, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.98–0.99] per 1 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 ; P &lt;0.001), QRS interval (hazard ratio, 1.02 [95% CI, 1.01–1.03] per 1 ms; P =0.002), and left ventricular mass index (hazard ratio, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.00–1.01] per 1 g/m 2 ; P =0.032) were independent predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events during follow-up.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Isolated coronary artery ectasia (CAE) is a less common form of CAE. The clinical significance of isolated CAE has not been elucidated yet. We aimed to compare the patients with myocardial infarction (MI) due to isolated CAE with the patients without CAE. METHODS: We retrospectively included patients who underwent coronary angiography with a diagnosis of first MI caused by isolated CAE. We excluded patients with &gt;20% stenosis in any vessel other than the lesion responsible for the MI. A second group of patients with MI without CAE was selected as the control group. The primary outcome was the composite of all-cause death and nonfatal recurrent MI occurring after index hospitalization. RESULTS: A total of 404 patients were included. Overall, 63.9% of MIs were ST-elevation MI. Almost all patients in the isolated CAE group had multivessel diffuse ectasia, with 71.3% classified as Markis I, and 26.7% as Markis II. Death or MI recurrence occurred in 54 (26.7%) patients in the isolated CAE group and 33 (16.3%) patients in the control group ( P =0.011). Death occurred in 8 (4.0%) patients in the isolated CAE group versus 6 (3.0%) patients in the control group; recurrent MI in 46 (22.8%) versus 27 (13.4%) patients, respectively. Stent thrombosis was more common in the CAE group compared with the control group (8.9% versus 1.5%; P &lt;0.001). In multiple variable analysis, the presence of CAE was associated with death/recurrent MI (hazard ratio, 1.84 [95% CI, 1.11–3.05]; P =0.017), and recurrent MI (hazard ratio, 2.07 [95% CI, 1.08–3.96]; P =0.029). CONCLUSIONS: The patients with MI due to isolated CAE had a higher risk of recurrent MI and stent thrombosis compared with the patients without CAE. In this study, the rate of recurrent MI from the index infarct artery was also higher in the patients with CAE.",

    "Abstract": "Fewer than 2% of eligible patients are screened for primary aldosteronism, despite evidence that early detection and targeted therapy are associated with lower cardiovascular and kidney morbidity. Recent updates to major hypertension and endocrine guidelines reflect growing recognition that primary aldosteronism is far more prevalent than previously understood and that broader, more practical screening approaches are needed. These recommendations increasingly extend screening beyond resistant hypertension to adults with stage 2 hypertension and even to all individuals with hypertension. They also aim to lower barriers to testing through more flexible guidance on antihypertensive medication management, reaffirm the aldosterone-to-renin ratio as the preferred initial test, and provide more standardized criteria for interpretation. Supporting evidence includes epidemiological data demonstrating a continuum of renin-independent aldosterone production across blood pressure categories, strong associations between untreated primary aldosteronism and adverse cardiovascular and kidney outcomes independent of blood pressure, and favorable cost-effectiveness of screening even in lower-risk groups. Implementation remains the principal challenge, with obstacles spanning patient, clinician, and health system levels. Emerging electronic health record strategies, including electronic phenotyping and integrated clinical decision support, have shown early promise in increasing screening uptake and streamlining diagnostic pathways. Collectively, contemporary guideline updates and implementation innovations represent a shift toward earlier and broader detection of primary aldosteronism, with the potential to reduce preventable cardiorenal disease across the hypertensive population.",

    "Abstract": "Extensive research documents the far-reaching consequences of social class, yet one fundamental question remains underexplored: Does social class shape how people construe death? We examine whether subjective social class is associated with distinct death attitudes and whether those attitudes, in turn, are related to suicidal ideation. Across Studies 1a and 1b, lower subjective social class was associated with greater escape acceptance, which involves viewing death as relief from life’s hardships. By contrast, neutral acceptance, approach acceptance, fear of death, and death avoidance showed no consistent association with social class. In Study 2, lower subjective social class was indirectly associated with greater suicidal ideation through higher escape acceptance, even after adjusting for depressive symptoms and exposure to threatening life events. Taken together, these findings reveal an overlooked implication of perceived social standing: Social class is linked not only to how people live but also to how they make meaning of death.",

This analysis identifies counternarratives of coping and survival among 21 midlife and older bisexual individuals. Findings are presented in three found poems followed by interpretations within participants’ life experiences. Each poem depicts an “act” of life, separating narratives into three stages of meaning-making. Act I: The Struggle captures early-to midlife experiences fraught with confusion, isolation, mental health challenges, and interpersonal conflict. In Act II: Coping and Survival Looks Like… participants reflect on strengths, skills, and relationships they used to confront significant challenges. Act III: Healing Bisexual Futures presents reflections on what bisexuality means to participants in later life and how they envision their futures. This streamlined version of complex and messy life histories represents an agentive story-telling process in which participants seek meaning and cohesion in narrating their lives. Creative methodologies are well-suited to capturing this narrative nuance and poignance.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cancer remains a leading global health burden. Artificial intelligence offers new opportunities to address complex physical and psychological symptoms in palliative and supportive cancer care. Despite rapid advances, including large language models, these technologies have not been consistently reviewed in this context, highlighting a gap in the synthesised literature. Aim: To map current evidence on how artificial intelligence is implemented in palliative and supportive care for people with cancer and their caregivers, and to identify associated challenges and future directions. Design: Scoping review guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) framework. Data sources: We searched PubMed, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases, along with grey literature, up to 17 September 2024, and manually screened reference lists. Results: Of 2618 records screened, 199 studies were included. Most applications supported healthcare professionals, mainly for predictive purposes such as prognosis, symptom monitoring, and treatment-related adverse events. Machine learning was the predominant approach, reflecting reliance on structured clinical data. Publications increased markedly after 2020, with a sharp rise from 2022 onwards. Only 26 studies involved direct use by people with cancer or their caregivers, and large language model–based applications remained rare, indicating limited patient-facing use. Conclusions: Artificial intelligence is increasingly being applied in palliative and supportive care, yet applications designed for direct patient or caregiver use remain scarce. Further efforts should prioritise the development and validation of ethically sound, clinically integrated artificial intelligence tools to support person-centred palliative and supportive care.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are targeted therapies for non-small cell lung cancer. However, their adverse reaction profiles remain incompletely understood. This study aims to evaluate the post-marketing adverse events (AEs) associated with selpercatinib and pralsetinib in real-world populations. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive analysis of AEs linked to selective RET inhibitors using advanced data mining techniques on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. Disproportionality analysis was performed to quantify the association between these drugs and AEs. Key metrics for disproportionality assessment included the reporting odds ratio (ROR), proportional reporting ratio, information component, and empirical Bayesian geometric mean. Result: A total of 522 and 917 AE reports were identified for selpercatinib and pralsetinib in lung cancer patients, with 209 and 312 preferred terms recorded for each drug. The most frequent AEs for selpercatinib included hepatobiliary disorders (ROR=10.71) and cardiac disorders (ROR=2.33). For pralsetinib, the most common AEs were hepatobiliary disorders (ROR=2.57) and gastrointestinal disorders (ROR=1.53). Compared to pralsetinib, selpercatinib had a more increased risk of serious outcomes (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: This study provides critical insights into the established and potential adverse events associated with selpercatinib and pralsetinib. The findings offer valuable evidence to guide the clinical use of RET inhibitors.",

    "Abstract": "Chicken lymphomas are generally classified into three virus-induced tumors: Marek’s disease (MD), lymphoid leukosis, and reticuloendotheliosis, with MD being the most common T-cell lymphoma in commercial poultry. In this study, we describe 23 cases of a novel cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma affecting layer chickens aged &gt;1 year in Japan that is distinct from previously known chicken lymphomas. These cases were initially misidentified as MD during routine poultry inspection but were later confirmed as a distinct and novel form of lymphoma. The average incidence of this lymphoma was 0.016%. Histological analysis revealed that the tumors comprised small uniformly round cells that were CD3 + , CD4 − , and CD8 + , indicating a cytotoxic T-cell origin. Investigations using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction ruled out the involvement of known tumor-inducing viruses in the development of these novel lymphomas. These findings confirm the existence of a novel lymphoma type in chickens and provide key histopathological and epidemiological data to aid in definitive diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "Background: In 2023, the first North American Hip Arthroscopy Registry was released: the Hip Surgical Treatment Registry (HipSTR). HipSTR is a prospective web-based data collection registry designed to gather baseline patient information, procedural data, and surgical outcomes. Purpose: To present the initial demographic and surgical overview data for patients enrolled in 2023. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Beta testing of HipSTR occurred between February 2023 and July 23, 2023, by 7 surgeons on &gt;400 patients. Starting July 23, 2023, HipSTR was made available for enrollment by North American orthopaedic surgeons. HipSTR is a free, digitally administered registry integrated with cloud-based (Patient IQ) outcome database capturing preoperative demographics, patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures, and intraoperative surgical data. Results: As of December 31, 2023, 14 surgical sites with 21 participating surgeons were enrolling hip arthroscopy patients, totaling 1098 patients in the calendar year 2023. The registry included 65% female patients and 34% male patients, with a mean age of 36.6 ± 14 years. Baseline compliance was 90%. Mean preoperative PRO measures (the 12-item International Hip Outcome Tool, EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level Visual Analog Scale, and Hip Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation scores) were 39.7 ± 19.0, 69.6 ± 19.6 and 39.1 ± 21.7, respectively, indicating the significant impact of their hip pain. In total, 315 patients described themselves as an athlete. Surgical findings revealed a variety of hip pathology, including 45% CAM lesions, 43% labral tears, 38% acetabular chondral lesions, 26% pincer morphology. Among patients with CAM and pincer/anterior inferior iliac spine morphology, 98% and 75% underwent femoral osteoplasty and acetabuloplasty, respectively. Additionally, 56% of all patients with acetabular cartilage injury underwent acetabular chondroplasty and 9% underwent microfracture. Notably, 16% of patients had prior surgery on their affected hip. Formal capsulotomies were performed in 68.3% of patients and of these, 83% had their capsulotomy fully repaired. Conclusion: These findings provide initial insights into the demographics and clinical profiles of North American patients undergoing hip arthroscopy as well as the types of procedures performed. These data, along with future contributions as the registry expands, will enhance understanding of the pathologies managed with hip arthroscopy, evaluate PRO measures to assess procedural efficacy, and guide efforts in the prevention and management of hip pain.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Authorship patterns in medical journals continue to evolve with expanding team science, academic incentives, and updated authorship guidance. Previous American Journal of Sports Medicine ( AJSM ) work (1994–2014) reported rising author counts and a growing share of international contributors. Hypothesis/Purpose: To update AJSM authorship trends (2014, 2019, 2020, and 2024) and test whether the past decade shows greater mean authors per article, more international and/or academic groups, and a higher proportion of nonphysician first authors. Study Design: Cross-sectional bibliometric analysis. Methods: We reviewed AJSM articles in 2014, 2019, 2020, and 2024 via the journal archive; editorials, letters, society news, and corrigenda were excluded. For each article, we recorded the first/last author's highest degree and sex, the number of authors, country (United States vs international), and institution type (academic vs nonacademic). Articles with &gt;20 authors were excluded. Differences across years were tested with a chi-square test (Bonferroni-adjusted α = .0083) and a 1-way analysis of variance with the Tukey honest significant difference post hoc test. Results: A total of 1482 articles met the inclusion criteria (2014: n = 336; 2019: n = 383; 2020: n = 383; and 2024: n = 380). Article volume did not differ significantly across years (χ 2 [3] = 4.30; P = .23). From 2014 to 2024, article volume increased by 13.1%. Mean authors per article increased from 5.82 (2014) to 6.47 (2019), 6.55 (2020), and 7.02 (2024) ( F [3,1470] = 15.69; P &lt; .0001); all but the 2019 versus 2020 pairwise contrasts were significant. International groups increased from 42.6% (2014) to 51.3% (2024) (χ 2 [3] = 8.92; P = .03). No pairwise comparison met the Bonferroni threshold (α =.0083); the lowest P value was .0097 (2014 vs 2019). Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Science first authorship rose (χ 2 [3] = 13.78; P = .003), reaching 9% (2020) and 11% (2024). Sex distributions for first and last authors did not change (all P &gt; .05). Twelve articles exceeded the &gt;20-author cutoff and were excluded. Conclusion: From 2014 to 2024, AJSM authorship shows expanding team size, increased international participation, and a higher proportion of bachelor’s-level first authors—largely medical trainees—while sex representation remained stable. These patterns underscore the need for transparent contributorship and mentorship to maintain rigor as collaboration intensifies.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Static posterior shoulder subluxation (SPSL) is associated with both glenoid retroversion and altered acromial morphology. Although abnormal glenoid anatomy has been considered a crucial etiological factor, the biomechanical role of acromial anatomy remains incompletely understood. Hypothesis: Combined acromial and glenoid malalignment would produce greater posterior humeral head translation than either deformity alone, and targeted corrections could restore posterior stability. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Six fresh-frozen cadaveric shoulders underwent testing in a 6 degrees of freedom, 8-muscle actuated ex vivo cadaveric simulator. Seven conditions were tested: (1) intact, (2) posterior labral detachment, (3) isolated glenoid malalignment (–15° retroversion), (4) isolated acromial malalignment (high/flat), (5) combined malalignment, (6) acromial malalignment + glenoid correction + posterior acromial bone graft (PABG), (7) combined malalignment + PABG. Humeral head translation was measured during forward flexion at 30°, 50°, and 70° of elevation and normalized to glenoid width. Statistical analysis used repeated-measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. Results: Posterior labral detachment showed minimal effect (1.3% ± 2.4% translation). On average, isolated glenoid malalignment increased posterior translation by 29%, whereas isolated acromial malalignment produced 31% posterior translation. Combined malalignment resulted in 54% posterior translation ( P &lt; .05 for all comparisons), demonstrating additive effects. Glenoid correction with PABG partially restored humeral head translation, but did not restore glenohumeral centering, with a residual 20% posterior translation compared with the intact shoulder. Adding a PABG to the combined malalignment led to a measurable reduction in posterior translation. However, although the graft decreased translation by approximately 13%, it did not restore native kinematics. Conclusions: Glenoid as well as acromial malalignment alone is associated with pathological posterior translation of the humeral head across the glenoid upon simulated active elevation. Combined acromial and glenoid malalignment produces significantly greater posterior translation than either deformity alone. Clinical Relevance: Complete anatomic correction of both deformities is necessary to restore normal posterior shoulder kinematics, supporting a comprehensive surgical approach for SPSL treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction and Objective: Percutaneous nephrolithotomy percutaneous nephrostomy (PCNL) is a minimally invasive procedure for kidney stone removal traditionally guided by fluoroscopy. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and outcomes of radiation-free PCNL using ultrasonography alone compared with standard fluoroscopy-guided PCNL. Methods: A total of 63 PCNL cases were eligible for radiation-free PCNL, but 27 were excluded (intraoperatively aborted, ureteroscopy performed instead, preoperative complex anatomy). Of the remaining 36 cases eligible for radiation-free PCNL, 11 were converted intraoperatively to fluoroscopic-based PCNL. Postoperative computed tomography (CT) imaging was available for only 16 of the 25 radiation-free PCNL cases and 4 of the 11 converted cases. We designated these 16 prospective radiation-free PCNL cases (2024–2025) as Group A. For comparison purposes, we identified a historical case-matched cohort of 150 PCNLs. Of these, 67 were excluded (similar reasons), leaving 83 retrospective fluoroscopy-guided PCNL cases (2022–2024) called Group B. A subset of Group A cases was converted from radiation-free intraoperatively to fluoroscopy and were designated as Group C. The primary outcome was stone-free rate (SFR), assessed postoperatively by noncontrast CT (2–3 mm slices). Secondary outcomes included estimated blood loss, complication rates (Clavien–Dindo), and postoperative stone events. Results: The median preoperative stone burden was 35 mm in Group A and 27 mm in Groups B and C [p = 0.3]. SFR (Grade A) was comparable across Groups A, B, and C [38%, 30%, and 25%, respectively (p = 0.8)]. No differences were observed in complications or secondary outcomes. Conclusions: Radiation-free PCNL is feasible and yields comparable outcomes to standard fluoroscopy-guided PCNL, offering a promising method to reduce radiation exposure without compromising surgical success. However, we identified a consistent theme of poor visualization that prompted conversion to fluoroscopy for some of the cases. Innovation directed toward improving tool echogenicity is key to diffusing this technique.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Surgery is an essential component of breast cancer treatment. Surgical complications may impact receipt of adjuvant therapy and long-term outcomes. Differences in insurance coverage and access to care by patient age in the general U.S. population may affect breast cancer diagnosis and surgery and thus age comparisons in research. We compared postoperative outcomes following breast cancer surgery between age groups in the U.S. Military Health System, which provides beneficiaries access to comprehensive care across the lifespan. Methods We identified women aged ≥18 years with stage I–III breast cancer diagnosed from 2001 to 2014 undergoing surgery without reconstruction in the MilCanEpi database. Multivariable Poisson regression estimated the adjusted risk ratios (ARRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) in association with age at diagnosis (18-39, 40-49, 50-64, and ≥65) for 30-day general and breast complications (surgical site infection, seroma, hematoma, or lymphedema), reoperation, and hospital readmission while controlling for potential confounders. Results The study included 7835 women who were 18-39 (9.2%), 40-49 (23.6%), 50-64 (42.7%), and ≥65 (24.5%). The overall risk of general or breast complications did not differ significantly by age when controlled for demographic, tumor, and treatment variables. However, women aged 40-49 had a statistically increased adjusted risk of seroma (ARR = 1.50; 95% CI = 1.03-2.18) compared to women aged 50-64. No significant age-related differences were observed for reoperation or hospital readmission after adjustment. Conclusion In the Military Health System, the overall risk of 30-day postoperative complications and hospital readmissions were not statistically different by age after adjustment for clinical and demographic factors. The findings support that surgical decision-making continue to prioritize tumor characteristics, comorbidity burden, and other clinical factors rather than age alone when assessing perioperative risk.",

    "Abstract": "Vibration of plate structures in air (dry) and in contact with fluid (wet) is of great interest and practical importance in naval architecture and marine applications. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of the natural vibration frequency and mode of various plate structures under different boundary conditions and environments is essential, especially for early-stage ship structural designs. In this paper, the dry and wet vibrations of simply supported rectangular Mindlin plates are studied with emphasis on developing closed-form solutions of vibration frequencies and quantification of uncertainties of different types. In plate-fluid-interaction modeling, potential flow assumption is adopted for the fluid, while orthotropic thick-plate condition is used for starting the plate bending formulation. The coupling between the fluid and plate is achieved through the fluid–plate interface, where the pressure is the same across the fluid–plate interfaces and the fluid–plate contact is permanent. Closed-form analytical solutions of added mass due to hydrodynamic effects of the potential fluid with several typical boundary conditions are presented first, and then the differential governing equations of orthotropic Mindlin plate with added mass considered are derived for the first time. Subsequently, simple solutions of wet vibration frequency are presented for both Mindlin plate and Kirchhoff–Love plate. With the derived closed-form solutions, parametric study and comparison between these two plate models can be easily conducted. For a given fluid–plate interaction model, the variations of the obtained vibration frequency are further evaluated with probabilistic analysis and Monte–Carlo simulation by considering the uncertainties and variations of the influencing parameters. This study sheds significant light on the fundamental plate-fluid-interaction in terms of wet vibration and provides potential opportunities for further development in ship structural reliability, noise and comfortness management, and the control of acoustic signatures.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and ultrasound-based therapy techniques have emerged as viable complementary approaches to cancer treatment, since both have modulatory effects on the tumor microenvironment (TME). TCM is distinguished by its multicomponent and multitarget processes, whereas ultrasonic treatments provide noninvasive biophysical modification to improve medication transport, immunological activation, and vascular permeability. Despite growing recognition of the synergistic potential of these modalities, no comprehensive bibliometric examination of their confluence in TME research has yet been done. Methods: CiteSpace and VOSviewer were used to evaluate publications from the Web of Science Core Collection spanning from 2014 to 2024. A total of 771 relevant publications were used to create visual knowledge maps, highlight research hotspots, collaborative networks, and emerging trends, with a particular emphasis on studies that combined TCM and ultrasonography in cancer-related TME regulation. Results: Over the last decade, research at the interface of TCM and ultrasonic therapy has expanded rapidly. China has dominated this sector in terms of publication volume and worldwide influence, with strong partnerships with the United States and the United Kingdom. The core institutions include the Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Zhejiang University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The research field has shifted from basic studies on “cell proliferation” and “apoptosis” to more sophisticated inquiries into “immune microenvironment regulation,” “ultrasound-assisted drug delivery,” “nanomedicine,” and “synergistic therapy.” Conclusions: The combination of TCM and ultrasonic therapy in TME research represents a new multidisciplinary frontier that combines molecular biology, materials science, and clinical oncology. This bibliometric and knowledge atlas study emphasizes the expanding body of data supporting ultrasound-enhanced TCM therapies as a promising paradigm in cancer therapy. To fully realize their combined promise in precision oncology, future initiatives should focus on mechanistic validation, standardized clinical evaluation, and worldwide collaboration.",

    "Abstract": "Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) of the brain is a highly malignant (CNS WHO grade 4) embryonal neoplasm. Majority of AT/RTs occur in the posterior fossa although supratentorial examples may also be observed. Pathologically, the tumor typically consists of cells with rhabdoid morphology that are immunoreactive for synaptophysin, EMA, and variably for GFAP. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by observing loss of INI-1 or BRG-1 expression from the nucleus of the tumor cells. Little is known regarding the embryogenesis of AT/RT. We therefore present here a case of supratentorial AT/RT in a 3-year-old male who presented with fatigue, irritability, left facial drop, left sided weakness of arm and leg, headaches, and vomiting. Neuroimaging revealed a large tumor involving the basal ganglia and foramen of Monro. Neuropathologic examination of the resected tumor revealed morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular evidence of an AT/RT (Group 1, SHH subtype). The tumor cells additionally exhibited immunoreactivity for TTF-1 (also known as NKX2.1), which has been reported to be expressed in GABAergic precursor cells in the medial ganglionic eminence. This example may provide at least a small insight into embryonic origins of supratentorial AT/RT.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The 2019 KDOQI guidelines recommend fluoroscopy-guided placement of tunneled cuffed catheter tips within the right atrium. However, fluoroscopy may misidentify the cavoatrial junction. This study quantified the discrepancy between digital subtraction angiography and fluoroscopy in locating the cavoatrial junction and assessed its impact on intrathoracic central venous stenosis risk. Methods: This retrospective cohort study analyzed 90 patients with right internal jugular tunneled cuffed catheters who underwent DSA at our hospital between June 2023 and May 2025; digital subtraction angiography and fluoroscopy were compared in locating the cavoatrial junction. Catheter tips were classified by DSA-defined location: superior vena cava upper segment (Group A), lower segment (Group B), or right atrium (Group C). Intrathoracic central venous stenosis risks were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: The DSA-defined cavoatrial junction was consistently 21.64 ± 7.23 mm caudal to fluoroscopic landmarks. The incidence of central venous stenosis was 34.4%. Intrathoracic central venous stenosis incidence was significantly higher in Group A versus C ( p &lt; 0.0167) and Group B versus C ( p &lt; 0.0167). Catheter tip location within the superior vena cava was associated with 5.78-fold higher odds of intrathoracic central venous stenosis compared to placement within the right atrium (OR = 5.78, 95% CI: 1.75–19.06; p = 0.004). Conclusion: Fluoroscopy overestimates the cavoatrial junction position. Given that right atrium placement reduces intrathoracic central venous stenosis risk, advancing the catheter tip 10–30 mm beyond fluoroscopically guided landmarks constitutes a key maneuver for achieving accurate positioning. Implementation of this optimization strategy is associated with a 5.78-fold reduction in odds of intrathoracic central venous stenosis, providing actionable optimization for hemodialysis access management.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: This study aims to determine the impact and potential relationship between maturation rates of upper limb arteriovenous fistulas and a previous history of central venous catheter placement for hemodialysis. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on demographic and clinical data originating from vascular access procedures carried out at the prestigious National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition Salvador Zubiran (INCMNSZ) in Mexico City between the years 2008 and 2019. Utilizing univariate inferential statistical methods, a meticulous comparison of demographic variables, comorbidities, and other pertinent factors were performed to elucidate potential impacts on the maturation of upper limb arteriovenous fistulas. Statistical significance was determined at p &lt; 0.05, adopting a two-tailed approach. Results: The analysis encompassed a total of 174 autologous upper limb fistulas, with a median patient age of 47 years (IQR 33–63). No statistically significant differences were identified in maturation rates among patients with a previous history of tunneled, jugular, or subclavian catheters. No statistically significant difference was observed in patients with a history of peritoneal dialysis. While the primary objective revealed no statistically significant difference, a trend toward favorable fistula maturation was observed in patients with ⩽1 catheters ( p = 0.06). Conclusions: Although no statistically significant difference was observed, a trend favoring fistula maturation was noted in patients with ⩽1 catheter ( p = 0.06). With a larger sample size, results supporting the main hypothesis of this study may be identified.",

    "Abstract": "Importance: Venipuncture is among the most common neonatal painful procedures. While several analgesic interventions (non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic) have been studied in the last two decades, their comparative efficacy is unknown. Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of different interventions for analgesia during venipuncture in neonates by a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA). Data sources: Medline, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase, and CIHAHL were searched from inception until March 2023. Study selection: Randomized and quasi-randomized clinical trials that evaluated different pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for analgesia during venipuncture were included. Data extraction and synthesis: Data from the included trials were extracted in duplicate. An NMA with frequentist random-effects model was used for data synthesis. Certainty of evidence (CoE) was assessed using GRADE. Main outcomes and measures: Pain scores during and 30 s after the venipuncture. Results: Of 95 full texts, 37 trials comparing 18 different analgesic measures were included. Three trials had a low risk of overall bias, 21 had some concerns and 13 had a high risk of overall bias. Among the 18 interventions for pain during the venipuncture, breastfeeding (including breastmilk; SMD −1.9 (−0.83, −3)) followed by non-nutritive sucking (SMD −1.69 (−0.27, −3.1)) had a high certainty of evidence (CoE) to reduce pain scores when compared to no intervention. Glucose and swaddling had low certainty of evidence to reduce pain scores. Conclusions and relevance: Among various non-pharmacological and pharmacological analgesics to reduce pain during and after the venipuncture in neonate, breastfeeding (including breast milk) was the best intervention to reduce pain during venipuncture, followed by NNS. Both these are feasible interventions in all settings.",

    "Abstract": "Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) remain the preferred vascular access for haemodialysis globally. Malaysia has a rapidly rising burden of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), but reported AVF outcomes vary across institutions, and no national synthesis has previously been performed. This review aimed to evaluate AVF outcomes in Malaysia, consolidate available evidence, and provide baseline reference values to guide future access planning and research. A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and Malaysian databases was conducted from inception to June 2025. Eligible studies reported outcomes of native AVFs in Malaysian populations. The primary outcome was 12-month primary patency. Secondary outcomes included primary failure (early thrombosis or non-maturation), maturation at ~6 weeks, complications and predictors of outcome. Random-effects meta-analysis was used. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2 and ROBINS-I. Twelve studies ( n = 1426 patients) were included: two randomized trials and ten observational cohorts. The pooled 12-month primary patency rate was 73.5% (95% CI, 62.4%–84.6%; I 2 = 93%, considerable heterogeneity). The pooled primary failure rate was 19.3% (95% CI, 14.1%–24.5%; I 2 = 69% – substantial heterogeneity), and pooled early maturation was 84.2% (95% CI, 78.1%–90.4%; I 2 = 73%, substantial heterogeneity). Upper-arm AVFs demonstrated consistently higher maturation than forearm sites. Diabetes, small vessel calibre and central venous catheter dependence were the most common predictors of poor outcome. Intraoperative heparin significantly reduced early thrombosis (RR 0.36; 95% CI, 0.13–0.99), whereas fish oil and aspirin had no measurable benefit. Complication profiles resembled international reports, dominated by stenosis and thrombosis. Malaysian AVF outcomes demonstrate favourable early maturation and acceptable 12-month patency, consistent with international experience despite a high comorbidity burden. These data provide the first consolidated national benchmark for vascular access outcomes in Malaysia and highlight priorities for future multicentre collaboration, surveillance strategies and standardized reporting.",

The Tasso+ device, a CE-certified system designed to collect 500 µL of whole blood, is generally regarded as safe and user-friendly. However, complications related to its use remain insufficiently documented. We describe the case of a female study participant who developed an unexpected wound complication after using the self-blood collection device. Although the blood collection itself was successful, the participant later required surgical treatment for a gaping lesion at the application site, which ultimately left a small permanent scar. To our knowledge, this represents a previously unreported adverse effect of the device.

    "Abstract": "Background: Conventional intraosseous (IO) access is typically reserved for emergency situations and limited to short-term use (⩽48 h). We introduce a novel, fully subcutaneous IO device designed to provide stable, longer-term vascular access in non-emergent settings. This device may benefit patients requiring intravenous therapies with challenging venous access or chronic kidney disease (CKD) who need to preserve peripheral and central veins for future arteriovenous fistula creation for hemodialysis. Aim and methods: This prospective, single-arm, first-in-human study evaluated the feasibility and safety of the fully subcutaneous IO device over a 7-day implant with daily infusions in patients with challenging venous access or CKD. Patency was assessed radiographically after placement, clinically during infusion visits, and either radiographically or clinically before explant. Usability and tolerability were evaluated through clinician and patient surveys. Safety was assessed by monitoring device-related adverse events for 30 days after explant. Results: Ten patients were successfully implanted with the device, and patency was maintained for a full 7-day duration without routine maintenance. Clinicians reported easy device implant, use, and explant. Three patients experienced pain during the first medullary infusion; one had additional pain during the second and third infusions. No patient discomfort was reported after day three. No adverse device effects (ADEs) occurred during the study or follow-up. Conclusion: This novel, fully subcutaneous IO device appears to be a feasible, usable, and safe option for short-term infusion therapy in patients with CKD or challenging venous access. These findings support further investigation into its use as a long-term intraosseous vascular access option.",

    "Abstract": "Endovascular stenting is the standard of care for superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction, providing rapid symptom relief and high technical success rates. However, no guidelines exist for the concurrent use of centrally inserted central catheters (CICCs) within stents or for optimal antithrombotic strategies. We report a case of a 69-year-old woman with malignant Superior Vena Cava Syndrome (SVCS) treated with a central venous stent (CVS) placement who subsequently required a jugular CICC for antibiotic therapy. Six days later, she developed recurrent edema. Imaging revealed extensive thrombosis involving the stent and adjacent veins, while ultrasound demonstrated a prominent fibroblastic sleeve (fibrin sheath) at the catheter entry site. Despite thrombo-aspiration and catheter removal, the sleeve persisted, exhibiting the characteristic “ghost sign.” Additional kissing stents restored partial patency, and anticoagulation was resumed. This case underscores the potential risks of placing a CICC within a previously inserted CVS. The coexistence of thrombosis and a fibroblastic sleeve on the same catheter—reported here for the first time—suggests that these entities, although distinct, can occur together. It is plausible that the flow reduction caused by the fibroblastic sleeve may increase the risk of thrombus formation, thereby raising the likelihood of stent thrombosis and recurrent SVCS. Imaging revealed that a fibroblastic sleeve, recognizable by the “ghost sign,” persisted even after catheter removal, underscoring the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of distinguishing it from thrombosis. Current guidelines do not address this situation, and data are limited. Until more evidence is available, clinicians should consider alternative access options—such as Femorally Inserted Central Catheters (FICCs)—when CVS are present and manage anticoagulation carefully. Multidisciplinary teamwork and regular follow-up are essential to improve outcomes and prevent recurrence.",

    "Abstract": "Cephalic arch stenosis (CAS) is a common cause of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) dysfunction. Angioplasty, with or without bare-metal stent, is associated with a high risk of early restenosis. The use of a stent graft at the cephalic arch is gaining popularity, as it improves patency rates and decreases the number of reinterventions. This case report describes a 65-year-old woman with end-stage renal failure who had a right brachiocephalic AVF created for haemodialysis. She suffered from cephalic arch stenosis, which repeatedly recurred despite multiple angioplasties. A stent graft was deployed but was complicated by twisting, leading to recurrent dysfunction. The twist was finally resolved with additional venous bare stents to provide mechanical support. This case highlights the potential complication of stent graft twisting and illustrates an endovascular solution to that. The underlying reasons for the twist are also postulated, which may provide insights for future treatment planning in CAS.",

    "Abstract": "Percutaneous peritoneal dialysis access procedures (PPAP) are commonly employed for peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter placement in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, traditional techniques such as the blind Seldinger method can lead to complications, particularly bowel perforation and catheter malposition. We report a safe and effective technique for PD catheter placement utilized in a 73-year-old male with ESRD. This novel approach involves lifting the abdominal wall and directly visualizing the puncture site with ultrasound, thereby minimizing the risk of bowel injury. Additionally, the combined use of transversus abdominis plane (TAP) and rectus sheath (RS) block provides effective postoperative analgesia. This technique is particularly beneficial in resource-limited settings, offering a safer, adaptable, and analgesia-optimized alternative for PD catheter placement.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Subcutaneous Anchor Securement System (SASS) are increasingly used for stabilization of vascular access devices. For many hemodialysis (HD) patients tunneled central venous catheters (t-CVC) are the last vascular access option and their unplanned replacement results in complex procedures and increased costs. Nevertheless, accidental dislodgment of hemodialysis t-CVC is a frequent occurrence in clinical practice. We here describe our first experience with SASS utilization in this unexplored setting. Methods: Between July 2022 and September 2023, we applied a SASS (SecurAcath ® ) to newly placed Tesio t-CVC in two HD centers. Patients were routinely monitored as per center standard protocol for accidental t-CVC dislodgment, tip migration, t-CVC dysfunction, early and late SASS-related complications, until a censoring event or the end of follow-up (December 2023) occurred. Data were retrospectively collected by two Authors per center, cross-checked, and analyzed with descriptive statistics in a case series. Results: Twenty-four Tesio t-CVC were included in the analysis. Among the entire cohort, the SASS (each with the corresponding t-CVC) were maintained for a total of 5.324 CVC-days. Median single device length of follow-up was 188 (144–276) days. Complete accidental dislodgment with cuff exposure and need for t-CVC replacement was never observed. One bleeding episode was reported among early complications. Infection incidence rate was 0.56 per 1.000 CVC-days and 71% of Tesio t-CVC with their SASS were still in use at the end of follow-up. Conclusions: This is the first report of the use of SASS in HD t-CVC. In our experience, SecurAcath ® was safe and effective for stabilization of Tesio t-CVC.",

    "Abstract": "Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) brings distinct experiences for families, especially around social communication and understanding certain behaviours, which may require tailored support and approaches. Best practice guidelines emphasise the need for timely post-diagnostic support for parents. This study explores parents’ experiences and perceived impact of a multidisciplinary psychoeducational workshop designed for parents of children with ASC, conducted in a child and young people’s mental health service in the east of London, UK. Using a qualitative design with Thematic Analysis, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 parents and carers who had attended the workshop within the past year. Findings revealed that parents found the workshop valuable, both for acquiring practical strategies to support their child and for fostering a sense of community. Some participants expressed a desire for earlier intervention and emphasised the need for follow-up support. Overall, parents reported increased understanding of their child’s condition, which contributed to greater acceptance and improved family dynamics. The findings suggest that such interventions may enhance parental confidence, reduce household stress, and positively impact both child and parent wellbeing. These insights highlight the importance of accessible, ongoing support for families navigating ASC-related challenges.",

    "Abstract": "Nail technicians face various hazards in their work environment, influenced by complex factors, involving not only nail technicians and owners but also customers. While significant research has focused on technicians’ health and safety views, customers’ perspectives remain underexplored. This study addresses this gap by assessing changes in customer attendance since COVID-19 and describing their perceptions of nail salon health and safety. Using an online survey, we analyzed responses from 428 participants. Over 50% of participants reported a change in their nail salon attendance since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic; 32% reported visiting more frequently, while 22% visited less often. Most customers expressed satisfaction with salon cleanliness (93%) and air quality (86%). Approximately half had no strong preference for technician glove (46%) or mask use (53%). In addition, 80% were unaware of products marketed as having fewer chemicals. Raising awareness among customers toward the vital of health and safety in nail salons—such as the benefits of technicians’ glove and mask use, as well as the merits of safer product use—can protect both customers and nail technicians. This study suggests that customers may be important partners in enhancing workplace health and safety. Future research should explore customers’ expectations regarding health and safety and their preferences for safer products, providing valuable insights for advocates and policymakers to effectively tailor educational programs/public health campaign for customers and improve health and safety standards in the beauty industry.",

    "Abstract": "Return of Mars samples is a high priority in the planetary science community and has remained an enduring goal of planetary exploration programs. Development of sterilization techniques to prevent potential contamination of Earth’s biosphere with unknown life-forms that could exist on planetary bodies requires the use of the most robust biological indicators. We argue that self-seeding proteinaceous particles (prions) represent the most robust biological agents found on Earth. To evaluate the impact of various sterilization techniques on prion activity, we used derivatives of yeast prion proteins Sup35 and Ure2, which are not harmful to humans. Our study demonstrated that effective antimicrobial modalities, which include prolonged dry heat (up to 200°C), vapor hydrogen peroxide, gamma irradiation (up to 100 kGy), and ambient air or wet He/water plasma (deposited energy density of up to 6.3 kJ/cm 2 ), did not eliminate the biological activity of yeast prions. However, ultraviolet C (UVC) irradiation at a wavelength of 260–270 nm for 16–24 days eliminated Ure2 prion detection and biological activity, and prolonged UVC irradiation eliminated detection of Sup35 prions and reduced, although did not eliminate, their biological activity. These data suggest that UVC could be an essential component of in-flight sterilization techniques for all future planetary missions.",

    "Abstract": "The global rise in fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance among Salmonella spp. has prompted the WHO to classify these strains as high-priority pathogens. However, the trade-offs between FQ resistance and bacterial fitness or virulence, along with the underlying mechanisms, remain insufficiently investigated. In this study, FQ-resistant Salmonella enterica strains were generated via artificial in vitro induction using ciprofloxacin (0.125–8 mg/L). We comprehensively characterized the resultant strains regarding multidrug resistance, biological fitness, pathogenicity, and genetic profiles. Results showed that induction via laboratory serial passage conferred multidrug resistance but imposed significant fitness costs, including flagella reduction, impaired motility, increased auto-aggregation, and enhanced biofilm formation. Notably, the resistant strains exhibited compromised adhesion and invasiveness, and animal models confirmed attenuated pathogenicity compared to the wild-type strain. Mechanistically, qPCR revealed significant downregulation of key virulence genes (e.g., spvB, ssaV, sipB , and pipB ), while resequencing identified specific mutations and indels in virulence and drug resistance loci. These findings elucidate the phenotypic and genetic shifts associated with FQ-induced resistance, offering critical insights for predicting infection outcomes and refining antimicrobial strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption has been implicated in various metabolic and urinary health issues, but its association with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between SSB intake and storage symptoms of LUTS, including urge incontinence and nocturia, among the U.S. women. Objective: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 13,555 participants, using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data, representing a nationally weighted population. Logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between SSB consumption and LUTS while adjusting for potential confounders such as age, body mass index, lifestyle factors, and comorbidities. Methods: This cross-sectional analysis utilized the NHANES data from 2005 to 2018. Women aged ≥ 20 years who completed the NHANES dietary and urological questionnaires were included ( n = 13,555). Exclusions included women with diabetes mellitus, pregnant women, and those with a history of uterine or cervical cancer. Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption was categorized into None (0 mL/day), Low (1–500 mL/day), Medium (501–1,000 mL/day), and High (&gt; 1,000 mL/day). LUTS related to storage were defined as urge incontinence and nocturia. Multivariate logistic regression models assessed associations, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors. Results: Among the 13,555 participants (weighted N = 92,765,231) in this study, the prevalence of nocturia was significantly higher in those with SSB consumption ( p &lt; 0.001). However, urge incontinence and nocturia were not associated with the quantity of SSB consumption after multivariable analysis. Common factors associated with urge incontinence and nocturia were old age, obesity, and depression. Conclusion: SSB consumption is not associated with storage symptoms of LUTS in our analysis. Due to the lack of certain variables in the database, further study is necessary to validate these findings.",

    "Abstract": "Background Studies show that beat-based cues from music and metronomes benefit gait in persons with progressive multiple sclerosis (PwPMS) during short walking. While useful for controlled assessment, prolonged walking better reflects real-world function. Adaptive beat-alignment algorithms using biofeedback may enhance synchronization and benefit gait dynamics but their effects in PwPMS remain unknown. Aims To investigate the effect of walking with and without an adaptive beat-alignment algorithm on synchronization consistency during 8 minutes of walking compared to walking in silence, and its effects on gait. We also examined how clinical factors like dynamic balance and cognition affect synchronization consistency during walking with music and metronomes, with and without adaptive beat alignment. Methods Healthy controls (HCs) and PwPMS walked for 8 minutes under 5 conditions: silence, music, and metronomes, with or without adaptive beat alignment, at their preferred pace. The algorithm adjusted phase and tempo in real time to restore baseline cadence. We measured synchronization, gait parameters, dynamics, and clinical outcomes. Results Twenty-one PwPMS and 18 HCs participated. Adaptive beat-alignment improved synchronization consistency and gait dynamics compared to fixed-tempo walking. Cognitive flexibility and working memory explained 10% of variance in the non-adaptive and 6% in the adaptive conditions, while dynamic balance (40%) impaired synchronization across both algorithms. Auditory cues resulted in slower walking and shorter strides compared to silence. Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility of adaptive beat-alignment strategies enhancing synchronization consistency and gait dynamics in PwPMS; however, cognitive flexibility, working memory, and dynamic balance influenced synchronization performance.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Brexpiprazole (BPZ), an antipsychotic drug introduced in 2018, is often used to manage psychiatric conditions. However, the effect of its use on infants whose mothers are receiving BPZ during lactation remains uncertain. Given the limited data on its effects on infants, this study evaluated the safety of its use by mothers during lactation. Materials and Methods: Three mother–infant pairs were assessed between 2018 and 2023 at Tohoku University Hospital. Each mother continued BPZ monotherapy (1–2 mg/day) during pregnancy and lactation within the first month postpartum, and data on maternal and infant health, as well as withdrawal symptoms or adverse events in newborns and infants, were collected from medical records. Results: No withdrawal symptoms or severe adverse events were noted in any of the three newborns or infants. Mild cases of neonatal jaundice and acne were observed in all three newborns and infants; however, they were considered unrelated to BPZ exposure. Nonetheless, it appears that the drug might have decreased milk supply, as supplemental formula feeding was occasionally necessary. Conclusion: This study suggests that BPZ monotherapy (1–2 mg/day) during lactation does not lead to withdrawal symptoms or serious adverse events in newborns or infants within the first month postpartum. This initial evidence may help inform breastfeeding decisions among mothers receiving BPZ monotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a complex, chronic disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction. While pharmacologic treatments remain the mainstay of symptom management, their long-term efficacy is limited and often accompanied by undesirable side effects. As a result, there is growing interest in non-pharmacologic interventions, particularly dietary therapies. Emerging literature suggests that whole food plant-based (WFPB) diets, which emphasize fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains while eliminating animal products and processed foods, may reduce systemic inflammation, improve pain thresholds, and enhance overall quality of life in chronic pain populations. Preliminary studies have shown promising associations between plant-based eating patterns and reductions in pain, fatigue, and depressive symptoms in fibromyalgia patients; however, evidence remains limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneous dietary definitions, and varying outcome measures. This literature review synthesizes current evidence on the potential role of WFPB diets in fibromyalgia management, highlights biological mechanisms underlying dietary influence on pain and inflammation, and identifies methodological gaps in the literature. By synthesizing and critically evaluating existing literatures, this review is both an exploratory commentary and a call for further research on the role of WFPB diets in fibromyalgia.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: Defining remission in atopic dermatitis (AD) remains challenging due to heterogeneous criteria and inconsistent endpoints. Current approaches often conflate good disease control with true remission, and few integrate multidomain assessments. This review proposes a functional spectrum of treatment response, ranging from nonresponse to complete treatment-free remission, incorporating both duration and treatment context. The framework distinguishes complete control on therapy, durable control over extended periods, response maintained after dose tapering, and sustained improvement following treatment cessation. Clinical, patient-reported, and immunological dimensions are considered, with emphasis on practical applicability to trial design. Opportunities for innovation include wearable technology, patient-reported digital tools, and predictive analytics to capture real-time disease dynamics and identify candidates for deep remission. By adopting standardized definitions and composite endpoints informed by disease biology and patient experience, future trials can more accurately measure meaningful, durable outcomes. Standardized remission criteria will improve cross-study comparability, guide therapeutic development, and align clinical care with the goal of long-term, treatment-free disease control in AD.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: Chronic hand eczema (CHE) is a frequent and heterogeneous condition associated with long-lasting symptoms, functional impairment, and high psychosocial and socioeconomic burden. Diagnostic evaluation relies on detailed history taking, physical examination, and patch testing, which remains the gold standard for identifying relevant sensitizations. Disease severity can be assessed with clinician-reported instruments, such as the Hand Eczema Severity Index, and patient-reported outcomes, particularly the Quality of Life in Hand Eczema Questionnaire (QOLHEQ). Management requires a structured, stepwise approach integrating preventive measures with pharmacological interventions. Topical corticosteroids remain the first-line treatment, whereas phototherapy and systemic options, including alitretinoin and immunosuppressants, are indicated in refractory cases. Recently, novel agents such as topical delgocitinib and biologics like dupilumab have expanded the therapeutic armamentarium, particularly for atopic CHE. Preventive strategies, implemented at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, are crucial for reducing recurrences and improving long-term outcomes. Despite these advances, there is still a lack of standardized diagnostic tools, validated severity measures, and evidence-based treatment algorithms. Future efforts should focus on patient-centered, multidisciplinary care and further research to optimize disease control and quality of life in CHE.",

    "Abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a prevalent, chronic inflammatory skin disease, impacting up to 20% of children and 3% of adults globally. Its pathogenesis is rooted in genetic susceptibility and immune dysregulation, but colonization by Staphylococcus aureus is a well-established critical exacerbating factor. While traditional research has focused on the direct damaging effects of S. aureus , such as toxin release and superantigen-driven inflammation, new evidence points to a more nuanced, indirect pathway. This emerging paradigm highlights the bacterium’s capacity to modulate host microRNA (miRNA) expression, representing a sophisticated epigenetic mechanism for worsening the disease. This review delivers a comprehensive analysis of the intersection between S. aureus infection and miRNA dysregulation in AD. It provides an extensive examination of shared miRNA signatures and offers detailed mechanistic insights into how specific bacterial virulence factors subvert host cellular processes to alter the miRNA landscape. The significant functional consequences of these changes are explored, demonstrating their detrimental impact on skin barrier integrity and the promotion of aberrant immune responses. Furthermore, we integrated a bioinformatic strategy to identify and validate common target genes and enriched biological pathways shared by AD and S. aureus infection. This systems-level perspective clarifies their synergistic role in driving disease pathogenesis. By synthesizing clinical findings from microbiology and dermatology with cutting-edge epigenetics and bolstering this synthesis with novel computational insights, this review offers a fresh perspective on AD pathogenesis. Ultimately, it pinpoints promising miRNA-directed avenues for future research and the development of innovative therapeutic strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstracts: Background: Hair dye-related allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is a common problem among both consumers and professionals. The main sensitizers are aromatic amines such as para-phenylenediamine (PPD) and toluene-2,5-diamine (TDA), which can also cross-react with chemically related compounds. Objective: To analyze patch-test results from patients with suspected hair dye-related ACD, focusing on the prevalence of sensitization to hair dye allergens, cross-reactivity patterns, and occupational differences. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 666 patients patch-tested between 2005 and 2023 at the Patch Test Clinic of Andreas Sygros Hospital, Athens, Greece. All patients were tested with the European baseline and extended hairdresser series. Results were evaluated according to the International Contact Dermatitis Research Group and European Society of Contact Dermatitis criteria. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for co-sensitization, adjusted for sex and age. Results: Overall, 82.4% of patients reacted to at least 1 allergen, with a median of 3 positive reactions. PPD was the most frequent allergen (47.9%), followed by TDA (35.9%) and nickel (41.1%). Significant co-sensitization was observed between PPD and several chemically related compounds, including 4-aminophenol, 3-aminophenol, benzocaine, textile dyes, hydroquinone, and pyrogallol ( P &lt; 0.001). Similar associations were observed for TDA. Hairdressers were younger (mean 32.2 vs 40.7 years, P &lt; 0.001) and had predominantly hand dermatitis (62.9%). Patients reacting to multiple hair dye components were significantly more likely to be sensitized to PPD. Co-sensitization between PPD and cocamidopropyl betaine likely reflected cosmetic co-exposure rather than structural cross-reactivity. Conclusions: PPD and TDA remain the dominant sensitizers in hair dye-related ACD, with strong cross-reactivity to aminophenols, benzocaine, and textile dyes. Extended patch testing is essential for accurate diagnosis, as 7% of para-amino–compound–sensitized patients would be missed by PPD testing alone. Occupational exposure and multi-allergen sensitization highlight the need for safer formulations and preventive strategies in hair dye use.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: Background: A monoclonal anti-interleukin-13 antibody, lebrikizumab, has demonstrated favorable efficacy for atopic dermatitis (AD). However, it is unclear whether early responses to lebrikizumab may be maintained for a longer term or whether patients without early responses may achieve delayed responses in real-world clinical practice. Objectives: To evaluate the sustainability of clinical outcomes achieved at week 16 of lebrikizumab plus topical corticosteroids (TCS) treatment for AD through week 48 and the achievement of delayed responses in patients without early clinical outcomes. Methods: This prospective study included 134 Japanese patients with moderate-to-severe AD treated with lebrikizumab plus TCS. Patients who achieved Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) 50, EASI 75, EASI 90, EASI 100, Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) 0/1, or Peak Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale (PP-NRS) 4 at week 16 were evaluated for maintenance rates of respective outcomes, while week 16 nonachievers were evaluated for delayed achievement rates of respective outcomes at weeks 24, 36, and 48. Results: In week 16 achievers, week 48 maintenance rates of EASI 50, EASI 75, EASI 90, and EASI 100 were 100%, 94.9%, 100%, and 87.5%, respectively, while those of IGA 0/1 and PP-NRS 4 were 86.7% and 97.1%, respectively. In week 16 nonachievers, week 48 achievement rates for EASI 50, EASI 75, EASI 90, and EASI 100 were 50.0%, 50.0%, 36.5%, and 3.4%, respectively, and those for IGA 0/1 and PP-NRS 4 were 26.5% and 23.1%, respectively. Conclusion: Improvements of rash and pruritus achieved at week 16 of lebrikizumab plus TCS treatment were mostly sustained through week 48.

    "Abstract": "Abstract: Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is linked to increased cardiovascular risk. While GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) show cardiometabolic benefits in the general population, their impact in patients with AD remains unclear. Objective: To evaluate whether GLP-1RA use is associated with a reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with AD. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used TriNetX Research Network. Patients with AD ≥12 years old who used GLP-1RAs between April 2005 and December 2020 were 1:1 propensity-score matched to patients with AD not on GLP-1RA by demographic and cardiovascular risk factors. The primary outcome was incidence of MACE (cerebrovascular disease [CVD], heart failure [HF], atherosclerosis, ischemic heart disease [IHD], and percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) at 5, 10, and 20 years post-index date. Results: Of the 547,246 patients with AD, 24,936 (4.6%) used GLP-1RAs. After propensity-matching, at 20 years, patients with AD on GLP-1RA had lower odds of CVD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.718 [0.643–0.800]), HF (aOR 0.791 [0.732–0.854]), atherosclerosis (aOR 0.768 [0.715–0.826]), and IHD (aOR 0.900 [0.841, 0.963]), compared with patients with AD not using GLP-1RAs. Conclusions: In patients with AD, GLP-1RA use was associated with a reduced long-term risk of CVD, HF, IHD, and atherosclerosis, highlighting their potential cardiometabolic benefit in this population.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a systemic inflammatory disease with notable psychological comorbidities, particularly depression. Sleep disturbance is common in AD and may mediate this relationship, but evidence from population data remains limited. Objective: To investigate the association between AD and depression, and evaluate the statistical mediating role of sleep disturbance using a nationally representative sample. Methods : Using data from 4177 adults in the 2005–2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We applied NHANES survey weights and complex sampling design to all analyses. Logistic regression models estimated the association between AD and depression, adjusting for key sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. A nonparametric bootstrap-based mediation analysis (5000 iterations) evaluated the indirect effect through sleep disturbance. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) models assessed potential nonlinear relationships. Results: After applying NHANES survey weights, AD was associated with greater odds of depression in the fully adjusted model (adjusted OR = 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01–2.23, P = 0.048). Sleep disturbance was found to be a significant statistical mediator, accounting for 21.2% (95% CI = 0.024–0.816, P = 0.026) of this total association. RCS models revealed a complex, nonlinear relationship between sleep quality and depression severity. Conclusion: In this nationally representative sample, AD is significantly associated with depression. Sleep disturbance statistically accounts for 21.2% of this relationship, suggesting it is an important pathway. These findings suggest that targeting sleep problems may be a valuable strategy to help reduce the psychological burden in AD patients.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: Background: Contact urticaria (CU) is an underdiagnosed condition representing a significant proportion of allergic skin diseases. Standard patch testing typically cannot detect immediate hypersensitivity reactions characteristic of CU. Despite the need for accurate diagnosis to guide management decisions, specialized immediate-testing protocols required for CU identification lack standardization and are not readily available at most dermatology/allergy centers. Objective: To present a practical CU testing protocol that addresses current diagnostic gaps for immediate-type reactions and can be implemented in dermatology/allergy practices. Methods: We describe our institutional protocol combining short-term occlusive testing with selective skin prick testing for CU diagnosis. The protocol includes patient selection criteria, allergen series and testing materials, step-by-step procedure, safety measures, clinic workflow optimization, and billing considerations. Conclusions: Our CU testing protocol is a method useful for diagnosing immediate hypersensitivity reactions missed by patch testing alone. Incorporating this technique may result in identification of culprit allergens and optimize management through targeted avoidance strategies.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines how the Palestinian Arab cultural elite in Israel, divided between institutional and custodian currents, navigates the intersecting pressures of national identity, political exclusion, and evolving cultural regimes. The findings reveal that the cultural elite is far from monolithic, comprising two interwoven yet distinct camps, each grounded in a common national identity but shaped by different generational experiences. Custodian elites, an older cohort formed when culture served as partisan resistance, remain rooted in party-affiliated associations and traditional literature, investing their ideological capital in community-driven, non-formal initiatives to preserve Palestinian collective memory. Institutional elites have emerged amid recent global social and political shifts. This younger, formally educated group operates within NGOs, municipal bodies and universities, combining commitment to the Palestinian narrative with liberal and cosmopolitan values, and harnessing digital media, multilingual networks, and diverse funding to drive policy-focused educational and cultural reforms. The findings also reveal that despite divergent orientations, these camps engage in dynamic exchange. Institutional actors draw on custodian narrative practices to legitimize innovation, while custodians utilize institutional platforms to expand the reach of Palestinian narratives, showing how progressive cosmopolitanism and identity-centered nationalism co-produce a multifaceted cultural leadership under Israeli exclusion. Two clusters of challenges are identified. Custodian elites face declining legitimacy and funding shortages as their traditional patriotic discourse loses appeal among younger audiences. Institutional elites contend with mistrust in Arab society due to partnerships with state bodies and dependence on government funding. Both groups share two obstacles: inter-elite struggles that dilute authority and the absence of robust cultural infrastructure or a coherent cultural vision.",

    "Abstract": "The liver is a multifunctional organ essential for detoxification, protein synthesis, glucose regulation, bile secretion, and drug metabolism. However, persistent damage leads to chronic inflammation, excessive extracellular matrix deposition, and progressive fibrosis culminating in cirrhosis, for which liver transplantation remains the only curative option. Yet, the scarcity of donor organs and risks of immune rejection underscore the urgent need for physiologically relevant in vitro liver models to investigate pathogenesis and facilitate therapeutic discovery. Current two-dimensional cultures and animal models fail to recapitulate the multicellular interactions that govern liver homeostasis and disease progression. Hepatocytes (Heps) constitute the primary parenchymal population, while hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) coordinate fibrogenic, angiogenic, and regenerative responses. Dysregulation of this crosstalk drives fibrosis and architectural collapse, highlighting the necessity for multicellular systems that mimic native liver complexity. In this study, we established a three-dimensional (3D) microtissue platform that recapitulates both the structural and functional characteristics of the human liver. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were differentiated into Heps, HSCs, and LSECs, which were subsequently cocultured within a self-organizing 3D microenvironment. We successfully reconstructed a miniaturized liver model that maintains hepatic functionality and exhibits steatogenic responses to alcohol exposure. This hiPSC-derived microtissue enables the modeling of chronic liver diseases, intercellular signaling, and fibrogenic pathways, thereby providing a translationally relevant system for mechanistic studies, drug toxicity testing, and personalized therapeutic development.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Fear of pain and reinjury significantly hinders return to sports (RTS) after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, the neural basis of this psychological barrier remains unclear. Hypothesis: ACLR patients will exhibit structural and functional brain changes in regions related to pain and emotion, influencing their psychological readiness to RTS. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Level of Evidence: Level 3. Methods: We recruited 36 ACLR patients and 36 healthy controls, collecting visual analog scale (VAS) scores for knee pain, Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport after Injury (ACL-RSI) scores, and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Results: Significant smaller gray matter (GM) volume was observed in the thalamus (effect size, −0.813), periaqueductal gray (PAG) (effect size, −0.737), and prefrontal cortex (PFC) (effect size, −0.690) in ACLR patients. We also found weakened functional connectivity between the PAG and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). GM volume in the thalamus was correlated positively with ACL-RSI scores ( r = 0.362). Notably, the effect of VAS scores on ACL-RSI was mediated by the reduced FC between PAG and ACC (direct effect, −2.071, indirect effect, −0.826). Conclusion: This study reveals that the psychological readiness to RTS after ACLR may be due to peripheral nociceptive input causing changes in pain-related brain structures and functions. Clinical Relevance: Recognizing these neuropsychological changes may guide comprehensive rehabilitation strategies post-ACLR, emphasizing the need for interventions targeting central neural mechanisms alongside physical recovery.",

    "Abstract": "Preventable readmissions represent a significant opportunity to improve quality and reduce healthcare costs, with approximately 26% of Medicare medicine readmissions considered preventable. However, evidence on the effectiveness of post-discharge interventions at scale remains mixed, and implementing evidence-based practices consistently across large, diverse health systems is a challenge. To address these concerns, the Mass General Brigham Population Health Services Organization (MGB PHSO) developed and implemented a novel, multidisciplinary, system-wide post-discharge intervention aimed at reducing 30-day readmissions within its Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) Accountable Care Organization (ACO). It was hypothesized that standardizing delivery through a high-fidelity workflow would reduce readmissions. A standardized, multidisciplinary program was created involving: (1) a coordinator conducting chart review and obtaining records; (2) a pharmacist performing medication reconciliation; and (3) a registered nurse completing a post-discharge assessment. A prospective cohort study was conducted comparing the outcomes of patients at pilot intervention sites with those of a propensity-matched control group. The intervention cohort showed a directional reduction in 30-day readmission rates compared to the matched controls (13.5% vs. 16.3%, P = 0.07) but no significant difference in 30-day emergency department presentations. The intervention group also had a significantly higher rate of 14-day follow-up appointments (70.0% vs. 65.3%, P = 0.025). These findings support the effectiveness of a centralized, standardized post-discharge strategy for reducing readmissions within an ACO setting. This study demonstrates that structured, system-level interventions can improve care transitions and outcomes in value-based care models.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: A major roadblock to the investigation of emerging “omic” technologies is the availability of clinically derived tumor tissue. This problem is compounded by tissue being processed in labs using formalin-fixation, paraffin-embedding. A novel approach that circumvents these barriers was developed and tested. This approach represents an opportunity for biobanks to generate hard-to-obtain specimens from clinical tumor specimens for emerging “omic” research studies. Objectives: This study demonstrates a specimen processing method capable of creating new samples dedicated for multi-omic studies from clinical tissues, all without detracting from the current formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded process. Methods: Using this new method, aliquots for the study of exosomes and metabolites can be generated from primary bladder cancers excised via transurethral resections. Once procured, the nature of tumor-derived exosomes can be examined using an exosome protein microRNA one-stop biosensor and metabolites via liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Intact cells are also recovered and can be prepared for examination by either Thin-Prep cytology methods or the creation of cell blocks. The latter methods are used to confirm the phenotype of the cells present in these aliquots. Results: Populations of diagnostic tumor cells were confirmed to be recovered and morphologically consistent with the originating parent tissue. Isolation and characterization of exosomes from these dedicated samples confirmed the presence of tumor-specific signal molecules. The untargeted profiling of other dedicated aliquots found identifiable metabolites of multiple different classes that had been extracted from these tumor cells. Conclusion: The fight against cancer will involve understanding its complexities. Developing technologies to under-studied analytes of cancer will be integral to this process. The adoption of the described tumor specimen processing approach in primary bladder cancer in this study represents a novel means for biobanks to generate and collect dedicated aliquots for research into these analytes of increasing importance.",

    "Abstract": "Named entity recognition (NER) is a core task in natural language processing that identifies and classifies entities, such as people, organizations, and locations within text. It has traditionally been applied in areas like text summarization, machine translation, and question answering. In recent years, NER has gained growing importance in health care, where electronic clinical records and online platforms generate large amounts of unstructured medical data. However, applying NER in clinical contexts introduces unique challenges due to the complexity of medical terminology and the need for high accuracy. In this study, we focused on the development of a real-time, low-latency NER system designed for cross-lingual speech-to-text applications, with a particular emphasis on cancer therapy-related clinical records and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). We explored the integration of deep learning (DL) architectures optimized for low-latency neural processing to extract structured information from multilingual spoken content in medical settings, particularly in multimodal environments. We evaluate DL-based methods and propose a semi-supervised approach that combines TCM-specific corpora with biomedical resources to improve recognition accuracy. The findings provide both a systematic review of current methods and practical insights for building real-time clinical applications that support decision-making and information management in health care.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this review was to examine socioecological risk factors for substance use among sexually and gender diverse (SGD) Latine youth and young adults (YYA). Methods: We conducted a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-guided search in PubMed, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and MEDLINE on July 16, 2025. Inclusion criteria were the following: (1) peer-reviewed journal article published on or after January 2014; (2) sample aged between 10 and 29 years old; (3) intersectional analysis of Latine and SGD subsample; (4) analysis for associative or predictive properties of individual-level, interpersonal-level, and/or structural-level risk factors with substance use. Studies that failed to meet all criteria were excluded. The quality of articles was assessed using the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies and the Quality of Reporting of Observational Longitudinal Research tool. Results: Twelve studies were included in the final synthesis, the majority being cross-sectional studies (9, 75%) with youth/adolescent samples (8, 67%). Outcomes from reviewed studies indicated that depression and psychological distress were associated with substance use among SGD Latine YYA. In addition, victimization, discrimination, and absence of social support contributed to substance use among SGD Latine YYA. Conclusions: Outcomes from reviewed studies prompt targeted consideration of individual-level mental health and interpersonal-level discrimination and support as it relates to substance use prevention and intervention among SGD Latine YYA. Future research should explore the intersecting cultural influences of being Latine and SGD on substance use and access to mental health and social support resources among SGD Latine YYA.",

    "Abstract": "Following a bioterrorism event, an incident or unified command is established, the impacted area characterized, and response work zones set up based on the extent of indoor/outdoor contamination. The personnel decontamination line, established in the contamination reduction zone, is essential for ensuring potentially biohazardous contamination on worker personal protective equipment (PPE) does not migrate outside of this zone. During personnel decontamination, conventional backpack or portable garden-type sprayers are often used to distribute liquid decontaminant onto PPE surfaces to physically remove and/or inactivate the contaminant. This process can lead to migration of biological contaminants and produces large volumes of liquid waste. A comparison of the performance of electrostatic sprayers and conventional backpack sprayers in personnel biological decontamination revealed that the electrostatic sprayer generated substantially less liquid runoff (∼75X), which would minimize waste generation and disposal costs following an event. Pilot-scale tests using manikins with PPE showed decontamination efficacy greater than 6 log 10 reduction (liquid and aerosol inoculation of spores) for the conventional backpack sprayer while decontamination was effective but incomplete with the electrostatic sprayer (&lt;6 log 10 reduction) with residual spores detected at “hard-to-reach” areas. Decontamination efficacy of the electrostatic sprayer was improved by increasing the spray time, as greater than 6 log 10 reduction was then observed (liquid and aerosol inoculation). Spore reaerosolization was higher during decontamination with the conventional backpack sprayer. The electrostatic sprayer as used in our study presents a viable decontamination option for a personnel decontamination line following biological agent contamination incidents.",

    "Abstract": "Far ultraviolet-C (UVC) is an emerging, flexible technology for indoor air disinfection with the potential to reduce airborne transmission of pathogens while maintaining safety for human tissues. Despite its high efficacy to neutralize a wide range of pathogens and safety for human tissues, implementation of far UVC is hampered by regulatory gaps, consumer uncertainty, and unanswered research questions surrounding the formation and interaction of generated ozone and volatile oxidative byproducts. This commentary describes targeted recommendations for both epidemic—where rapid far-UVC deployment and ability to counter a wide variety of pathogens in balanced with potential environmental impacts on the indoor environment—and long term implementation scenarios, highlighting the need for human health risk studies, regulatory guidance for fa- UVC devices, and real-world cost benefit analyses, which consider the tradeoffs long term of far UVC and germicidal ultraviolet implementation. Far-UVC technologies demonstrate an exciting opportunity to promote the benefits of germicidal UV disinfection to more indoor spaces. More research is needed, however, to ensure its safe and equitable use and development. This work was in part informed by a workshop held by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, which convened experts from academia, government, and industry to evaluate the scientific and policy considerations for far UVC, comparing the new technology to traditional germicidal ultraviolet.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, chlorogenic acid (CGA) was isolated from the methanolic extract of Prangos serpentinica, a plant adapted to serpentine soils known for their unique phytochemical profiles. Using preparative HPLC, 9.85 µg of CGA was obtained per milligram of extract. The isolated CGA was then utilized to synthesize a bio-inspired copper(0) nanocomposite (CGA-Cu(0)) through complexation with Cu(II) ions followed by chemical reduction using sodium borohydride. The resulting nanostructures were characterized by FT-IR, XRD, EDX, SEM, and TEM analyses, confirming the formation of metallic copper nanoparticles within the CGA matrix, with sizes ranging from 20 to 50 nm. The CGA-Cu(0) nanocomposite was then evaluated as a heterogeneous catalyst in the Henry reaction under aqueous conditions. Systematic optimization revealed that 3 mol% of the catalyst in water at 70 °C provided β-nitroalcohols in high yields. Control experiments indicated the superior catalytic performance of CGA-Cu(0) compared to its unreduced form and bulk copper. The developed system presents an eco-friendly, cost-effective, and plant-based alternative to conventional metal catalysts in C-C bond-forming reactions. This study reports the first usage of CGA-metal complex as a catalyst in organic reactions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The rapid evolution of viral antigens poses a major challenge to infectious disease control, particularly for pathogens like influenza that undergo frequent antigenic changes. While deep mutational scanning and platforms such as Nextstrain have advanced our understanding of mutation effects and population-level viral dynamics, they often rely on strain-level analyses that may overlook key within-strain antigenic changes. In this study, we adopted a site-based approach to systematically identify and analyze hemagglutinin (HA) mutations in influenza viruses that differed from vaccine strains, using publicly available genomic data. We found that nonsynonymous mutations exhibiting vaccine-associated allele frequency changes were significantly enriched in epitope regions in both pH1N1 and H3N2, and that pH1N1 showed a higher proportion of rapid allele-replacement events occurring within a single influenza season, whereas H3N2 substitutions more often occurred across multiple seasons. Geographically, several mutations displayed allele frequency changes correlated with local vaccination coverage. Phylogenetic analyses further revealed that five nonsynonymous mutations in H3N2 arose independently across multiple clades. Serological assays confirmed reduced neutralization for multiple pH1N1 mutations, and computational protein stability analyses indicated that observed mutations tended to increase protein stability in both subtypes, and that in pH1N1, potential epitope mutations were more stabilizing than those in non-epitope regions. By integrating bioinformatics with experimental validation, our approach provides a refined understanding of how selective pressures shape antigenic evolution at the site level, which could aid future studies on vaccine effectiveness and epidemic trends.",

    "Abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus, particularly methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), poses a persistent global health challenge. Genomic surveillance is essential but often hindered by the bioinformatics complexity of integrating multiple, disparate analysis tools. To address this, we developed StaphScope, a specialized computational pipeline for the comprehensive genotyping of S. aureus. Distributed as a single-install Conda package, StaphScope integrates six core analyses-Multi-Locus Sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcal protein A (spa) typing, staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) characterization, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling, virulence factor screening, and plasmid detection-within a unified workflow. It features intelligent resource management via the Python psutil library for efficient parallel execution. Validation using reference strains showed complete concordance with established types. Analysis of 24 S. aureus genomes identified prevalent lineages (e.g., ST5, ST9), diverse resistance mechanisms, and key virulence determinants, with the pipeline completing all analyses in estimated 10-14 min on a system with 16 CPU cores and 16 GB RAM. StaphScope generates consolidated, interactive HTML reports alongside structured data files (TSV, JSON). By streamlining access to integrated genomic analysis, it supports enhanced surveillance and outbreak response. The tool is available at: https://github.com/bbeckley-hub/staphscope-typing-tool.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Recent literature has reported declining attendance among certain medical student cohorts. The limited existing studies primarily explore attendance at lectures but not attendance on clinical attachments, which are mandatory for satisfactory student progression. This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing medical students’ decision to attend learning activities on clinical attachments, to optimise attendance and to formulate recommedations with respect to educational outcomes and the student experience. Methods Nine focus groups with clinical year medical students were conducted at a UK medical school, based at three different hospital sites ( n = 39). Thematic analysis of transcripts was performed (NVivo Software V14.23.2). Results Key factors which influenced medical students’ decision to attend clinical attachments were grouped into 6 main themes: (1) student factors, (2) learning activity factors, (3) assessment pressure, (4) organisational factors, (5) tutor factors, and (6) attendance monitoring. Fourteen sub-themes were then identified under these key themes. Specific factors that encouraged attendance included clustered learning activities that maximised student time efficiency and high tutor interactivity with an awareness of student-specific learning outcomes. Factors that discouraged attendance included a prioritisation of students for self-directed learning largely driven by exam pressure and a belief amongst some students that attendance on clinical attachments may not correlate with exam performance. Attendance may be optimised through clustering timetabled learning activities, transparently balancing self-study and timetabled activities, increased faculty development initiatives and further optimising university assessments to emphasise the skills acquired through patient exposure. Conclusions This study highlights the heterogenous decision-making relating to attendance among medical students on clinical attachments. The data presented may help to explain the declining attendance trends on clinical attachments observed in certain cohorts. Future research could quantitatively investigate the effect of specific recommendations to optimise both attendance and the student experience.",

    "Abstract": "This study reports 28 newly sequenced ancient human genomes from the Han Dynasty Xujiacundong and Zhouhe archaeological sites in Shandong Province, which are integrated with previously published regional datasets to investigate the genetic legacy of Neolithic Longshan populations in the formation of Han Chinese ancestry. Our analyses reveal pronounced genetic differentiation between Longshan populations from the Central Plain and lower Yellow River basin during the Late Neolithic period. Most individuals from the Xujiacundong site exhibit mixed ancestry, predominantly derived from Central Plain Longshan-related ancestry (93.8%) with a minor contribution from southeastern coastal China-related ancestry (6.2%). In contrast, all individuals from the Zhouhe site exhibit genetic homogeneity with Central Plain Longshan-related ancestry. These results indicate substantial genetic heterogeneity within the lower Yellow River basin during the Han Dynasty. Moreover, we found a high degree of genetic homogeneity between ancient Han Dynasty populations and modern Han Chinese from Shandong. Admixture modeling and f-statistics further demonstrate that Longshan-related ancestries-particularly those associated with the Central Plain-played a dominant role in shaping the genetic structure of historical populations across a wide geographic range, including the Upper Yellow River, the West Liao River Basin, and Southwest China, etc. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the profound and pervasive genetic influence of the Central Plain Longshan populations on surrounding regions, driving the demographic expansion and genetic homogenization of the Han Chinese. This interplay of population movements and cultural diffusion highlights the central role of Longshan-era demic expansion in shaping the genetic landscape and cohesion of the Han people.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Brincidofovir (BCV) is a novel nucleoside phosphonate analogue with unique dual antiviral and anti-tumor properties. Methods The activity of BCV was evaluated in 44 cell-line models, including T/NK-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T/NK-NHL, n = 25) and B-cell lymphoma (BCL, n = 19), and their respective NOD/SCID mice xenograft models. The potential immunogenic effects were examined in a syngeneic EL4-C57BL/6 murine lymphoma model. Results BCV demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity across the majority of cell lines regardless of EBV positivity, with IC50 values within clinically achievable human plasma concentrations (2 µg/ml) in 17 of 25 (68.0%) T/NK-NHL and in 13 of 19 (68.4%) BCL. In vivo treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth in all xenograft models compared to vehicle control. Notably, RNAseq analysis demonstrated BCV downregulated MYC-target pathways in T/NK-NHL models. BCV evoked S-phase cell cycle arrest, replication stress, DNA damage, and apoptosis while triggering STING pathway-mediated interferon responses, PD-L1 expression, and immunogenic cell death. In the EL4-C57BL/6 model, BCV in combination with anti-PD1 significantly inhibited tumor growth and triggered an immune reaction characterized by the highest scores for adaptive immune response, cytokines/chemokines and receptors, cytotoxic cells, dendritic cells, NK CD56dim cells, and neutrophils (NanoString Immunology Panel).

    "Abstract": "Abstract Mass spectrometry-based spatial omics is a powerful approach for visualizing the spatial organization of proteins, metabolites, lipids, and other biomolecules in situ, combining the molecular depth of mass spectrometry with spatially resolved imaging. This systematic review traces the rapid technological and computational evolution of this field, including innovations in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI), labeling-based approaches, and proximity labeling techniques. It also highlights recent advances that enhance spatial resolution, expand molecular coverage, and enable deep molecular characterization and review analytical pipelines that integrate deep learning, cross-modality registration, and cloud-optimized data formats. From the multimodal and practical perspective, the integration of MSI with other spatial omics platforms and its transformative applications in tumor microenvironment profiling, neurodegenerative disease, developmental biology, biomarker discovery, and precision medicine are discussed. Finally, this review outlines challenges and opportunities, emphasizing the need for standardization, clinical validation, and interpretable artificial intelligence to enable broader adoption. These advances position MS-based spatial omics as a foundational pillar for multimodal spatial biology and personalized healthcare.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Chemsex is defined as the use of psychoactive substances – most commonly methamphetamine, synthetic cathinones, and Gamma-hydroxybutyrate/Gamma butyrolactone (GHB/GBL) – to enhance sexual activity primarily among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM). It is associated with higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, HIV, and mental health conditions. However, despite substantial public health concerns regarding rising overdose deaths, the relationship between chemsex and overdose remains poorly studied. In this perspective, we synthesize the current evidence, identify critical knowledge gaps regarding the association between chemsex and overdose risk among GBM, and outline harm reduction and behavioral interventions. Assessing chemsex-related overdose deaths among GBM is challenging due to the limited documentation of sexual practices and sexual orientation in medical or legal records. Stigma further reduces disclosure, and chemsex involvement is rarely identifiable posthumously. Chemsex frequency and perceptions of harm also obscure problematic use. Effective pharmacologic treatments for stimulant dependence remain limited. In contrast, contingency management (CM) has been proven effective in reducing stimulant use, yet remains underutilized. Integrated harm reduction approaches are essential to mitigate the potential risks of chemsex. Key interventions include HIV testing, needle exchange, sexual health screenings, psychosocial interventions, and vaccinations. There is an urgent need for targeted research, improved data collection, and tailored harm reduction strategies to better understand and reduce overdose risk within chemsex contexts. Addressing these gaps is essential for reducing preventable deaths and improving health outcomes in this population.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) continues to pose significant public health in clinical settings due to its remarkable genomic plasticity and resistance to available therapeutic drugs, including carbapenems. Bacteriophage has emerged as an optimistic solution capable of addressing such drug resistance dilemma. This study represents a comprehensive characterization of a novel Acinetobacter phage with potential application against CRAB-associated wound infections. Methods Sewage sample was obtained, processed, and enriched with A. baumannii M13 phage(s) for the purpose of phages’ isolation. The isolated phage was examined using transmission electron microscope (TEM) and identified in terms of host range and efficiency of plating through spot test and plaque assay, respectively. Phage stability was screened following thermal, pH and ethanol assays. Replication kinetics were investigated through adsorption and single step growth curve. Furthermore, the in-vitro antibacterial potential was verified through measuring the optical density of the treated M13 culture at different Multiplicity of infections (MOIs) over 6 h shaking incubation. This is in tandem with preliminary screening of the vB_AbaM_MU1 safety through genomic and phylogenetic analysis of the isolated phage. Results A novel lytic Acinetobacter phage vB_AbaM_MU1 was isolated and categorized as T4-like Myovirus with genomic size 167.200 bp, which was classified into the family Straboviridae in class Caudoviricetes , based on morphological and genomic analyses. It showed lytic efficiency against 9/17 CRAB strains. Infectivity and structural integrity revealed thermal stability up to 60℃, pH tolerance within pH range (3–11), sensitivity to different EtOH concentrations (10%, 50%, 75%, and 95%). In addition, vB_AbaM_MU1 displayed distinctive infection kinetics with 6 min adsorption, short latent (over 30 min), and high bursting (326 PFU/infected cell). The in-vitro bacteriolytic infectivity revealed robust and steady antibacterial action at MOI of 1 and above. Conclusion These findings provide a strong, well-justified foundation for considering vB_AbaM_MU1 phage as successful candidate for phage therapy in treating CRAB- induced wound infections.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Dengue fever continues to exert significant global impact, affecting populations worldwide with considerable public health and economic consequences. There is no antiviral drug for dengue. This study focuses on hypericin, a naturally occurring compound from Hypericum perforatum L. whose anti-dengue properties have been underexplored. We systematically examined its antiviral efficacy against dengue virus (DENV), revealing strong inhibitory effects and clarifying its precise antiviral mechanism. Methods The study assessed the efficacy of hypericin against DENV using various scientific methods like plaque assays and Western blotting. We looked into its antiviral mechanism. We used a time-of-addition approach during our research. Moreover, the basic mechanisms involved were studied through molecular docking, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). Results This study demonstrated that hypericin exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity against DENV-2 in cell lines derived from multiple species. In time-of-addition experiments, it showed inhibitory effects under co-treatment, direct virucidal, and post-treatment conditions. Crucially, hypericin primarily blocked viral attachment and entry stages, thereby effectively reducing intracellular viral load. Mechanistic investigations revealed a interaction between hypericin and the E protein, evidenced by a computational docking score of -7.0 kcal/mol and an experimental SPR-derived Kd of 7.18 µM. Furthermore, Co-IP assays demonstrated that hypericin competitively blocks the association between the E protein and its cellular receptor, HSP70. Conclusion As per these findings, the E protein was seen to be a target of hypericin with an antiviral activity against DENV-2 at multiple stages by limiting viral adsorption and viral entry projecting a molecular basis for the candidate molecule as a possible anti-dengue agent.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Exploring barriers and enablers to participant recruitment into trials is a common discussion point in trial methodology. Participant information leaflets (PIL) can be long, have complexity above the average UK reading age, and may discourage engagement with research. This Study Within a Trial (SWAT) explored whether changing the design of a PIL influences recruitment rate and its value in patient decision-making. It was conducted within a host trial taking place in an emergency setting, where time is at a premium, and decisions on trial participation are needed more quickly than in most non-emergency settings. Methods We have conducted a randomised SWAT, comparing the standard format PIL with one that has been adapted to be visually appealing, with improved readability and reduced word count. Patients considered eligible for the host trial were provided with a randomly allocated PIL type; consent rates were compared. Those consenting to take part in the host trial were asked to complete a questionnaire to explore the value of the PIL in their decision-making to take part in the trial; responses were compared across the two information sheets. The sample size was dictated by host trial recruitment. Results Between September 2019 and September 2022, with a brief pause during the COVID19 pandemic, 271 participants were randomised to receive either the optimised PIL ( n = 138) or the conventional PIL ( n = 133). The recruitment rates were 47.1% (65/138) in the optimised PIL group and 48.9% (65/133) in the conventional PIL group; this difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.771). There were no significant differences in responses from participants recruited to the host trial who completed the Decision-Making Questionnaire. Conclusion Improving the readability and visual presentation of the participant information sheet provided to participants had no effect on recruitment rate, and did not appear to impact decision-making of recruited participants.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are the gold standard for evaluating treatment effects, with the results informing policy and clinical practice. To ensure appropriate methods are utilised and to avoid misinterpretation of the results of a clinical trial, it is vital that we understand the research question a trial aims to answer. However, there is often ambiguity in how trialists define their research questions. In 2019, an addendum to the international trial regulatory guidelines (ICH E9 (R1)) introduced the estimand framework to combat this. A review of protocols published in 2020 investigated the early adoption of the estimand framework and found no uptake as well as a lack of clarity on key items such as the handling of intercurrent events. The aim of this review was to identify the current application of the estimand framework specifically to trials with an adaptive design. Methods The search strategy aimed to identify trial protocols and statistical analysis plans that described RCTs published in two journals (BMJ Open and Trials) in 2023. Articles were eligible if they related to phase 2–4 trials with an adaptive design. A pre-piloted data extract form was used to extract data relating to study details, intercurrent events and estimands. Results One thousand five hundred and forty-one articles were identified by the initial search. Following screening, 146 articles were identified as meeting the eligibility criteria. Of the eligible articles, five (3%) stated their primary estimand, and of these, three (2%) stated all five estimand attributes. Ninety-four (64%) articles described one or more intercurrent events; these included a total of two hundred and thirty-two intercurrent events described. Fifty-two (36%) articles did not describe any intercurrent events. No articles specified the estimand for any planned interim analyses or considered the implications of adaptations on the primary estimand. Conclusions This review provides evidence that there is still a lack of uptake of the estimand framework in RCTs. Wider application of the estimand framework would ensure clarity in the reporting and interpretation of clinical trial results. In addition, clear guidance on how to implement the estimand framework to trials with an adaptive design is needed.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Aggression, substance use, and gambling behaviour often co-occur in a larger pattern of dysregulated behaviour. One of the factors that may underlie this phenomenon is impaired inhibitory control. Inhibitory Control Training (ICT) is an alternative intervention being tested for addressing addictive behaviours by targeting inhibitory control. Given the shared underlying mechanisms of these behaviours, applying ICT to aggression represents a possible extension of this intervention. This research will mark the first implementation of a cognitive bias modification approach to managing aggression among patients with co-occurring substance use disorder and gambling behaviour in the Indian context. A secondary aim of this study will be to assess whether changes in aggression and inhibitory control will be associated with reductions in substance use disorder and gambling behaviour. Methods A two-group, parallel randomized controlled trial will be carried out in 130 male in-patients at a tertiary care centre. Participants fulfilling the DSM-5 criteria for substance use disorders, and screening positive for problem (Score ≥ 1) or pathological (Score ≥ 5) gambling on the South Oaks Gambling Screen will be randomly allocated to either experimental (ICT) or control (Sham Training) group. The ICT consists of six 15-min sessions over three days, using a Go/No-Go paradigm with 100% contingency. ST is matched with the active training in terms of both stimulus exposure and response requirements, but reduces the contingency agreement to 50%, thereby preventing the formation of associations between aggressive stimuli and inhibitory responses. Primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, 1-day, 1-month, and 3-months post-intervention. Discussion As aggression is frequently observed in individuals with addictive behaviors and is closely linked to deficits in regulatory behaviour, the intervention, if proven efficacious, could offer a cost-effective and time-efficient alternative to traditional cognitive-behavioral and anger management interventions. Conversely, should the intervention prove ineffective, the findings would indicate that this may not be a potential area for further exploration in this population. Trial registration The study protocol was registered prospectively with the Clinical Trials Registry of India (CTRI) on August 07, 2024 (Registration Number: CTRI/2024/08/072033) (URL: https://ctri.nic.in/Clinicaltrials/rmaindet.php?trialid=113292&amp;EncHid=61291.44954&amp;modid=1&amp;compid=19 ).",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Seated exercises may reduce the need for in-person support during home-based exercise programs in people with balance impairments. However, it is uncertain if these exercises can transfer to improved lower extremity function and mobility. Thus, the objective is to investigate the effects of a remotely delivered 10-week seated exercise intervention on functional mobility, compared with control, in individuals living with a chronic stroke who have balance impairments. Methods The study is a multi-site, assessor blinded, randomized controlled trial that will recruit across five provinces in Canada using the CanStroke Recovery Trials platform. A total of 100 adults living with a chronic stroke (≥ 6 months post-stroke) and mobility impairment (using a walking aid) will be recruited. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to the 10-week Virtual Physical Activity Seated Exercise (V-PASE) or control group. All exercise sessions will be delivered one-on-one through videoconferencing by a trained instructor. Sessions will be 60 min in duration and completed 3 times/week at a moderate intensity (40%–60% Heart Rate Reserve). The primary outcome measure is the 30s Sit-To-Stand score at the end of the 10-week intervention. Secondary outcome measures will be mobility, balance, quality of life, stroke-related quality of life, cognition, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and blood profiles (glucose and lipids). Discussion Exercises completed in a chair have the potential to transfer to improved functional mobility in people with balance impairments, such as individuals with stroke. The stability of the seated position may improve safety during home-based exercises and thus increase participation. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05724823.

    "Abstract": "Trigonelline is an alkaloidal plant derived bioactive compound reported for its various pharmacological activities. Recent advances in the utilization of this compound in drug development have highlighted the importance of establishing a reproducible and efficient analytical method for estimating trigonelline (TRG) in both its pure form and formulated nano systems. Current research aims to develop and validate a green RP-HPLC method for estimating TRG by integrating Analytical Quality by Design (AQbD) with the principles of Green Analytical Chemistry. Optimization of the chromatographic conditions was done by employing a rotatable central composite design with amount of mobile phase and its flow rate selected as critical variables and tailing factor (T<sub>f</sub>), retention time (R<sub>t</sub>) and theoretical plates as the responses. Optimal separation was achieved using ethanol and water (40:60, v/v) on a Phenomenex C18 (250 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) column at 264 nm, yielding a sharp, symmetric peak at 5.60 min at a flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. Developed method exhibited excellent linearity over the range of 5-15 µg/mL (r² = 0.9986) with %RSD less than 2% and LOD & LOQ were found to be 0.628 µg/mL and 1.90 µg/mL, respectively. Forced degradation studies showed 12% degradation in acidic media and 9% in alkaline media after exposure of 8 h indicating moderate susceptibility to hydrolysis. Further, the validation was performed for the developed method according to ICH Q2(R1) guidelines. A comprehensive greenness assessment was performed using AES, GAPI, AGREE, AMGS, and AGSA tools, confirming that the newly developed method demonstrates superior greenness and its suitability for sustainable routine analysis compared to existing methods.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Ongoing antimalarial drug resistance surveillance is essential to guide effective treatment strategies. Historically, resistance to chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) has been associated with well-characterized mutations in the chloroquine resistance transporter ( Pfcrt ; K76T) and antifolate pathway genes, including dihydrofolate reductase ( Pfdhfr ; N51I, C59R, S108N) and dihydropteroate synthase ( Pfdhps; A437G, K540E, A581G). Since the introduction of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), 13 mutations in the kelch 13 (PfK13) propeller domain have emerged as World Health Organization (WHO) validated markers of partial artemisinin resistance. This study aimed to characterize temporal trends in both established, Pfcrt and Pfk13, and less well-described potential markers, cysteine desulfurase ( Pfnfs) and Pfcoronin , using febrile malaria samples collected across diverse regions of Kenya between 2013 and 2022. Methods The temporal trend of these markers of resistance were assessed by screening archived P. falciparum -positive dried blood spots (DBS). A total of 1750 DBS samples were collected from therapeutic efficacy studies (TES) conducted across distinct malaria transmission settings in Kenya, including coastal Kenya (Kwale 2013, n = 350; 2018, n = 150), the lake endemic region of Western Kenya (Kisumu 2015, n = 314; Busia 2016, n = 334), and the highland epidemic region of western Kenya (Kisii 2017, n = 314). Additional samples were obtained from an hrp2 study conducted in Kisii in 2022, ( n = 288). Parasite genomic DNA was extracted using the Chelex-saponin method and confirmed by a Pf 18S real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Pfk13, Pfcrt, Pfnfs , and Pfcoronin PCR amplicons were sequenced using capillary electrophoresis, Illumina Miseq or Oxford Nanopore (GridION) platforms. Results The prevalence of Pfcrt mutations declined over time and no WHO-validated Pfk13 mutations associated with artemisinin resistance were detected. However, synonymous substitutions at WHO-validated codons C469C and P553P were identified. In the Pfcoronin gene, nonsynonymous mutations distinct from those reported in West Africa were observed at high frequencies (&gt; 75%). Notably, the Pfnfs -K65Q mutation, previously associated with reduced lumefantrine sensitivity in West Africa, was detected in more than 80% of the samples. Conclusions Our findings reveal no WHO-validated k13 mutations up until 2022 and confirm previous findings of a reduction in the Pfcrt resistance genotypes over time. This study underscores the importance of continued molecular surveillance and suggests that resistance may evolve through different pathways in East compared with West Africa and Southeast Asia.

    "Abstract": "Step-wise construction of the multi-component plasmid in Stellar™ E. coli competent cells achieved successful modifications of a parent plasmid from a previous study by removing some DNA fragments, incorporating direct repeats and incorporating fluorescent marker gene cassettes (3xP3-DsRed and 3xP3-BFP) in desired locations. However, recombination events resulting in precise and repeatable deletions of small and large DNA fragments were obtained following incorporation of a target site for the in-cis-located I-SceI homing endonuclease into the plasmid. These events were also observed using other E. coli strains like SURE and NEB<sup>®</sup> Stable competent cells, although one clone from the NEB<sup>®</sup> Stable cells eventually yielded the expected plasmid construct. Analysis of the incorrect plasmids revealed that SSA-like and MMEJ-like DNA repair pathways appeared responsible for the recombination events encountered, suggesting that Aedes aegypti regulatory elements used for control of the homing endonuclease might be leaky in E. coli.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Wnt signaling pathway critically regulates the osteogenic differentiation in periodontal ligament stem cells (PDLSCs). However, the functional contributions of this pathway under inflammatory conditions remain unclear. This study investigated the effect and underlying mechanisms of the FRZB–Wnt5a–mitochondrial axis on the osteogenic differentiation capacity of PDLSCs under inflammatory conditions. PDLSCs were isolated from healthy teeth and exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic an inflammatory microenvironment. The Wnt pathway-related molecules were assessed, and the osteogenic differentiation capacity and mitochondrial function of PDLSCs were evaluated. To elucidate its regulatory role, we employed gene transfection to establish an FRZB (Frizzled-Related Protein) overexpression model. Results showed that inflammation significantly impaired osteogenic differentiation and activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Mitochondrial dysfunction was also observed, including reduced membrane potential, increased calcium and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, suppressed autophagic flux, and altered mitochondrial morphology. Notably, FRZB overexpression partially restored mitochondrial function and the osteogenic differentiation capacity of PDLSCs. These results demonstrated that FRZB serves as a pivotal regulator of osteogenic differentiation in PDLSCs. We found that inflammation downregulates FRZB expression, thereby activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling, which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and ultimately impairs osteogenesis. These findings reveal a mechanism by which inflammation suppresses osteogenesis in PDLSCs and highlight FRZB as a promising therapeutic target for periodontitis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Hospital-onset bacteraemia and fungaemia (HOB) has emerged as a novel surveillance metric in recent years and a prime target for automation of surveillance of healthcare-associated infections. However, real-life HOB data from European institutions remain scarce. This study explores the epidemiology of HOB at a German university hospital and describes characteristics of HOB cases. Methods A retrospective single-centre study was conducted by applying an extended version of the Providing a Roadmap for Infection Surveillance in Europe (PRAISE) automated HOB algorithm to data from the electronic health records of all in-hospital patients admitted to Charité university hospital between 2018 and 2022. HOB rates per 1,000 patient days were calculated for different groups of wards. Furthermore, the distribution of microorganisms, share of antimicrobial resistance, and source of possible secondary HOB (defined as HOB-causing pathogens detected in relevant clinical samples other than blood) were analysed. Additionally, patient characteristics and outcomes were investigated. Results A total of 3,648,254 patient days and 7,256 HOB with 8,357 microorganisms were included. The pooled HOB rate was 6.0 per 1,000 patient days in intensive care units, and between 0.9 and 2.0 in the various groups of non-intensive care units. Around 34.5% (n = 2,505) of HOB were deemed potentially secondary, with respiratory tract (37.6%, n = 943) being the most common source. A total of 1,106 of 8,357 (13.2%) microorganisms were classified as multidrug-resistant, including 60.5% (23 of 38) of Acinetobacter baumannii with resistance to carbapenems. Case fatality within 14 days of HOB onset was 16.2% (990 of 6,093 patients). Conclusions Analysis of electronic health record data provides important insights into the epidemiology and characteristics of HOB cases. Substantial rates of antimicrobial resistance and case fatality underscore the relevance of HOB as an IPC metric. Results from this study may inform refinement of algorithms for automated HOB surveillance.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Surgical site infections (SSIs) account for up to 20% of healthcare-associated infections and significantly increase morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Preoperative decolonization strategies—targeting nasal and/or skin colonization—are variably recommended across surgical disciplines. While benefits have been reported in elective arthroplasty, their efficacy in trauma surgery remains unclear. Methods We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook for systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD420250642382). MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Google Deep Research were searched up to 26 February 2025. Eligible studies reported on patients undergoing elective lower extremity joint arthroplasty or fracture surgery and compared nasal, skin, or combined decolonization protocols to standard care. Primary outcome was the incidence of SSIs. Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2 for RCTs and ROBINS-I for observational studies. Results Nineteen studies ( n = 64,796 patients) met inclusion criteria. Of those, five were RCTs and 14 were observational, retrospective or pre-post studies. 17 focused on elective arthroplasty; two addressed fracture surgery. Among orthopedic patients, nasal decolonization reduced SSIs with an OR of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.34–1.22), skin decolonization with an OR of 0.43 (95% CI, 0.29–0.64), and combined strategies with an OR of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.33–0.69). Trauma surgery data were limited and heterogeneous (I² = 81%); the pooled OR for combined decolonization was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.08–4.32), but with conflicting individual study results. Conclusion Nasal and skin decolonization protocols seem to reduce the incidence of SSIs in elective hip and knee arthroplasty. Thereby, skin, nasal and combined decolonization strategies may be used. However, current evidence in fracture surgery remains insufficient and inconsistent. High-quality randomized trials are urgently needed to evaluate decolonization efficacy in lower extremity trauma surgery.",

Similar selective pressures likely drove the evolution of analogous milk traits in sheep and goats. Consequently, the current study aimed to identify common selection signals for milk traits across dairy and non-dairy breeds of sheep and goats worldwide. Results In this study, a total of 308 whole-genome sequences from diverse sheep ( n = 108) and goat ( n = 200) breeds, including both dairy and non-dairy types, across the world were utilized. The population structure and genetic diversity of dairy and non-dairy sheep and goat breeds were characterized. Species-specific genes associated with milk traits, such as POU2F1 , ABCD2 , TRNAC-GCA in sheep and PRPF6 , VPS13C , TPD52L2 , NFX1 and B4GALT1 in goats, were identified. Further gene annotation and bioinformatics analyses indicated that different biological pathways are important for milk traits in each species: fatty acid oxidation and AMP metabolic process in sheep, the U2-type spliceosomal complex and propanoate metabolism in goats. Additionally, common signatures of selection such as CLASP1 , PDS5B , ZNF831 , CCDC73 were found in sheep and goats. Haplotype and transcriptional analyses further confirmed the role of these genes in milk production and provided evidence for their analogous evolution in sheep and goats. The CLASP1 gene was identified as a target of convergent selection, representing a promising candidate for genetic improvement programs in dairy species. Conclusions These results provide insights into the genetic basis of convergent dairy traits, offering valuable targets for improving milk production and advancing dairy sheep and goat breeding programs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background While the agricultural sector is a known contributor to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), the potential role of food loss and waste (FLW) in AMR dissemination has been largely overlooked. FLW, a byproduct of inefficient food systems, poses economic, environmental, and food security challenges. It may also act as a reservoir and vector for antimicrobial resistance genes and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, contributing to the environmental spread of AMR if improperly managed. This narrative review assessed the presence, fate, and risks of AMR in FLW management. Methods Peer-reviewed studies were identified through systematic searches in PubMed and Web of Science using keywords related to food waste, AMR, and treatment methods. Additional studies were retrieved through reference screening. Only English-language articles addressing AMR in the context of FLW were included. Results Bioconversion processes such as composting, anaerobic digestion, and conversion to animal feed can reduce antimicrobial resistance genes and antibiotic-resistant bacteria under optimized conditions. However, without adequate treatment, end products like fertilizers or biomaterials may still pose AMR risks. In contrast, FLW disposal in landfills and open dumps exacerbates both greenhouse gas emissions and AMR risks, due to co-contamination with other AMR-promoting pollutants like heavy metals and microplastics. AMR can spread through multiple pathways, including leachate, aerosols, wildlife, and direct human contact. Conclusions FLW should be recognized as a potential AMR source, requiring improved management strategies and integration into AMR surveillance. This review highlights the need to both reduce antimicrobial use and minimize FLW generation to limit environmental and public health risks. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Phlebotomus chinensis is the primary vector of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in China. However, the lack of a high-quality genome assembly for this species has limited research on its biology, vector-pathogen interactions, and evolutionary adaptations. To address this critical gap, the first chromosome-level genome assembly of Ph. chinensis was constructed. Methods Nanopore long-read sequencing served as the primary method, complemented by Illumina short-read sequencing for base-level error correction and Hi-C mapping for chromosomal anchoring and chromosome-level scaffolding. Genome annotation integrated transcriptome data from adult, larvae and pupae, homologous protein predictions from closely related sand fly species, and ab initio gene prediction. Comparative genomic analyses were further performed to explore evolutionary relationships and genomic differences between Ph. chinensis , Ph. papatasi , and Lutzomyia longipalpis . Results A total of 127.05 Gb of Nanopore data, 10.57 Gb of Illumina clean data, 52.95 Gb of Hi-C clean data, and 14.95 Gb of RNA-seq data were obtained. The final assembled genome size was 195.21 Mb with a scaffold N50 of 49.30 Mb, and 97.24% of the sequences were successfully anchored to 4 chromosomes. Annotation identified 10,909 protein-coding genes (91.48% of which were functionally annotatable), along with 73 rRNAs, 92 small RNAs, 82 regulatory RNAs, 374 tRNAs, 11,870 simple sequence repeats, 6053 tandem repeats, and 478,622 transposable elements. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Ph. chinensis is phylogenetically closest to Ph. papatasi , with an estimated divergence time of approximately 27.1 million years ago. Gene family evolution was dominated by contraction, with 229 expanded and 575 contracted gene families identified in the Ph. chinensis branch. Additionally, 209 positively selected genes were detected, which are crucial for immune response regulation and metabolic processes related to its vectorial capacity. Furthermore, 95 P450 genes were identified, classified into four subfamilies: CYP2, CYP3, mitochondrial CYP (mito), and CYP4. Conclusions A high-quality chromosome-level genome assembly of Ph. chinensis is reported here for the first time. This assembly serves as a critical genomic resource to advance research into the vector biology, insecticide resistance mechanisms, and evolutionary history, and lays a solid foundation for the development of precision VL control strategies in China.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective Immune dysregulation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of sepsis and COVID-19, with lymphopenia emerging as a consistent marker of severity and poor prognosis. However, most existing studies have assessed lymphocyte counts at isolated time points, limiting insights into their temporal behavior and prognostic value. The dynamics of lymphocyte recovery or persistence of lymphopenia remain largely unexplored in large populations, as well as the impact of adjunctive therapies such as corticosteroids. We hypothesized that the persistence or recovery of lymphopenia may be key to understanding disease progression and predicting outcomes. Using the multinational ISARIC cohort, we investigated longitudinal lymphocyte trajectories in hospitalized patients and the clinical determinants associated with their evolution over time. Methods We conducted a multinational prospective observational cohort study using data from the ISARIC-WHO Clinical Characterization Protocol. Patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and at least four lymphocyte measurements during the first 28 days of hospitalization were included. We analyzed lymphocyte trajectories, Cox regression survival analyses and multivariable linear regression modelling. We also applied multistate models and joint modeling to assess the association between lymphocyte trajectories and 28-day mortality, incorporating corticosteroid use as a time-varying covariate. Results Of 945,317 screened patients, 231,933 hospitalized adults with confirmed COVID-19 and sufficient lymphocyte data were included, with 56.6% classified as lymphopenic. Lymphopenia was independently associated with higher rates of ICU admission, organ support, and in-hospital mortality (OR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.48–1.55), and lower absolute lymphocyte counts were strongly linked to worse survival in adjusted Cox models (HR = 1.33 per 1 × 10⁹ cells/L decrease, 95% CI 1.28–1.38). Multistate modeling revealed that lymphopenic patients had a significantly higher daily transition rate to death and a shorter duration in that immune state, while corticosteroid exposure was associated with an increased likelihood of entering and remaining in lymphopenia. Joint modeling identified age, sex, and corticosteroid use as significant predictors of lower lymphocyte trajectories over time, with distinct dynamics between survivors and non-survivors. Conclusion Lymphopenia was common and strongly associated with worse outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with impaired recovery particularly evident in those receiving corticosteroids. These findings highlight the value of lymphocyte monitoring to inform tailored immunomodulatory strategies in sepsis and severe viral infections.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Hachijo Island, part of the Izu-Ogasawara Islands, is situated near major plate boundaries, including the Nankai Trough, Sagami Trough, and Izu-Ogasawara Trench, making it highly susceptible to tsunamis triggered by earthquakes in these regions. Despite this vulnerability, limited tsunami research has been conducted in the area. This study aimed to uncover the tsunami history of Hachijo Island through geological surveys and numerical modeling, providing insights into potential tsunami sources. The field investigation at west coast revealed an event layer characterized by rounded gravels which is comparable to previously recognized tsunami deposits in this area. Radiocarbon dating results indicate that these deposits formed after the seventeenth century. Based on the dating results together with sedimentary features such as cracks, the 1703 Genroku earthquake and tsunami is more likely because geological evidence fits the historical descriptions. Numerical simulations for the 1703 Genroku tsunami were conducted to evaluate the fault source responsible for the tsunami deposits. The runup height observed at west coast could not be reproduced using a previously proposed fault model. This research developed several revised fault models by changing parameters to reflect their influence on Hachijo Island. Among these, one model successfully reproduced the impact of tsunamis on both Hachijo Island and surrounding regions. The geological records of Hachijo Island provide key constraints for tsunami source modeling and highlight the importance of remote island data in tsunami hazard assessments. This study improves our understanding of tsunami risks in regions and provides a refined model to guide future research and disaster mitigation strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Long-term prediction of exchange-rate (XR) signals has been an interesting topic in statistics and finance. However, owing to strong fluctuations in XR signals, long-term prediction remains extremely difficult, and no consensus has been reached on an ideal approach that produces the best estimation accuracy. XR signals are known to be highly volatile (chaotic), which makes it difficult to model them via an accurate statistical framework. In this paper, we attempt to uncover the long-term system dynamics behind AUD/USD and EUR/GBP XR signals by modeling them with reduced stochasticity and minimized volatility in the form of a linear stochastic difference equation (LSDE) via the recursive least squares (RLS) regression approach. On the basis of these two well-known XRs, the simultaneous presence of inherent stochasticity and strong volatility makes prediction difficult for XR signals. Our findings indicate that under the use of a sufficiently large training sample size for RLS regression, the LSDE coefficients of XR signals assume values within a very small range (low variance) and behave relatively consistently in time (low volatility), which concurrently suppresses both their stochasticity and chaoticity, enabling long-term prediction under a reduction of more than 60% in the prediction error. This study aims to decrypt XR signal dynamics in terms of the underlying LSDE coefficients and to develop an accurate LSDE model with minimum uncertainty (stochasticity, volatility) that can overcome the hinderance of precise long-term prediction.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study explores the higher-order moments of connectedness among cryptocurrency, commodity, bond, and stock markets from April 19, 2017, to December 29, 2023, on the basis of the GARCH-SK and TVP-VAR models. The findings reveal that Bitcoin and Ethereum act as significant net shock transmitters, especially during major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia–Ukraine conflict. After mid-2021, these cryptocurrencies transitioned from net receivers to net transmitters of volatility owing to rising economic and geopolitical risks. These insights assist in portfolio diversification strategies. By combining shock transmitters with shock-resilient cryptocurrencies, investors can enhance their risk profiles. Diversification opportunities shift during financial crises, making it crucial to focus on shock transmitters, which are less influenced by various risk factors. Additionally, the study highlights cryptocurrencies as potential safe havens compared with traditional assets such as gold, bonds, and stocks, which often maintain or appreciate value during market stress. TVP-VAR-informed dynamic portfolio reallocation can improve risk-adjusted returns and lower volatility, aiding in capital preservation during high TCI periods. Overall, our findings suggest that portfolios that include cryptocurrencies generally outperform those that do not, emphasizing their role as effective diversifiers in portfolio optimization and financial stability.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Mindful eating serves as a therapeutic intervention for recognizing and gradually altering the established daily eating habits and patterns. Objectives This study aims to estimate the prevalence of adoption of principles of mindful eating among medical and non-medical university students and to detect the effect of adoption of mindful eating on the Body Mass Index of the studied subjects. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 576 undergraduate students using a structured self-administered questionnaire comprising sociodemographic data, perceived weight and height and Mindful Eating Questionnaire. Results The majority of the studied students (94.4%) were used to adopt Mindful eating. The percentages of medical and non-medical students were used to adopt Mindful eating were (97.6% and 91.3%, respectively). A statistically significant association was detected between the type of the study (faculty) and adoption of mindful eating (P-value = 0.001). Medical study permits adopting mindful eating by about 73.8% more than non-medical studies. Medical male students showed higher scores for the disinhibition subscale than females (P-value = 0.025) while non-medical female students showed higher scores for the awareness subscale than males (P-value = 0.006). Nearly three fourths of the studied subjects (74.3%) had Body Mass Index ≥ 25. The percentage of medical students (17.4%) having Body Mass Index ≥ 25 was less than the percentage of their non-medical peers (34.0%). The association between the type of the study (faculty) and Body Mass Index categories was statistically significant (P-value = &lt; 0.001). The higher scores on the Mindful Eating Questionnaire overall and on each of the categories except the awareness score had been associated with lower Body Mass Index. Most of the students adopting Mindful eating (75.4%) had Body Mass Index &lt; 25 as compared to their peers who did not adopt Mindful eating where more than one third of them (43.8%) had Body Mass Index ≥ 25. The association between Mindful eating summary score categories and Body Mass Index categories was statistically significant (P-value = 0.016). A significant negative weak correlation was detected between Mindful eating summary score categories and Body Mass Index categories (P-value = 0.044). Conclusion Academic background reinforces the potential of mindful eating as a viable strategy for promoting healthier eating habits and effective weight management among university students.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Depression is a prevalent psychiatric disorder associated with oxidative stress (OS), inflammation, and impaired neurogenesis. Vitamin D and exercise are known to improve brain functions and mood. This study aimed to assess their individual and combined effects on experimental depression in rats. Methods Fifty adult Wistar albino rats were divided into five groups: normal control, depression, depression + vitamin D, depression + exercise, and depression + vitamin D + exercise. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were measured using colorimetry. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were evaluated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and ELISA. Behavioral performance was evaluated using the open field test (OFT) and tail suspension test (TST). Results Reserpine administration induced a depressive-like state, evidenced by increased immobility time and reduced locomotor activity in the OFT and TST. Biochemically, it produced marked oxidative and inflammatory alterations, including elevated MDA and TNF-α with decreased GSH. Also, it decreased neurotransmitters; DA and NE, and BDNF. Treatment with either vitamin D or exercise partially ameliorated these alterations, but these improvements were not statistically different from values of the depressed groups. On the other hand, the combined vitamin D and exercise regimen yielded the most pronounced improvement, restoring behavioral, biochemical, and molecular parameters to become statistically indistinguishable from the normal values. Moreover, depression showed significant downregulation of VEGF and ERK at both gene and protein levels as compared to the normal control. Treatment with vitamin D or exercise alone improved VEGF and ERK to a similar extent (not statistically different vs depressed group), with the combined regimen produced the highest treated values to become non-statistically different from the normal. Conclusion Combined vitamin D supplementation and exercise produced greater antidepressant-like effects than either intervention alone, accompanied by improvements in behavioral, antioxidant, inflammatory, and neurotrophic markers. These changes were associated with parallel increases in VEGF and ERK expression, suggesting possible involvement of this signaling pathway. Further studies are needed to confirm the underlying mechanisms and support translation to clinical settings.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) represents a major global health burden, with incidence projected to reach 89.32 per 100,000 people by 2030. This systematic review examines how artificial intelligence (AI), particularly machine learning and deep learning, can enhance AIS care through improved diagnostic accuracy and outcome prediction. We synthesize evidence on AI applications in lesion segmentation and functional outcome forecasting, with emphasis on clinical translation and relevance for diverse healthcare settings. Current literature demonstrates that AI-assisted approaches achieve clinically meaningful performance, with segmentation models frequently showing Dice coefficients exceeding 0.85 and outcome prediction models achieving area under the curve values above 0.80. Integration of multimodal data, combining imaging features with clinical parameters such as Barthel Index, Modified Rankin Scale, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and Functional Independence Measure consistently enhances predictive accuracy. However, significant challenges persist, including demographic biases in training data, limited generalizability across populations, and reliance on small, single-center datasets. Ethical considerations around algorithmic fairness and the need for explainable AI in clinical decision support are crucial for equitable implementation. Successful clinical translation requires addressing workflow integration, validation in real-world settings, and development of approaches suitable for resource-limited environments. This review highlights the transformative potential of AI in stroke care while emphasizing the need for robust clinical validation and equitable deployment to ensure improved patient outcomes across diverse healthcare contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction Following marijuana legalization in several U.S. states, motivations for its use have expanded, especially among marginalized populations. While prior research links marijuana use with disordered eating, little is known about this relationship within sexual minority groups, who are already at elevated risk for body dissatisfaction and unhealthy weight control behaviors. This study examines associations between marijuana use and unhealthy weight control and muscle-enhancing behaviors among sexual minority men in the U.S. Methods We conducted a secondary analysis using data from the Men’s Body Project, a cross-sectional study on body image and health behaviors. The sample included sexual minority men across diverse backgrounds. Logistic regression was used to assess associations between marijuana use and seven behaviors considered risk factors linked to body image concerns: fasting, vomiting, laxative use, diet pill use, muscle-building supplement use, protein powder use, and anabolic steroid use. Results Marijuana users had significantly greater odds of engaging in all measured behaviors. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) ranged from 1.88 (fasting) to 3.12 (diet pill use), all with p -values &lt; 0.001. Other notable associations included vomiting (AOR = 2.61), laxative use (AOR = 2.23), protein powder use (AOR = 2.60), and anabolic steroid use (AOR = 2.62). Conclusion Our results suggest a significant association between marijuana use and elevated odds of engaging in unhealthy weight control and muscle-enhancing behaviors among sexual minority men. Findings highlight the need for tailored public health interventions addressing both substance use and body image within LGBTQ + communities.",

These metrics can mischaracterize complex changes to fire regime attributes because the distributions underlying these attributes are often not well described by parameters. Results We developed a non-parametric index of fire regime departure that quantifies distributional changes to fire regime attributes between time periods using the Earth Mover’s Distance. We used this departure metric to compare fire frequency and burn severity between historical (~1600–1880) and contemporary (1985–2021) time periods in western US forests. In addition, we compared the proposed metrics with a standard suite of measures of central tendency. Departure metrics based on measures of central tendency reported lower relative departures within frequent fire forests and higher relative departures within infrequent fire forests than the EMD-based method. We found that 89% of western US forests are experiencing less frequent and more severe wildfires than historical baselines. Large departures are associated with increased human land-use intensity, and landscapes prioritized by the Wildfire Crisis Mitigation plan are on average, more departed than non-priority landscapes. Conclusions This proposed method captures facets of fire regime departures that metrics based on measures of central tendency cannot. These new metrics can aid the evaluation and targeting of treatments to restore historical fire regimes and manage the resilience of fire-prone landscapes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge in applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning methods aim to recognize new classes from only a few labeled examples. These methods are typically investigated within a standard few-shot learning paradigm, in which all classes in a task are new. However, medical applications, such as pathology classification from chest X-rays, often require learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging the knowledge of previously known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has rarely been investigated in this context. This study presents MetaChest, a large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public databases. It includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating multi-label episodes. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate both the standard transfer learning (TL) approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. The results indicate that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training examples per class improves the classification performance. Notably, the TL approach consistently outperformed the ProtoNet extension, even though it was not specifically tailored for few-shot learning. Furthermore, higher-resolution images improved the accuracy at the cost of additional computation, whereas efficient model architectures achieved performances comparable to larger models with significantly reduced resource requirements.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Precise acetabular cup positioning is critical for the success and longevity of total hip arthroplasty (THA). Robotic-assisted systems enhance placement accuracy, with closed-platform systems being well-established. A pertinent question is whether newer open-platform systems, which offer implant flexibility, achieve comparable accuracy. This study evaluates the radiographic accuracy of a novel, open-platform robotic system (Yuanhua KUNWU) in achieving the planned acetabular component position. Methods A multi-centre retrospective review of 87 consecutive primary robotic THA procedures performed using the KUNWU system was conducted. Pre-operative CT-based planning defined the target acetabular inclination (AI) and anteversion (AV). The primary outcome was the deviation between the planned position and the post-operative CT-measured position. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of cups within the Lewinnek and Callanan safe zones and the accuracy of leg length and offset restoration. Results The mean deviation from the planned position to the post-operative CT was −2.7° for inclination (95% CI: −3.7° to −1.8°, P &lt; 0.001) and 1.0° for anteversion ( P = 0.058). Overall, 80.5% (70/87) of cups were placed within the combined Lewinnek and Callanan safe zones. A significant difference was found in combined offset (mean 2.79 mm, P = 0.002) but not in leg length discrepancy ( P = 0.302). Interobserver reliability was excellent for all measurements. Conclusion The KUNWU open-platform robotic system facilitates accurate and reliable acetabular cup positioning, with minimal deviations from the pre-operative plan and a high rate of placement within the classic safe zones. These results support its use as a precise tool for component positioning in THA.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) plays an essential role in cell cycle regulation, and its dysregulation has been implicated in multiple cancers. Finding harmful CDK4 mutations can help with cancer research and create tailored treatments. The CDK4 gene encodes the protein CDK4, which is a D-type cyclin binding protein that plays a vital role in the cell cycle proceeding from G1 to S phase. Result This study applied numerous computational approaches to explore single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CDK4 . We retrieved the SNPs data of CDK4 from Variation viewer and gnomAD databases for analyzing the variants associated with cancer. With a view to retrieving SNPs data of CDK4 Variation viewer and gnomAD databases were utilized. Twenty-one nsSNPs were found to be the most deleterious or disease causing by utilizing 10 sequence-based web tools to predict the structural and functional annotation of SNPs. We used ConSurf and PROSITE web servers to predict the conservation of the CDK4 protein, which projected all 21 most detrimental nsSNPs belonging to this conserved domain with the ability to disrupt the proteins functionality. The D158Y mutant of CDK4 showed significantly less binding affinity with Cyclin D after the evaluation of molecular docking performed by the HADDOCK 2.4 server. Furthermore, Molecular dynamics simulation studies have shown that the variant may destabilize the protein structure. After examining the effects of potential mutations on post-translational modification sites and protein–protein interactions in the CDK4 protein we found the D158Y (rs2140386429) variant is identified as a potentially crucial CDK4 mutation that may be linked to cancer development based on computational predictions (Fig. 1). Thus, this variant could affect the interactions and structural stability of CDK4, providing possible targets for therapeutic intervention in malignancies driven by CDK4. Conclusion Our extensive computational investigation identifies the D158Y (rs2140386429) variation of CDK4 as a significant mutation that may modify protein structure and function, therefore playing a role in cancer etiology. This finding underscores the importance of this variant as a potential target for therapeutic strategies aimed at malignancies driven by CDK4 dysregulation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction Single site quasi-experimental implementation studies provide opportunities to learn about implementation in context. There is limited guidance on how to best utilise these studies to maximise opportunities for learning at scale. This study evaluated the use of a consensus process to develop and implement standardised perioperative pathways, and aimed to provide practical insights on conducting rigorous, theory-informed evaluations that can generate transferable insights for implementation science. Methods A multi-method quasi-experimental study was conducted in a private hospital in Australia. Six consensus-based surgical care pathways were developed and implemented by different clinical teams, following a four-stage implementation process using the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation and Sustainment (EPIS) framework. Implementation outcomes were explored through participant observations (16 h) and semi-structured interviews ( n = 9), which were analysed thematically using an interpretive descriptive approach. Normalisation Process Theory (NPT) was then applied to understand the mechanisms of change in greater depth. Pathway fidelity was assessed via medical record audits from a random patient sample ( n = 90) from four surgical cohorts. Results Implementing standardised perioperative pathways using a multi-faceted consensus-based implementation plan was perceived as acceptable, appropriate, and feasible. However, fidelity to clinical actions improved in only two of four surgical cohorts. Implementation was operationalised through the four generative mechanisms of NPT and was influenced by factors that related to all four constructs and 12/16 elements of the EPIS framework. Factors relating to the Inner Context and the Innovation were most frequently identified as having a greater influence on implementation across all EPIS phases. The implementation plan targeted Collective Action and Coherence to a greater extent than other mechanisms. Participants linked greater uptake and implementation to the importance of co-designing implementation strategies with frontline staff (improving Legitimation and Coherence) and tailoring strategies to specific disciplines. Conclusions This project provides a practical case study for how to undertake theory-informed, implementation evaluations in real-world contexts. It offers valuable insights for others seeking to operationalise implementation science principles in everyday healthcare settings including how individual strategies may work to drive local change.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Hyperspectral imaging acquires spatially resolved spectral signatures, enabling a wide range of applications from scientific research to industrial processes. Traditional microelectron-mechanical systems (MEMS) Fabry–Pérot (FP) spectrometers offer a compact and simple design but are limited by single free spectral range (FSR) operation. This limitation introduces a fundamental trade-off: achieving high spectral resolution necessitates narrowing the operational bandwidth. Furthermore, maintaining such high resolution demands a larger number of sampling channels, which increases the acquisition time for a single hyperspectral image and thereby limits the frame rate. Here, we present a computational hyperspectral imaging framework that achieves broadband spectral coverage and high frame rate without sacrificing spectral resolution. By dynamically modulating the MEMS-FP cavity to span multiple FSRs, we generate a set of low-correlation spectral sampling patterns as spectral encoders. When combined with a tailored reconstruction algorithm, the system accurately decodes spectral information from a significantly reduced number of sampling channels. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our system through LED array inspection, demonstrating its potential for high-throughput defect detection in LEDs or screen manufacturing lines. Our work presents a strategy that leverages rapidly advancing computational techniques to overcome the limitations of conventional hardware architectures in hyperspectral imaging. This compact and integrable solution is particularly well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Although canine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow, adipose tissue, and umbilical cord share similar characteristics, the invasive nature of obtaining these tissues through surgical procedures can lead to health complications. Electroacupuncture (EA), a non-invasive alternative method, has been successfully used to stimulate MSC mobilization in horses and rats. However, there is limited information on EA in dogs. Methods MSC mobilization was induced in healthy dogs using EA. Specific acupuncture sites, including GV4 + GV6, SP10 + GB39, and SP10 + LR3 were stimulated in four dogs once a week for 3 weeks. Blood samples were collected for peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) isolation and culture. Peripheral blood stem cells derived following EA (EA-PBSCs) were characterized and compared with adipose-derived MSCs (AD-MSCs). Results EA-PBSCs adhered to the culture dish surface and exhibited a fibroblast-like morphology similar to that of AD-MSCs. The proliferation rate of EA-PBSCs was substantially lower than that of AD-MSCs ( P &lt; 0.05). Flow cytometry indicated that EA-PBSCs expressed CD34 and CD90 but lacked CD44 and MHC II expression. Moreover, EA-PBSCs showed osteogenic and chondrogenic abilities but not adipogenic differentiation. EA-PBSCs and AD-MSCs exhibited downregulation of immunomodulatory genes, such as interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ), IL10 , prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ), hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO ), after priming with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). Conclusion This study provides promising preliminary insights into the feasibility of isolating EA-PBSCs in dogs. The distinct immunophenotype observed, CD34⁺ with low CD44 and MHC II, suggests that these cells may represent an earlier progenitor or a tissue-specific stem-like population rather than a typical MSC. Further study with refined isolation methods and more donors will be important to confirm these findings and elucidate the nature of these cells. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Medical Education Units (MEUs) provide centralized management of curriculum development, faculty training, assessment, and quality assurance. In Korean Medicine schools, MEUs have been established per accreditation standards to support curriculum planning, quality improvement, and innovative pedagogy. However, challenges persist in governance, personnel, funding, and balancing research and service functions, with stakeholder perceptions varying by background and role, highlighting the need for systematic empirical investigation. Methods An exploratory cross-sectional survey was conducted among faculty from 12 Korean medicine institutions. Participants rated education unit roles, prioritized tasks across necessity, urgency, and importance, and evaluated operational barriers and support needs. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Plackett–Luce ranking models, and group comparisons ( t tests, ANOVA, Mann–Whitney U , and Kruskal–Wallis). Results Eighty-two faculty from 12 Korean medicine institutions participated. Curriculum management and quality improvement were rated as top priorities, while student assessment consistently ranked lowest. Significant between-field differences emerged in curriculum management, faculty development, and program evaluation perceptions. Personnel shortages, lack of interest, and limited awareness were identified as major operational barriers. Support needs prioritized personnel and budget, whereas feasibility favored budget and policy support, highlighting a mismatch between most-needed resources and those most attainable for education unit operations. Conclusions Korean medicine education units play a central role in curriculum management and quality improvement, yet operational effectiveness is constrained by personnel shortages and resource misalignment. Targeted support for staffing and strategic resource allocation is essential to enhance their functional capacity and fulfill accreditation-driven educational objectives.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Acute liver injury (ALI) is a severe hepatic condition with high mortality and few therapeutic options aside from liver transplantation. Lonicera japonica Flos (LJ), a traditional herbal medicine, has been reported to have anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activities; however, the underlying mechanisms remain insufficiently clarified. Methods In this study, an integrative approach was used to investigate the effects of LJ on liver injury by combining network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental validation. Computational analyses were used to predict the potential targets and enriched pathways of LJ-derived active compounds on ALI. These predictions were subsequently validated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced ALI murine models and LPS-stimulated HepG2 cells through biochemical assays and histological staining with evaluation of HIF-1α/IL-1β signaling pathway-related molecules. Results Network pharmacology highlighted that the HIF-1 signaling pathway is closely related to the potential mechanism of LJ on ALI. In silico docking demonstrated that loganin and loganic acid, main components of LJ, have potentially strong binding affinities on HIF-1α. Based on these predicted results, LJ lowered serum AST and ALT, alleviated histopathological injury, and suppressed hepatic TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β expression in LPS-induced ALI mice. In HepG2 cells, LJ inhibited cleaved IL-1β and HIF-1α protein expression without cytotoxicity in response to LPS, thereby dampening multiple inflammatory cascades. Conclusion Overall, LJ exerts hepatoprotective effects against LPS-induced ALI by targeting several interconnected pathways. These findings support LJ as a potential therapeutic candidate for inflammatory liver disease and demonstrate the value of combining computational prediction with experimental confirmation to investigate traditional herbal medicines.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Studies have shown strong relationships between the presence of kin and children's survival outcomes in historical and contemporary low-income contexts. However, this relationship has never been studied among an enslaved population, who encountered extremely harsh living conditions. Examining this relationship among different populations may reveal similarities and differences across contexts. The present study addresses this gap by examining the life courses of children born between 1830 and 1863 and enslaved in Suriname (n = 19,095 children) and their mothers. For the period 1848‒1863, we can also observe matrilineal kin, including grandmothers, aunts, and uncles (n = 12,020 children). The relationships of matrilineal kin's presence and children's hazard of death from ages 6 months to 12 years were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards models. Experiencing maternal death was related to an increased hazard of death for children throughout childhood, but particularly during infancy (ages 6 months to 1 year; hazard ratio: 6.24, 95% confidence interval: 3.34‒11.66), and it decreased as children aged. The presence of grandmothers was related to a decreased hazard of death among children aged 1‒5, and the presence of aunts and uncles was beneficial to survival for children aged 5‒12. Mothers were especially important to children's survival, particularly during infancy, likely due to the importance of maternal care and breastfeeding on survival. During childhood, however, it appears that the presence of extended kin was also important, implying that children's care could have been provided by other family members once children were weaned. These findings closely align with those of other studies and reflect the importance of extended kin networks on childhood survival across time and space.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This research note discusses one underexplored aspect of the study of polygyny, namely, the extent to which the practice remains viable from a purely demographic standpoint. Using data from the United Nations World Population Prospects 2022 covering 48 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), I evaluate a simple indicator—gamma—for capturing the “demographic potential” of polygyny, that is, the fraction of men who can have two wives with no other man pushed out of the marriage market. I estimate how this indicator has evolved between 1950 and 2021 across regions of SSA and show how the measure correlates with polygyny estimates from available men's and women's Demographic and Health Surveys. Gamma shows inverted U-curve patterns aligned with stages of the demographic transition, from modestly low levels to high levels during periods of rapid population growth and then declining again. Recent declines are starkest in South SSA, while potential remains moderate elsewhere. Gamma correlates positively with polygyny estimates from Demographic and Health Surveys—particularly in Central and South SSA—and can explain up to 50‒70% variation in polygyny, albeit not everywhere.

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Racial/ethnic disparities in health literacy, self-perception of health status, and barriers to care access have been described for many disease processes. However, few studies have characterized these factors in patients with Chiari malformation type I (CM-1). METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of data from the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program. Adults with CM-1 were identified through International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision and 10th revision diagnostic codes and stratified by race/ethnicity: non-Hispanic White (NHW), non-Hispanic Black or African American, and Hispanic or Latino (HL). Patient demographics and socioeconomic status were examined. Group-level differences in survey-reported baseline health status, health perceptions, health literacy, and perceived barriers to care were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 966 patients identified, 552 (57.1%) were NHW, 225 (23.3%) were non-Hispanic Black, and 189 (19.6%) were HL. Socioeconomic status varied between strata, with the highest education level, income level, employment, retirement, marital status, and home ownership reported by NHW patients ( P &lt; .001 for all). Average pain was highest among HL patients, as well as proportions of best and worst general health status (all P &lt; .001). The NHW cohort was able to accomplish more of their everyday activities than the other cohorts ( P = .003). The worst general mental health ( P = .015), general physical health ( P = .004), and general quality of life ( P &lt; .001) were reported by HL patients. The HL cohort had the highest rates of difficulty in understanding information, required health material assistance, and had low medical form confidence ( P &lt; .001 for all). Furthermore, difficulties affording follow-up care ( P = .041), concerns about payment ( P = .033), and transportation-related delays in care ( P = .002) were most common in the HL cohort. CONCLUSION: The results of our study indicate racial/ethnic disparities in CM-1 patients' perception of their health, health literacy, and access to care.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite its clinical utility and consistent procedural volume, Medicare reimbursement for anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has undergone policy-driven changes over the past decade. This study investigated longitudinal Medicare reimbursement trends for ACDF among orthopedic and neurological spine surgeons from 2013 to 2023. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed using publicly available Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services databases. Surgeons who billed ≥10 ACDF procedures (current procedural terminology 22551) per year were included. Provider demographics, procedural volumes, average Medicare standardized amount (AMSA), inflation-adjusted AMSA, and average annual procedural income (API) were analyzed. Comparisons were made by surgical subspecialty by year. RESULTS: A total of 10 311 spine surgeons performed 187 062 ACDF procedures between 2013 and 2023. Neurosurgeons comprised 65% of providers and procedures, while orthopedic surgeons comprised 35%. Average annual case volumes were similar across specialties. Between 2013 and 2023, inflation-adjusted AMSA declined 23% and API declined 27%, despite stable procedural volumes. These declines were consistent across neurosurgeons (−23% AMSA, −27% API) and orthopedic surgeons (−22% AMSA, −27% API). The number of neurosurgeons performing ACDF decreased over the study period (17% decrease), while the number of orthopedic surgeons increased (31% increase). Both specialties saw a reduction in average procedures per provider. CONCLUSION: While unadjusted Medicare reimbursement for ACDF remained stable from 2013 to 2023, inflation-adjusted reimbursement declined substantially, reflecting an erosion in surgeon compensation. These findings raise concerns about the financial sustainability of providing ACDF services in the Medicare population and underscore the need for policy strategies that protect access to surgical care for an aging population.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Correct development of the testis serves as a springboard for male fertility in adult life, yet our understanding of the timing of human Sertoli and germ cell maturation and their dynamics is incomplete. To map the developmental timeline of germ cells and Sertoli cells, we analysed an extensive set of human foetal and prepubertal testicular samples [n=48, spanning from 7 post conception weeks (PCW) to 13.5 years of age]. Octamer binding transcription factor (OCT)3/4+ gonocytes were identified as the main source of proliferative germ cells during foetal development, while melanoma associated antigen (MAGE)-A4+ (pre)spermatogonia divided at a slow rate both in utero and during childhood. In samples aged between 4 and 10 years, anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) expression is reduced and androgen receptor (AR) expression is increased, consistent with maturation of testicular Sertoli cells. Sertoli cell proliferation peaked at 2-2.5 years and gradually declined through early childhood, becoming minimal from the age of 6, coinciding with lumen formation. These data suggest that Sertoli cell maturation precedes the initiation of spermatogenesis well before the start of puberty. Ultimately, this human testicular developmental timeline serves as a reference for the development of in vitro gametogenesis models and paves the way for fertility preservation and restoration for those at risk of infertility.",

    "Abstract": "While DIS3 functions in male germ cells are emerging, its ribonuclease activity governing Sertoli cell RNA metabolism, essential for testicular development and spermatogenesis, remains undefined. This study identifies a critical role for exosome-associated DIS3 ribonuclease in regulating Sertoli cell maintenance and maturation during spermatogenesis. Dis3 deficiency in Sertoli cells causes severe testicular atrophy, marked by rapid depletion of both Sertoli and germ cells. This phenotype results from impaired Sertoli cell proliferation, elevated apoptosis, disrupted maturation, and compromised blood-testis barrier integrity, culminating in defective spermatogenesis and infertility. scRNA-seq analysis reveals altered cell-cell communication, alongside heightened p53 and Wnt signaling activity in Dis3 cKO Sertoli cells. p53 inhibitor treatment mitigates overt apoptosis in Dis3 cKO Sertoli cells. Similarly, inhibition of the Wnt/β-Catenin pathway increases the abundance of both Sertoli and germ cells while improving Sertoli cell maturation. Together, these findings establish Sertoli cell-specific DIS3 as essential for testicular development and spermatogenesis in mice, and implicate the p53 and Wnt/β-Catenin pathways as potential mechanistic contributors.",

    "Abstract": "Polyphosphates are evolutionarily conserved anionic polymers mediating pleiotropic functions in eukaryotes and prokaryotes, depending on their chain-length. Bacteria typically synthetize long-chains, while human platelets harbour exclusively medium-chains. Polyphosphate-mediated lung and liver-injury have been reported in experimental mouse models but their effects on the kidney remain undefined. Here we assessed kidney histopathology and cytokine levels following intravenous administration of medium-chain (P100) and long-chain (P700) polyphosphates and their synergistic effects with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in mice. We found that P700 induced albuminuria, renal Kim-1 and Lcn2 transcription, focal renal damage with glomerular microthrombi, tubular degeneration, granular phenotype of slit diaphragm components nephrin and ZO1, and enlarged electron dense vesicles in podocyte cytoplasm indicating lysosome swelling. P700 combined with LPS induced marked multifocal acute tubular necrosis in the cortex, and augmented LPS-induced proinflammatory cytokine levels. No notable effects were seen with P100, indicating that PolyP-mediated kidney injury development is dependent on chain-length. We conclude that long-chain polyphosphates may play a procoagulant role in kidney injury development, by inducing microthrombi characteristic of thrombotic microangiopathy and augmenting cytokine levels under inflammatory conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells circulate between the blood, bone marrow (BM), and lymphoid organs, where interactions with the lymph node (LN) microenvironment enhance their survival, proliferation, and drug resistance. Most in vitro models fail to reproduce the spatial and cellular complexity of the LN niche, limiting studies of tissue-specific drug responses. To address this, we developed a 3D LN model using a gelatine scaffold and a clinorotator bioreactor previously validated for a BM system. The scaffold was seeded with human lymphatic fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which deposited extracellular matrix and supported patient-derived CLL cell viability and proliferation. Consistent with in vivo observations, CLL cells within the scaffold downregulated the chemokine receptor CXCR4, further reduced upon proliferative stimulation. Final validation involved treatment with targeted therapies: the Bcl-2 antagonist venetoclax and the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib. Venetoclax treatment revealed greater CLL protection within the LN environment than in BM, whereas ibrutinib's mobilizing effect was comparable. This 3D LN model offers an effective ex vivo platform for studying microenvironment–tumour interactions and tissue-specific drug responses.",

    "Abstract": "<ns3:p>The transition toward greener economies has heightened the need for education systems to cultivate green skills from early schooling through vocational pathways. Despite growing interest, existing assessments remain fragmented and lack validation across educational levels. This study develops and validates a unified measurement framework for assessing green skills implementation across basic, lower-secondary, and vocational education. A multi-phase quantitative design was employed, including item development, expert review, exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, and multi-group measurement invariance testing. The final instrument comprised 36 items across six constructs: environmental awareness, sustainable behaviour, critical sustainability thinking, sustainability participation, resource management skills, and technical green practices. Using data from 215 students, the six-factor CFA model demonstrated excellent fit (CFI = .953; RMSEA = .052) and strong reliability and convergent validity across all constructs. Multi-group CFA supported configural and metric invariance, while partial scalar invariance was achieved after freeing four intercepts, enabling valid latent mean comparisons across educational levels. Results indicated a clear developmental progression of green skills, with foundational competencies stronger in primary education and technical competencies highest in vocational students. These findings confirm that green skills evolve along a continuum and can be measured consistently across schooling stages. The validated framework provides a robust tool for curriculum alignment, professional development, and monitoring sustainability competencies within national education systems. This study advances psychometric approaches in sustainability education and offers empirical guidance for policymakers seeking coherent strategies to support future green workforces.</ns3:p>",

    "Abstract": "<ns3:p>This review summarizes current knowledge on both the most used photoinitiator system in dental resin (camphorquinone) and the alternative photoinitiator systems employed in dentistry. The review focuses on polymerization mechanisms, in vitro evaluation techniques, and factors that influence the degree of conversion and hardness of dental resin-based materials. A comprehensive electronic literature search was performed using PubMed, Google Scholar, and Elsevier databases, covering publications from 1984 to 2025. More than 30 articles were selected based on their relevance to the scope of this review. Light-activated dental resin-based composites (RBCs) represent the most widely used restorative materials in clinical practice. However, effective polymerization of each photoinitiator system depends on the use of a compatible light-curing unit with an appropriate emission spectrum. Changes in the photoinitiator system can markedly affect the biomechanical properties of dental resins, including degree of conversion, hardness, and biocompatibility. This review provides a comparative analysis of RBCs formulated with different photoinitiators, such as camphorquinone, benzophenone, 1-phenyl-1,2-propanedione, trimethylbenzoyl-diphenylphosphine oxide, and benzoyl peroxide. The main objective of this article was to highlight alternative photoinitiators capable of overcoming the color drawbacks of camphorquinone, particularly yellow discoloration, while maintaining comparable mechanical performance. Although current evidence suggests that no alternative photoinitiator fully matches the effectiveness of camphorquinone, certain systems—such as benzoyl germanium derivatives and novel acylphosphine oxide photoinitiators used in combination with camphorquinone—appear promising for enhancing esthetic properties and increasing the degree of conversion of dental RBCs.</ns3:p>",

    "Abstract": "<ns3:p> Purpose This study aimed to investigate the effect of gender on balance performance among physically active young adults by analyzing anterior, posterior, and central stability tendencies. While balance is a multifactorial ability influenced by sensory integration and neuromuscular coordination, evidence regarding gender-specific postural strategies remains inconsistent. Methods Fifty-two healthy participants (26 males and 26 females, aged 18–25 years) who engaged in regular exercise were assessed using the Sigma Balance System (CosmoGamma, Italy). Balance performance was evaluated through a dynamic limit of stability test, and the percentage of time spent in anterior, posterior, and central zones was calculated. Independent samples t-tests and Welch’s t-tests were applied depending on variance homogeneity, with a significance level of p&lt;.05. Results No significant gender differences were observed in anterior or posterior sway tendencies (p&gt;.05). However, females demonstrated significantly higher centering performance than males (p=.0246, R <ns3:sup>2</ns3:sup> =.1477), indicating a moderate effect size. These findings suggest that although the general mechanisms of postural control are similar across genders, central stability strategies differ, potentially reflecting distinct neuromotor adaptations. Conclusion The results highlight that females employ more precise neuromuscular control to maintain balance within the central stability zone. This advantage may offer performance benefits in sports requiring static or semi-dynamic postures, while emphasizing the need for gender-specific balance training and rehabilitation approaches. Overall, the study contributes to understanding how gender-related biomechanical and neuromotor factors shape postural control among physically active young adults. </ns3:p>",

    "Abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by less treatment responsiveness and poorer prognosis than other breast cancer subtypes. The introduction of anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy has expanded the therapeutic options beyond conventional chemotherapy, leading to the adoption of pembrolizumab-based regimens in both adjuvant and first-line palliative settings. However, in contrast to other tumor types that respond robustly to immune checkpoint inhibitors, the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in TNBC remains modest. Multiple factors contribute to this limited response, including the heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression, presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment regulated by complex immunomodulatory pathways, differences in mutational burden and neoantigen presentation, quantity and functional exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and variable synergy with combination partners. Numerous combination strategies have been actively investigated to enhance immunotherapeutic efficacy. Among these, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) have shown the most promising results. The phase III ASCENT-04/KEYNOTE-D19 trial demonstrated that the combination of sacituzumab govitecan and pembrolizumab significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with PD-L1-positive metastatic TNBC, establishing this regimen as a potential new first-line standard, pending guideline adoption. Although the overall survival data are still immature, the trend appears to be favorable. Other ADCs are being explored in early phase studies, and targeted therapies such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and protein kinase B inhibitors have also shown preliminary activity in smaller trials. Further refinement of these strategies through biomarker-driven, large-scale studies is warranted to identify the most effective combinations and to improve outcomes in patients with TNBC.",

    "Abstract": "Aims The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of combined preoperative benzoyl peroxide application and subcutaneous povidone-iodine (PV-I) disinfection, in addition to standard PV-I disinfection of the skin, on intraoperative cultures of Cutibacterium acnes . Methods All patients undergoing arthroscopic or open shoulder surgery were eligible for inclusion. Patients were randomized into one of three groups: control (standard disinfection of the skin with PV-I), double prevention (disinfection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue with PV-I after incision for 60 seconds), and triple prevention (application of benzoyl peroxide during the three days before surgery, disinfection of the skin with PV-I, and disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue with PV-I after incision for 60 seconds). Cultures were taken of the tissue layers, equipment, and the surgeon’s gloves. A sample size of 156 patients was calculated. Culture positivity was compared between the groups, with the intra-articular and deep muscular culture as the primary outcome. Results A total of 156 patients (median age 58 years (IQR 20 to 85), with 61 patients (39%) being female) were included. The intra-articular cultures were positive in 16 patients (32%) in the control group, 11 (21%) in the double prevention group, and five (10%) in the triple prevention group (p = 0.031). C. acnes presence in the muscular layer was 21 (42%) in the control group, 17 (33%) in the double prevention group, and seven (13%) in the triple prevention group (p = 0.0052). The median number of positive cultures was one in the control group (IQR 0 to 5), one in the double prevention group (IQR 0 to 3.75), and zero in the triple prevention group (IQR 0 to 2; p = 0.082). Conclusion Combining disinfection of the subcutaneous tissue after incision with preoperative application of benzoyl peroxide reduced the presence of C. acnes during surgery.

    "Abstract": "Aims Fragility distal femur fractures have comparable mortality outcomes to fragility hip fractures. Increasing scrutiny is being placed on the perioperative management of these injuries to improve mortality and morbidity outcomes. A key pillar of preoperative consent is the explanation of adverse events associated with the underlying pathology and/or suggested treatment course. The Nottingham Hip Fracture Score (NHFS) is a validated tool used to predict mortality after a fragility hip fracture and has been shown to be predictive of mortality after fragility odontoid peg fractures. This study aims to assess the utility of the NHFS in predicting 30-day and one-year mortality after distal femur fragility fractures. Methods A retrospective cohort study of all consecutive fragility distal femur fractures treated surgically over an 86-month period at six units managing acute fragility fractures was performed. NHFS were calculated, with 30-day and one-year mortality ascertained from local hospital and primary care records. Patients were grouped as ‘high-risk’ of mortality with a NHFS &gt; 5. Results Overall, 30-day mortality was 7.1% in the high-risk cohort (16/225), with no deaths identified in the low-risk cohort. Across both groups one-year mortality rate was 24.9%, with a 6.4% one-year mortality in the low-risk cohort (10/157) compared with 37.8% (85/225) in the high-risk cohort. Area under the curve analysis of receiver operator characteristic curves for 30-day mortality was 0.854 and 0.779 for one-year mortality. This demonstrated excellent predictive power at 30 days, diminishing slightly at one year. Conclusion The NHFS is an excellent predictor of 30-day mortality with reliability reducing at one year. A NHFS of 5 or more is associated with a deleterious outcome and can be used to inform discussions with patients and/or relatives regarding adverse outcomes. It can also identify patients with high mortality risk allowing for modifiable risk factors such as time to theatre to be further optimized. Cite this article: Bone Jt Open 2026;7(2):169–176.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: US guidelines recommend surveillance colonoscopy following polyp removal, but stool testing may offer a more efficient, acceptable strategy for patients with non-advanced lesions. We conducted exploratory analyses to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative FIT results to diagnose advanced colorectal neoplasia (ACN) in patients undergoing surveillance colonoscopy. Methods: We classified patients by prior colonoscopy findings as having low, intermediate, or high risk polyps. We compared the diagnostic performance for detecting ACN at an optimal cutoff identified by the Youden index versus the standard cutoff of 100 ng/mL. We also estimated cumulative sensitivity and specificity for serial FIT testing in patients with non-advanced findings. Results: Among the 449 participants (mean ± SD age 65.4 ±7.1, 53.2% female, and 92.7% white), the median interval between colonoscopies was 5.0 years (IQR 3.5, 5.6); adequate or better bowel prep was achieved in 89.3% and cecal intubation in 98.4%. We detected 55 advanced-precancerous lesions (APL), but no cancers. For patients with prior non-advanced lesions (n = 378), the optimal cutoff was 26 ng/mL. Compared with the standard cutoff, the optimal cutoff increased sensitivity (14.3% to 35.7%, p &lt;0.01) but reduced specificity (95.5% to 79.2%, p &lt;0.01). Estimated cumulative sensitivity across 3 rounds of FIT testing was 73.4% at the optimal cutoff versus 37.1% with the standard cutoff. Conclusions: Lowering the FIT hemoglobin cutoff markedly improved sensitivity for detecting APL in patients without prior advanced polyps. Serial testing could further enhance detection. FIT-based surveillance should be further evaluated as a potential strategy to prioritize, delay, or replace colonoscopy.",

    "Abstract": "Background Age at puberty determines timing of pubertal growth spurt. Whether the intensity of the peri-pubertal growth velocity is also affected by pubertal timing in boys remains to be elucidated. Objective To study changes in growth velocity in relation to pubertal timing, Insulin-like Growth Factor-I (IGF-I) and fasting insulin in healthy boys. Design, setting and participant Longitudinal study with biannual assessment of testicular volume (TV), growth velocity, IGF-I and fasting insulin levels. Peak height velocity (PHV) was calculated. 105 boys (947 examinations) were included. Pubertal onset was available in 62 boys – the rest remained prepubertal throughout the study period or were in puberty at baseline. Results Age at pubertal onset (TV &gt; 3 ml) was negatively correlated with PHV (ρ = -0.48; p &lt; 0.001). The early (age of onset &lt; 33,3 percentile) tertile of maturing boys had significantly higher growth velocity (mean Δ 0.48 (0.14 – 0.82) cm/year; p &lt; 0.006) than late maturing boys (&gt; 66,7 percentile) over the 6 years peri-pubertal period. However, the late maturing boys remained significantly taller throughout the study (p &lt; 0.05). IGF-I levels were similar between the 3 groups of boys. In all boys, the increase in growth velocity was associated with a larger increase in IGF-I (p &lt; 0.001) during the first 2 years of puberty. Conclusion Early maturation was associated with increased growth velocity and PHV in healthy boys. However, it was not sufficient to compensate for the shorter total growth period. IGF-I was positively associated with growth velocity.",

    "Abstract": "Objective CT attenuation value is useful in the differential diagnosis of adrenal masses, and values &lt; 10 Hounsfield units (HU) can exclude malignancy and pheochromocytoma. However, few reports have examined the reliability of CT attenuation measurements. We examined the reliability of CT attenuation measurements made by surgeons not specialized in image reading. Design A retrospective analysis of 313 patients (325 lesions) who underwent surgery at a single institution was performed. Methods One general surgeon and one endocrine surgeon independently measured CT attenuation values. The intraclass correlation coefficient and Cohen’s kappa coefficient were used to analyze interobserver reliability. All cases were subjected for endocrine function tests, and histopathologically diagnosed. Additional analyses included segmented regression for size-related measurement variability and multivariable analyses comparing aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs) and cortisol-producing adenomas (CPAs). Results The intraclass correlation coefficient between observers was 0.938 (95%CI, 0.923-0.949) and Cohen’s kappa coefficient was 0.851 (95%CI, 0.781-0.922). Both observers measured all malignant adrenal tumors (such as adrenocortical carcinoma, metastatic adrenal carcinoma, and malignant lymphoma) and pheochromocytomas as ≥ 10 HU. CT attenuation values were significantly higher in CPAs than in APAs, independent of mass size (p &lt; 0.001 for both observers). Conclusions CT attenuation value was shown to be reliable enough for simple measurements that could be performed by non-radiologists and was useful for excluding malignancy and pheochromocytoma. Significance statement This study reinforced evidence for the reliability of CT attenuation value. Even with a simple method that can be performed by non-radiologists, CT attenuation values were highly reliable and useful for excluding malignancy and pheochromocytoma. In addition, all lesions in this study were evaluated both endocrinologically and pathologically, giving high validity to the reference standard. These findings complement and further substantiate the latest clinical practice guidelines of the European Society of Endocrinology.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study aimed to investigate the association between fasting glucagon levels and the risk of comorbid stroke in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods This study included 1,745 T2DM patients hospitalized at Tianjin Medical University General Hospital from September 1, 2022, to September 30, 2025. Patients were divided into a T2DM group and a T2DM with stroke group based on the presence of stroke. Fasting glucagon levels and other clinical data were collected. Binary logistic regression models were used to analyze the relationship between fasting glucagon and stroke risk. Results Among female T2DM patients, fasting glucagon levels were significantly higher in the T2DM with stroke group compared to the T2DM group (13.38 vs. 11.56 pmol/L, P=0.011). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for multiple confounding factors, including age, diabetes duration, BMI, hypertension, eGFR, HbA1c, dyslipidemia, and medication use, higher fasting glucagon levels are independently associated with the presence of comorbid stroke in female T2DM patients (Model 3: Q4 vs. Q1: OR = 2.396, 95% CI: 1.075–5.339, P=0.037). Additionally, the prevalence of stroke increased with ascending quartiles of glucagon levels in female patients (P=0.023). However, no significant association was observed between fasting glucagon levels and stroke risk in male patients. Conclusion This study demonstrates that among hospitalized female patients with T2DM, higher fasting glucagon levels are independently associated with the presence of comorbid stroke. This association suggests a potential link between glucagon and cerebrovascular disease in this population, warranting further investigation to explore its role.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The detection of incipient and minor cracks in prestressed reinforced concrete (RC) structures is crucial in ensuring safety of existing bridges. However, traditional structural health monitoring (SHM) often fails to provide reliable and effective early detection. As a matter of fact, literature SHM applications typically investigated moderate-to-severe cracking conditions and often developed criteria that are likely to depend on investigated scenarios. Aiming at addressing the abovementioned literature gap, this study evaluates the effectiveness of acoustic emission (AE) testing for early crack identification in post-tensioned RC girders. AE tests are carried out during cyclic and monotonic four-point bending tests on different specimens up to failure. Multiple AE analysis methods are systematically implemented considering literature methods and novel method specifications (MSs). The evolution of key AE features is examined, and several indicators are further analyzed through a blind assessment framework. The complete AE dataset of AE data is made publicly available. AE activity trends and their potential correlation with observed mechanical damage are identified and discussed. Among the investigated indicators, relative acoustic entropy shows particular promise for early crack detection. The study systematically compares the application of multiple assessment methods, identifying strengths and weaknesses and outlining potential SHM criteria. The findings demonstrate that AE testing, when combined with suitable MSs and damage criteria, offers a viable path for reliable SHM. This paper lays the groundwork for development of robust damage detection criteria.",

    "Abstract": "The article presents the results of a study on the formation and evolution of the global research field devoted to urban soils between 1995 and 2024. A database comprising 961 scientific articles published during this period was compiled and subjected to a detailed bibliometric analysis. The analysis included an assessment of the temporal dynamics of publication output, the identification of the most frequently publishing journals and countries with the highest research activity, an examination of international collaboration patterns, and the distribution of publication languages. The core part of the study involved an analysis of keyword co-occurrence in the collected literature. Based on these data, a network model was constructed to represent the variability and interconnections among keywords. Analytical methods derived from mathematical graph theory were applied to characterize complex network structures in terms of their coherence, vertex degree distribution, and the extraction of so-called p-layers. To isolate these layers, an original graph-layering technique was proposed, enabling a multilevel interpretation of relationships and hierarchies within the analysed network. The keyword co-occurrence analysis revealed that the development of urban soil research can be divided into two distinct phases. The first phase (1995–2010) represents the emergence of research awareness, while the second (2011–2024) corresponds to a “developmental” stage characterized by the expansion and deepening of knowledge about urban soils. Furthermore, the results indicate that research in this field has revolved around a limited number of central concepts (Urban Soil, Heavy Metals, Biochar), which serve as semantic reference points within the scientific discourse. The established prominence of these keywords positions them as enduring thematic anchors in a still relatively young yet dynamically developing research domain, which continues to evolve in parallel with growing public awareness of the importance of the urban environment.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores the experiences of women survivors of the 1965 human rights violations in Indonesia, highlighting how they navigate stigma, reconstruct memory, and assert solidarity within the politics of memory shaped by the New Order regime. Dominant historiographies of 1965 have centered largely on male perspectives, marginalizing women’s voices and erasing their experiences of sexualized and ideological violence. Drawing on oral histories, autobiographical accounts, and field interviews conducted since 2018, this research foregrounds the narratives of women affiliated with Gerwani and other leftist organizations, who endured stigmatization as immoral or atheistic while confronting mass violence. Integrating theories of political memory (Ricoeur) and sexual politics (Kate Millett), the study examines the intersection of gender, ideology, and religion in shaping both oppression and resistance. Findings indicate that women survivors employ religious practice, community networks, and feminist-informed activism to reclaim agency over their bodies and histories. These strategies of remembrance and solidarity not only challenge the hegemonic narratives imposed by the New Order but also construct alternative frameworks for understanding collective trauma. By centering women’s lived experiences, this study contributes to Southeast Asian gendered memory studies, feminist historiography, and post-conflict social justice discourse. It demonstrates that memory work is both a site of historical reckoning and a medium of empowerment, where women survivors of 1965 transform experiences of stigma into solidarity and resilience, reshaping how Indonesian society can engage with past violence. [Este estudio explora las experiencias de mujeres supervivientes de las violaciones de derechos humanos de 1965 en Indonesia, destacando cómo negocian el estigma, reconstruyen la memoria y afirman la solidaridad dentro de la política de la memoria configurada por el régimen del Nuevo Orden. Las historiografías dominantes sobre 1965 se han centrado en gran medida en perspectivas masculinas, marginando las voces de las mujeres y borrando sus experiencias de violencia sexualizada e ideológica. A partir de historias orales, relatos autobiográficos y entrevistas de campo realizadas desde 2018, esta investigación sitúa en primer plano las narrativas de mujeres vinculadas a Gerwani y a otras organizaciones de izquierda que padecieron la estigmatización como inmorales o ateas mientras enfrentaban la violencia masiva. Integrando teorías de la memoria política (Ricoeur) y de la política sexual (Kate Millett), el estudio examina la intersección entre género, ideología y religión en la configuración tanto de la opresión como de la resistencia. Los resultados indican que las mujeres supervivientes recurren a la práctica religiosa, a redes comunitarias y a un activismo informado por el feminismo para recuperar la agencia sobre sus cuerpos y sus historias. Estas estrategias de memoria y solidaridad no solo cuestionan las narrativas hegemónicas impuestas por el Nuevo Orden, sino que también construyen marcos alternativos para comprender el trauma colectivo. Al situar en el centro las experiencias vividas de las mujeres, este estudio contribuye a los estudios de la memoria con perspectiva de género en el Sudeste Asiático, a la historiografía feminista y al discurso de la justicia social en contextos posconflicto. Demuestra que el trabajo de la memoria es a la vez un espacio de ajuste de cuentas histórico y un medio de empoderamiento, en el que las mujeres supervivientes de 1965 transforman experiencias de estigma en solidaridad y resiliencia, reconfigurando las formas en que la sociedad indonesia puede relacionarse con la violencia del pasado].",

    "Abstract": "This study examines how Fox News and CTV News presented the 2025 tariffs on Canadian imports by US President Donald Trump. Using Entman’s four framing functions and Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis (CDA), the article explores how each media outlet defined the trade conflict, attributed causality, rendered moral judgments, and suggested policy responses. Drawing from fifty-two articles from Fox News and fifty-two articles from CTV News published between January 20 and April 30, 2025, the research employed a qualitative comparative research design that integrates framing analysis with textual-level CDA. This dual-method approach enabled the identification of both surface-level narrative structures and deeper ideological mechanisms embedded in discourse. The findings reveal two sharply divergent media narratives. Fox News framed the tariffs as a moral defense against a national security threat, emphasizing American sovereignty, victimhood, and executive resolve. CTV News portrayed the tariffs as politically motivated and economically harmful, and emphasized diplomatic norms, institutional responses, and measured retaliation. The study contributes to the literature by demonstrating how media framing not only shapes public understanding of trade conflicts but also reinforces divergent national identities, political ideologies, and economic nationalism.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores the role of metaphor in shaping subjective worldviews in the works of Oksana Zabuzhko and Virginia Woolf, focusing on how metaphors influence artistic world-building and reader interaction. The research employs structural and semantic analysis, cognitive linguistics, and comparative studies to identify key metaphorical models in both authors’ works. The findings reveal that Woolf uses metaphor to express fragmented consciousness, psychological states, and time, while Zabuzhko’s metaphors address national identity, feminist discourse, and social criticism. Woolf’s metaphors primarily serve expressive-emotional and cognitive functions, whereas Zabuzhko’s often carry ideological and polemical weight. The study underscores metaphor as a vital tool in constructing artistic reality and enhancing reader engagement. It also highlights the importance of further research into the cognitive mechanisms of metaphor and its role in text comprehension. The study’s practical value lies in its potential to deepen the understanding of literary texts, improve literary analysis methods, and enhance the interpretation of metaphor in teaching literature and cultural studies.",

The data were obtained using a 190~GeV negative pion beam scattered off transversely polarised NH$_3$ target. The analysis introduces a new method of weighting asymmetries by powers of the dimuon pair transverse momentum relative to the beam. This technique provides direct access to certain $k_{\\rm T}^2$ moments of the transverse-momentum dependent parton distribution functions. These findings represent one of the most significant experimental advances in spin physics in recent years and are expected to remain a key reference point until new data from CLAS12, EIC, and LHCspin are available.",

As part of the community-driven initiative RadioMonteCarLow2, we aim to collect these Monte Carlo tools and facilitate their access. This initiative has been working on providing the community with codes that are able to produce differential cross section distributions for processes related to leptons and hadrons at centre-of-mass energies of a few GeV. Phase I of this effort cumulated in the publication of a detailed comparison of Monte Carlo codes for $e^+e^-$ scattering into muon, pion, and electron pairs, both for energy-scan and radiative-return experiments. This first phase is a theoretical study which focuses on comparisons without reference to experimental data, aiming to clarify the importance of different physics effects and approaches in realistic experimental setups.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Radiotherapy (RT) is a key treatment for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Tumours near the heart may result in unintended cardiac radiation exposure, increasing the risk of cardiotoxicity, such as de novo atrial fibrillation (DNAF) and de novo heart diseases (DNHD) as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, arterial hypertension or sudden cardiac death. This study investigated associations between radiation dose to cardiac substructures and risk of DNAF and DNHD.Patient/material and methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients treated between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2020 for NSCLC with definitive RT. The heart, right atrium (RA) and sinoatrial node (SAN) were delineated. Associations between dose-volume parameters and cardiac outcomes were analysed using multivariable models adjusted for relevant confounders. Kaplan-Meier curves estimated survival; p-values &lt; 0.05 were significant.Results: Among 273 included patients, 9.5% had AF pre-RT and 12.8% developed DNAF. DNAF was significantly associated with SAN Dmax (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.01), RA Dmax (HR = 1.02), RA Dmean (HR = 1.03), mean heart dose (MHD) (HR = 1.04) and heart V40Gy (HR = 1.03). One-year probabilities of DNAF and DNHD were 9.3% and 11%, increasing to 12.2% and 13.2% at 2 years. DNHD was significantly associated with SAN Dmax (HR = 1.02), RA Dmax (HR = 1.02), RA Dmean (HR = 1.04), MHD (HR = 1.06), heart V25Gy (HR = 1.03) and V40Gy (HR = 1.03). Interpretation: The RA and SAN may be considered organs at risk in future RT planning. Minimising cardiac radiation is important to reduce DNAF and DNHD risk. Validation in an independent cohort is warranted.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose: Advanced breast cancer (ABC) involves substantial end-of-life (EOL) healthcare use and costs. Understanding cost drivers can inform care delivery and resource allocation.Patient/material and methods: We conducted a retrospective, population-based study of individuals (n = 1,437) who died with breast cancer in the Stockholm Region (2015–2023). Healthcare utilization and costs during the last 12 months of life were obtained from the Stockholm Regional Healthcare Data Repository (VAL) and estimated using the Region Stockholm cost model. Variables included age, sex, socioeconomic status (Mosaic), Charlson Comorbidity Index, Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS), systemic therapy, and place of death. Descriptive statistics and generalized linear models assessed cost associations.Results: Total costs rose toward EOL, increasing 140% in the final 3 months versus the prior quarter. Hospitalizations and specialized palliative care drove costs, while outpatient visits declined. Younger age (18–69 years), high frailty (HFRS &gt; 15), and systemic therapy were independently associated with higher costs. Hospital death was associated with lower expenditures than dying elsewhere (rate ratio [RR]: 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78–0.91). The top 5% of cost users were mainly younger, frail patients receiving systemic therapy.Interpretation: ABC-related costs escalate in the final year of life, driven by hospitalizations, palliative care, and systemic therapies. Younger, frailer patients incur higher costs, while those dying in hospital settings are associated with lower costs. Early palliative integration and frailty-based risk stratification were associated with distinct patterns of healthcare utilization and costs toward the EOL.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Assessing functional abilities in stroke rehabilitation is essential, combining subjective self-reports with objective clinical evaluations. Methods: This study aimed to compare self-reported impairments from stroke patients with rehabilitation team evaluations using the ICF stroke core set at 3 time points: 1 month post-discharge, after 6 months, and 12 months post-diagnosis. Additionally, the study sought to identify ICF subdomains most impacting health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by EQ-5D. This longitudinal, retrospective observational study included consecutive 118 stroke patients at the Satahospital Rehabilitation Unit (2021–2022). Results: Results showed that, 1 month after discharge, patients rated their functioning higher than team assessments, particularly in cognitive domains. By 12 months, patients’ self-reports indicated lower functioning than team evaluations, with discrepancies diminishing over time. Objective assessments revealed significant improvements in mobility, self-care, and cognitive functions, while patients reported progress in life activities and social interactions but little change in physical or cognitive domains. Depression levels and self-care ability (washing) were the strongest predictors of improved HRQOL. Conclusion: These findings reveal that patients initially overestimate their abilities, influenced by a lack of awareness and emotional factors, while rehabilitation teams provide more objective evaluations and individualized rehabilitation. Integrated assessment frameworks combining subjective and objective perspectives are crucial to optimizing rehabilitation outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "To address the issues of hydrogen embrittlement and nanoparticle agglomeration that occur with coatings produced through traditional jet electrodeposition (TJE), this study introduces ultrasonic into the preparation process. Ni-Co-TiN composite coatings were successfully fabricated using ultrasonic vibration-assisted jet electrodeposition (UVAJE). The composite coatings were then characterized using techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical analysis. The effects of TiN addition and ultrasonic on the surface morphology, mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance of the composite coatings were thoroughly examined. Similarly, coating samples prepared by TJE were used for comparative analysis with UVAJE. The results revealed that all the coatings exhibited characteristic face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structures, and the introduction of ultrasonic and TiN directly affected the surface morphology as well as the properties of the composite coatings. Compared to TJE, the coatings produced through UVAJE demonstrated improved surface quality and overall properties. At a TiN addition equal to 4 g L -1 , the Ni-Co-TiN coating by UVAJE exhibited an evident reduction in honeycomb-like structures, resulting in increased smoothness. Under these conditions, the coating exhibited optimal properties, with 392.6±8.1 nm arithmetic mean roughness, 612.4±20.2 HV microhardness, 35.4±2.0 N adhesion strength, 214.44±5.62 MPa yield strength, 1.23±0.11 mm 3 N -1 m -1 wear rate, 1.17±0.21 μA cm -2 corrosion current density, and 1.4±0.1 mg corrosion loss.",

    "Abstract": "Scleromyxedema (SM) is a rare fibromucinous disorder typically associated with monoclonal gammopathy, but atypical variants without paraproteinemia and with coexistent thyroid dysfunction challenge traditional diagnostic criteria. An elderly male presented with progressive pruritic skin thickening and waxy papules on the limbs and trunk, exhibiting classic SM signs including the “Shar-Pei sign” and “doughnut sign.” Laboratory evaluation revealed subclinical hypothyroidism (elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies) but no paraproteinemia or other systemic abnormalities. Histopathology confirmed dermal mucin deposition, fibroblast proliferation, and fibrosis, supporting a diagnosis of atypical SM. The patient was treated conservatively with narrowband ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) phototherapy and levothyroxine (initially 25 µg/day, increased to 50 µg/day). Within 4 months, marked improvement was observed, including resolution of pruritus, flattening of papules, reduced induration, and restored mobility, sustained at 1-year follow-up. This case highlights that thyroid dysfunction should not preclude SM diagnosis, advocating for clinicopathologic correlation and longitudinal monitoring. Conservative therapies such as thyroid hormone replacement and NBUVB phototherapy may provide effective, accessible alternatives in select atypical cases, potentially expanding management options for this challenging condition.",

The aim of the study was to study the correlation of serum uric acid (SUA) with heart rate variability (HRV) in prediabetic individuals and patients with diabetes mellitus and also among male and females in the respective groups. Materials and Methods: In this study, we included a total of 56 participants, which comprised 28 individuals diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and 28 who were prediabetic. We conducted the HRV analysis using Power Lab from AD Instruments based in Australia. To determine the P -values, we employed a Student t -test. We also examined the correlations between SUA levels and HRV among the prediabetic group and diabetes mellitus patients, as well as between male and female subjects within these groups, using Pearson’s correlation. Results: The autonomic functions are deranged both in patients with diabetes and prediabetic group but the reduction in HRV is more pronounced in patients with diabetes. Males have more reduced HRV as compared to females in both the groups. The comparative analysis among the prediabetic males and females revealed that the total frequency was decreased in both the groups and moderate autonomic dysfunction was observed. The low frequency/high frequency ratio in pre-diabetic individuals was lower in males than females; though reduced in both the group, signifying symatho vagal imbalance in both males and females. Conclusion: There is a positive link between HRV and SUA levels in patients with diabetes. Prediabetic individuals having normal uric acid levels also exhibit a reduction in HRV. Earlier identification of cardiac autonomic dysfunction on HRV in pre-diabetic individuals and patients with diabetes mellitus will help prevent further cardiovascular complications.",

Material and Methods We extend their approach to scenarios where the covariate process is strictly stationary and ergodic. A significant advancement is the establishment of a martingale framework that elucidates the asymptotic properties of the projection estimator without requiring assumptions beyond ergodicity. Results We demonstrate that this estimator achieves the minimax-optimal convergence rate concerning the mean integrated square error (MISE) across Besov spaces. Additionally, we propose a data-driven technique for selecting the truncation parameter, and we validate our theoretical results through numerical simulations conducted on ergodic data. Conclusion This extension broadens the theoretical and practical reach of wavelet-based regression to a wide class of dependent data scenarios and provides a robust estimation framework for ergodic data common in fields like econometrics and signal processing.",

Eligible studies compared AC and GA in adults with supratentorial gliomas and reported outcomes on extent of resection, neurological preservation, survival, safety, quality of life, or cost-effectiveness. Data extraction was performed independently by three reviewers, and study quality was assessed with Risk of Bias 2, Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, or AMSTAR 2. Due to heterogeneity, findings were synthesized narratively. Results: Six studies were included (4 primary, 2 reviews); only two directly compared approaches. Extent of resection ( P = 0.657, P = 0.17), overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, P = 0.48), and progression-free survival (adjusted HR 0.9, P = 0.66) showed no significant differences. AC cost $2,175 more per case ( P &lt; 0.001). Neurocognitive function was generally preserved; psychomotor speed declined most. Conclusion: Neither approach demonstrated superiority. AC enables functional monitoring but offers no survival benefit and increases costs. Surgical decisions should be individualized. High-quality randomized trials are needed.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Pediatric tumors of the posterior fossa represent a significant challenge in neurosurgery. Various dural substitutes have been used to repair dural defects, with a wide range of success rates and associated complications. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of autologous cervical fascia duraplasty, describe surgical technique, and report incidence rates of postoperative complications. Methods: A retrospective observational study included 24 pediatric patients (1–16 years) with posterior fossa tumors who underwent tumor resection with autologous cervical fascia dural closure at a tertiary hospital in Mexico between 2019 and 2024. Postoperative complications were assessed over 12 months. Tumor resection and watertight dural closure used a 5 × 5 cm fascia graft harvested from the superficial layer of the cervical fascia, with careful preservation of the underlying musculature and occipital nerve. Medical records were reviewed to collect demographic data and postoperative outcomes. Results: 13 of 24 patients were male (54.2%), and 13 of 24 patients (54.2%) had preoperative hydrocephalus. No procedure-related mortality was observed. Postoperative complications included aseptic meningitis in 2 cases (8.3%) and hydrocephalus requiring VP shunt in 3 cases (12.5%). No cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas, pseudomeningoceles, or wound dehiscence were observed. Conclusion: Autologous cervical fascia duraplasty is a safe and effective technique for pediatric posterior fossa tumor surgery, providing reliable watertight closure with low rate of CSF leak, pseudomeningocele, hydrocephalus, and aseptic meningitis. Its accessibility and lower cost make it a practical option in low-resource settings.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) detects ischemic injury after microsurgical clipping of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs), yet non-ischemic parenchymal effects remain poorly characterized. This study evaluated early postoperative T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) abnormalities to characterize corridor-related tissue impact and identify anatomical determinants of non-ischemic parenchymal changes. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 797 anterior circulation UIA clipping procedures performed by a single surgeon under uniform protocol. Early postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (day 4–5) and 12-month follow-up were obtained. T2WI hyperintensities without restricted diffusion were classified as non-ischemic parenchymal changes. Stratified analyses isolated the effects of aneurysm depth within trans-sylvian (TS) approaches and rectal gyrus separation within interhemispheric (IH) approaches. Multivariate regression identified independent predictors. Results: Non-ischemic T2WI changes occurred in 20.1% (160/797) of procedures. IH approaches showed significantly higher incidence (50.7%) than TS approaches (13.8%, P &lt; 0.001). Within IH approaches, anterior communicating artery aneurysms demonstrated a higher incidence (68.8%) than distal anterior cerebral artery aneurysms (11.6%, P &lt; 0.001). Independent predictors included IH approach (odds ratio [OR] = 3.34, P &lt; 0.001), deep location (OR = 2.28, P &lt; 0.001), and aneurysm size ≥7 mm (OR = 1.71, P = 0.015). At 12-month follow-up, 97.2% of lesions resolved or decreased. DWI-detected ischemia occurred in 7.0% of procedures. No permanent neurological deficits occurred. Conclusion: Early postoperative T2WI abnormalities represent a distinct imaging signature of corridor-related tissue impact, strongly associated with approach depth and anatomy. Their reversibility indicates transient mechanical stress rather than permanent injury. T2WI serves as an objective biomarker complementing DWI-based assessment and may inform surgical quality monitoring and patient counseling.",

Case Description: A 44-year-old female presented with a 5-year history of chronic low back pain and intermittent dysesthesia but had no neurological deficits. The magnetic resonance revealed an extradural cyst at D12-L1, isointense to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and displacing the dural sac ventrally. The patient underwent a D12-L1 hemilaminectomy for excision of a thin-walled cyst; there were adhesions to the conus, and we encountered no CSF leakage. Postoperatively, pain rapidly improved, and the patient remains asymptomatic.

    "Abstract": "Background: Adult primary spinal tumors (PST) are under-reported, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, including Pakistan. Notably, despite the limited availability of Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM), we safely managed 137 patients with spinal cord tumors at a tertiary center over 10 years. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed demographic, neurological status (i.e., evaluation using Modified McCormick Scale preoperatively/postoperatively), surgical outcomes, and progression-free survival (PFS) for 137 patients operated for primary spinal cord tumors over 10 years. Results: These 137 patients with mean age 40.8 ± 15.1 years were followed up for an average of 8.7 months after surgery. Pre-operative common symptoms included lower extremity weakness (61, 44.5%) and back pain (50, 36.5%). Tumors were located mainly in the cervical (49, 36.6%) and thoracic spine (43, 32.1%). With IONM use in 29 (21.5%) patients, gross total resection (GTR; 25 [86.2%]) was achieved for the majority of tumors. IONM was not available for 106 patients. Of the latter, 90 (85.0%) had GTR. Notably, GTR was the only significant predictor of PFS ( P = 0.03). At last follow-up, MMS improved in 97 (70.8%) of patients, was unchanged in 25 (18.2%), and worsened in 15 (11.0%). Conclusion: We found in Pakistan that many of the 137 patients with spinal cord tumors presented late in their clinical course, often with significant neurological deficits; this highlights the need for earlier and better diagnostic capacity and referral pathways. Despite limited IONM availability due to limited resources, GTR rates and neurological improvement were achieved. Nevertheless, we still advocate using IONM where resources allow.",

Although flow diverters (FDs) are commonly used, the PPTA can maintain collateral inflow to the aneurysm sac, preventing complete thrombosis. Case Description: A 74-year-old woman presented with progressive oculomotor nerve palsy and visual decline. High-flow external carotid-middle cerebral artery bypass with distal ICA occlusion beyond the aneurysm was performed. The bypass remained patent without infarction, and partial aneurysm thrombosis occurred, whereas PPTA flow was preserved. Conclusion: This case emphasizes the importance of individual microsurgical strategies if FD treatment may be ineffective due to complex embryonic vascular anatomy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is currently approved for conditions such as drug-resistant epilepsy and stroke with promising results. In addition, it is also being investigated for many other conditions. The goal of this study is to review the scope of VNS clinical trials. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of active and completed clinical trials using ClinicalTrials.gov, with “Vagus Nerve Stimulation” as the search term. The number of studies taking place over time was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficient. Results: An examination of ClinicalTrials.gov revealed 440 clinical trials, with 346 meeting our inclusion criteria. The number of VNS clinical trials increased annually from 2000 to 2024, demonstrating exponential growth after 2015 ( P &lt; 0.001, R 2 = 0.924). Of these, 42.5% were completed, with published results being available for 9.8% of the completed trials. Completed trials were predominantly from the United States, spanning various conditions including a wide variety of disorders such as cardiovascular diseases ( n = 38), chronic pain disorders ( n = 31), gastrointestinal disorders ( n = 24), autoimmune disorders ( n = 23), neurodegenerative diseases ( n = 19), COVID-19 ( n = 13) and diabetes ( n = 11). Among the included trials, 86% were non-invasive with 91% of trials with results reporting improvements in symptoms. Conclusion: This increasing number of trials assessing a wide breadth of clinical disorders suggests the promising future of VNS as from the currently approved treatments. Physicians should familiarize themselves with these results and potentially upcoming indications for VNS.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) aquaculture accounts for nearly 80% of Ghana’s farmed fish production, with cage culture on Volta Lake as the dominant system. In recent years, production has been severely constrained by high disease-related mortalities, notably due to Streptococcus agalactiae and Infectious Spleen and Kidney Necrosis Virus (ISKNV). This study investigated how farm management practices and farmers’ knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions influence disease dynamics on Volta Lake. Methods A cross-sectional survey of 56 farms across five districts was conducted using semi-structured questionnaires and interviews with farmers and the local fish health officer. Results showed that disease outbreaks were reported in all farms, with mortalities ranging from 10-80%. Results Farmers attributed outbreaks primarily to pathogens, but also to poor water quality, high stocking densities, and inadequate biosecurity. Diagnostic practices varied, with most farmers relying on clinical signs or peer consultation rather than laboratory testing. Clinical signs commonly reported included exophthalmia, swollen abdomens, and skin lesions. Farm management practices such as grading, sourcing of fingerlings, water quality monitoring, and biosecurity were inconsistent and largely unstandardized. Regression analysis indicated that stocking density, biosecurity, and water quality monitoring did not significantly predict disease-related mortality, underscoring the multifactorial nature of outbreaks in this open water system. Discussion The findings highlight the need for coordinated extension services, accessible diagnostic facilities, and standardized farm management protocols to strengthen disease prevention and control in Ghana’s cage aquaculture sector.",

    "Abstract": "Background Crocodilians are well endowed with multiple cutaneous receptors and specializations, such as integumentary sensory organs (ISOs), which provide formidable mechanical sensitivity despite their protected shield. We investigated the free intraepidermal nerve terminals, focusing on the desmosomes, transitional desmosomes (TDs), corneodesmosomes (CD), and the tonofibril (TF) network that potentially act as force transducers to activate the mechanoreceptors. Material and Methods Two Cuban crocodiles ( Crocodylus rhombifer) were analyzed using light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) after glutaraldehyde fixation and decalcification. Results Discoid nerve terminals were richly enclosed by an epidermal force-transmitting system (e.g., pressure and vibration) through a rigid network of diverse desmosomes and CDs. TDs were anchored to keratinocyte’s cytoskeletons via a dense meshwork of intermediate filaments or TFs, creating a continuous, mechanically-linked web connecting nerve terminals in the epidermis to the stratum corneum. The cutaneous receptors were innervated by myelinated and unmyelinated neural complexes surrounded by thin-walled mesothelial cells. Discussion Here, we describe for the first time the ultrastructure of TDs in the crocodile skin with diverse expression of CDs that may focus and amplify force via a tonofibril system “hugging” the receptor. Corneocytes, granular keratinocytes, and nerve endings function as a single integrated system. Thereby, mechanical strain is gathered from a relatively large area of the epidermis and concentrated onto the small surface of the discoid receptor. This may ensure that any deformation of the surrounding corneocytes is efficiently and reliably transferred to the nerve membrane, allowing the crocodile to detect very subtle stimuli. The crocodile system appears to have a far more structured and specialized adaptation for high-fidelity mechanosensation than that of humans.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) secondary to congenital left-to-right shunt heart disease (CL-RSHD) is a life-threatening complication with unclear microbial and metabolic mechanisms. This study investigated gut microbiota and plasma metabolic alterations in CL-RSHD-associated PAH to identify biomarkers and mechanistic pathways. Methods This cross-sectional study included 86 participants: healthy controls (HC, n = 13), CL-RSHD ( n = 46), and CL-RSHD + PAH ( n = 27). Gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the V3–V4 region on 41 fecal samples (HC, n = 9; CL-RSHD, n = 15; and CL-RSHD + PAH, n = 17). Untargeted plasma metabolomics was analyzed on all 86 plasma samples. Microbial diversity, differential taxa (DESeq2), metabolic pathways (OPLS-DA, KEGG), and biomarker potential (ROC curves) were assessed. Dynamic correlations linked microbiota-metabolite interactions. Results CL-RSHD + PAH patients showed preserved α/β-diversity but distinct taxonomic shifts: enriched Lachnoclostridium phocaeense (Firmicutes) and reduced SCFA-producing Anaerostipes. Metabolomics revealed dysregulated steroid biosynthesis, cortisol metabolism, and oxidative stress pathways. Key metabolites, including elevated 5-hydroxymethylcytidine (5-hmC) and γ-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine, and reduced histidine intermediate D-E1IG3P, correlated with PAH severity. Strong microbiota-metabolite interactions (e.g., Lactonifactor -D-E1IG3P, r = 0.82, P &amp;lt; 0.01) suggested a disrupted vascular remodeling axis. Metabolites like ADP-glucose (AUC = 0.94) and 3-phenylpropyl glucosinolate (AUC = 0.92) showed high diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion CL-RSHD-associated PAH involves gut microbial restructuring and metabolic reprogramming linked to immune-inflammatory activation and oxidative stress. The Firmicutes-histidine metabolism axis emerges as a therapeutic target. Despite limitations, this study provides foundational insights into microbial-metabolic drivers of PAH, highlighting novel biomarkers for early diagnosis and intervention.",

    "Abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by persistent synovial inflammation, progressive cartilage and bone destruction, and resulting functional disability. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial, involving both genetic predisposition and environmental influences. In recent years, the interaction between the oral microbiota and RA has emerged as a prominent research focus. Dysbiosis of the oral microbiome, defined as an imbalance in microbial composition relative to a healthy state, accompanies disease onset and may further act as a trigger of systemic autoimmune responses. Specific virulence factors, including the peptidylarginine deiminase from Porphyromonas gingivalis and leukotoxin A from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans , promote excessive protein citrullination and anti-citrullinated protein antibody generation, thereby contributing to the loss of immune tolerance, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals. Moreover, the bidirectional relationship between RA and periodontitis highlights shared inflammatory pathways that contribute to both periodontal and joint tissue destruction. Potential mechanisms include bacteremia induced by routine oral activities, systemic dissemination of bacterial products, and colonization of oral microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract. Current evidence suggests that periodontal therapy may reduce systemic inflammatory markers and occasionally improve RA activity, although results remain inconsistent. In this review, we explored the potential mechanisms underlying the imbalance of the oral microbiota and its contribution to the onset and progression of RA, focusing on microbially induced citrullination, host genetic susceptibility, and common inflammatory pathways, while also discussing the impact of comprehensive periodontal management and lifestyle interventions on RA outcomes. Overall, these insights underscore the role of the oral microbiome in RA pathogenesis and suggest that addressing microbial dysbiosis through integrated therapeutic strategies may complement conventional care.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The collagen and elastin fibres of the pre-Descemet layer or Dua layer (PDL) fan out to become the beams of the trabecular meshwork (TM), indicating similarities in the structural elements in the PDL and TM. This study evaluated the effects of disruption of the PDL and Descemet membrane (DM) on the facility of aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber, using human eyes and an anterior segment perfusion model (ASPM). Methods The ASPM was established using human donor eyes. The PDL and DM in the experimental eyes were half incised circumferentially along an 8 mm diameter circle for 180°, and the other half was left non-incised. Results The experimental eyes in the ASPM model exhibited a decrease in the outflow rate, indicating an increased outflow resistance. In the TM, the expressions of fibronectin, myocilin and alpha-smooth muscle actin were increased in incised compared to non-incised and control samples. The outflow perfusates in the experimental eyes showed a significant increase in the level of active MMP-9 on day 4 and a subsequent decrease on day 9 compared to the control eyes. Myocilin was only detected in the perfusate on day 9 in the experimental eyes. Conclusion Our study suggests that surgical disruption of the PDL and DM results in decreased outflow, which can be due to an alteration in biomechanical properties, with consequent molecular changes in the TM, adversely affecting the resistance to outflow. This could explain why the incidence of raised pressure is greater with penetrating keratoplasty compared to deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty.",

    "Abstract": "Objective To investigate the temporal changes and recovery patterns of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (dCA) after carotid artery stenting (CAS) in patients with severe internal carotid artery stenosis. Methods In this prospective study, 44 patients undergoing CAS (19 symptomatic and 25 asymptomatic) and 44 age-matched healthy controls were enrolled. Patients in the CAS group underwent dCA assessments at four time points: pre-CAS (baseline, within 24 h prior to surgery), postoperative day 1 (POD 1), postoperative day 3 (POD 3), and 1 month postoperatively (POM 1). dCA was quantified using transfer function analysis (TFA), including phase difference (PD) and gain, to evaluate dCA. Results Pre-CAS, patients had bilateral dCA impairment, worse on the affected (stenotic) side (PD: affected side: 30.56 ± 19.87° vs. unaffected side: 43.29 ± 23.29°, p &amp;lt; 0.001; both lower than healthy controls at 52.96 ± 14.82°, affected side: p &amp;lt; 0.001, unaffected side: p = 0.019). After CAS, dCA recovered rapidly. The affected side’s PD improved to the unaffected (non-stenotic) level by day 1 (POD 1 PD: affected side: 36.94 ± 20.59°, unaffected side: 41.69 ± 23.29°, p &amp;gt; 0.05), and both sides reached the level of healthy controls by day 3 (POD 3 PD: affected side: 47.71 ± 23.64°, unaffected side: 51.07 ± 24.43°, p &amp;gt; 0.05). The recovery trajectory was consistent between symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups and aligned with the overall patient cohort. Conclusion Unilateral severe carotid stenosis impairs bilateral dCA, while CAS significantly restores cerebral autoregulation. Recovery is faster on the affected side, reaching the unaffected level within 1 day, and both hemispheres reach healthy control levels by day 3. Early CAS intervention can timely improve dCA regardless of symptom status.",

    "Abstract": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) represents one of the most prevalent hereditary renal disorders, affecting an estimated 12.5 million individuals globally and characterized by progressive cyst formation in both kidneys. While mutations in PKD1 and PKD2 genes account for most cases, recent research has identified rare causative genes as contributing factors in genetically unresolved cases. The review examines the molecular mechanisms of cystogenesis, highlighting how genetic predisposition interacts with epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation patterns, histone alterations, and non-coding RNAs (miRNAs and piRNAs). Advanced diagnostic approaches, from conventional imaging to AI-assisted cyst segmentation and long-read sequencing technologies, are evaluated for their clinical utility. Long-read sequencing platforms increase diagnostic yield by up to 25% in previously unsolved cases, while AI-enhanced imaging provides superior accuracy in disease progression monitoring. Finally, the paper explores emerging precision medicine strategies, including targeted therapies directed at specific molecular pathways, risk stratification algorithms, and personalized treatment approaches based on individual genetic and epigenetic profiles. This integration of genomic and epigenomic insights provides a foundation for improved prognostic models, early biomarkers, and tailored therapeutic interventions for ADPKD patients.",

    "Abstract": "Robot failures in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), though often stemming from technical limitations, can have severe effects on the interactional dynamics between humans and robots. Prior empirical research has led to conflicting findings on how such failures influence user perceptions and the overall success of the interaction. In this study, we investigate how human participants respond to robot failures on a moment-to-moment basis, with a particular focus on how social roles, responsibilities, and agency are negotiated as these episodes unfold. We examine how responses and helping behaviors are instantiated, and which factors facilitate or hinder recovery strategies. We focus on kinematic failures, such as interruptions in motion, unsuccessful grasping, or dropping objects, that occurred during Tic-Tac-Toe games between human participants (n = 17) and the humanoid robot Epi. Our analysis combines multimodal conversation analysis (MCA) and thick description, drawing on our interdisciplinary backgrounds in cognitive science and feminist Science and Technology Studies (STS). We present selected interactional sequences that illustrate a range of participant responses, including physical repair and scaffolding, interpretive support, emotional care, sustained monitoring, and dynamic negotiation of agency. These observations demonstrate how humans co-construct interactional continuity and robot competence through distributed, multimodal, and affective forms of help. They also reveal how agency is dynamically reconfigured, and how roles and responsibilities are distributed across human and robotic actors. We show how the burden of repair often falls to the human participant and conclude by reflecting on the setting and methods used, specifically in regards to the role of the robot as a research tool.",

    "Abstract": "The total solar eclipse of April 8, 2024 presented a uniquely favorable circumstance for radio science. The Moon’s shadow passed near Canadian time standard station CHU, which transmits in the high frequency (HF, i.e. , 3–30 MHz) band. It was therefore possible to observe signal changes due to shifting ionospheric conditions along the path of the eclipse by using CHU as a signal of opportunity. In under 3 months, our undergraduate team developed and deployed low-cost instrumentation to record CHU for timing and amplitude analysis. 18 units were distributed across 6 locations roughly aligned with the eclipse path. Each unit contained a radio recorder which retained time traceability to UTC via GPS time synchronization, allowing capture of the CHU signal with no unbounded error beyond the 50 µs sampling interval. Seven units captured changes in the received signal during the eclipse, most notably a tenfold increase in the signal strength at 7.85 MHz for a unit in Little Rock, AR. Its timing suggests a one-hop propagation path reflecting in the ionosphere over Cleveland, OH. The stations were deployed to and maintained by volunteers contacted through the amateur radio and citizen science community. This campaign demonstrates the accessibility and effectiveness of research using low-cost instrumentation and the power of citizen science.",

    "Abstract": "Multi-view clustering, which improves clustering performance by using the complementary and consistent information from multiple diverse feature sets, has been attracting increasing research attention owing to its broad applicability in real world scenarios. Conventional approaches typically leverage this complementarity by projecting different views into a common embedding space using view-specific or shared non-linear neural networks. This unified embedding is then fed into standard single-view clustering algorithms to obtain the final clustering results. However, a single common embedding may be insufficient to capture the distinct or even contradictory characteristics of multi-view data, due to the divergent representational capacities of different views. To address this issue, we propose a mixture of experts (MoE) based embedding learning method that adaptively models inter-view relationships. This architecture employs a typical MoE module as a projection layer across all views, which uses shared expert and several groups of experts for consistency and complementarity mining. Furthermore, a Kullback-Leibler divergence based objective with over clustering is designed for clustering-oriented embedding learning. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets confirm that our method achieves superior performance compared to a number of state-of-the-art approaches.",

    "Abstract": "To investigate the hypersonic boundary layer transition over complex three-dimensional configurations, this study conducted an experiment using infrared thermography, Rayleigh scattering visualization, and high-frequency pressure sensors in a Mach 6 Ludwieg wind tunnel. The infrared results indicate that increasing the Reynolds number promotes boundary layer transition on the model surface. Spectral analysis reveals a high-frequency peak centered at 250 kHz on the finless side of the windward surface. Comprehensive analysis indicates this represents high-frequency secondary instability triggered by the traveling crossflow mode in its nonlinear phase. On the finless side of the leeward surface, a typical Mack second-mode high-frequency instability amplification process is observed within the 140–280 kHz frequency band. Additionally, the spectrum results for the fin–cone junction became more complex. On the windward side, the primary energy concentration in the junction zone is observed between 80 and 200 kHz, with calculated wave packet velocities higher than those on the finless side. Wavelet analysis reveals that low-frequency modes are amplified first and gradually excite high-frequency components, with significant modal coupling appearing in the high-frequency region of the bicoherence. The leeward fin–cone junction exhibits dual-band characteristics at 60–120 kHz and 180–260 kHz, demonstrating stronger intermodal interactions. Both the windward and leeward surfaces of the fin show low-frequency transverse flow-like modes around 70–180 kHz. The spectral results for the windward and leeward sides are largely consistent, with only slight differences in amplitude levels and saturation positions.",

    "Abstract": "The reliability of magnet wire insulation is critical for the safe and efficient operation of aerospace electric machines exposed to extreme electrical and environmental conditions. Polyimide-based insulations are widely used due to their excellent thermal and dielectric properties; however, they face challenges such as space charge accumulation, partial discharge activity, and accelerated aging under combined stressors. This study investigates the dielectric breakdown behavior of MW35-C class magnet wire subjected to both AC and DC electrical stress under sub-atmospheric pressures representative of aerospace environments. Experimental measurements were performed on 13 AWG, 15 AWG, and 20 AWG wires, all sourced from the same manufacturer but differing in core conductor radius and total insulation thickness. The results were statistically analyzed using the Weibull distribution. To complement the experimental analysis, 3D finite element simulations were conducted to evaluate electric field distributions at the contact interface between wires. The results demonstrate that breakdown strength is significantly affected by ambient pressure, wire geometry (core radius and insulation thickness), and the volume effect. Among the tested wires, 20 AWG exhibited the highest breakdown strength, attributed to its favorable conductor-to-insulation ratio and reduced insulation volume, which lowers the probability of critical defects. These findings provide valuable insights for the design and qualification of robust insulation systems in all-electric and more-electric aircraft operating in low-pressure environments.",

Data collection focused on product types, machinery, production capacity, operational status, challenges, and quality management. The study revealed significant technical and infrastructural deficiencies. Key challenges include reliance on inefficient sun-drying, inadequate infrastructure, lack of basic utilities, obsolete machinery, poor local capacity for machine repair, minimal adherence to Good Manufacturing Practices, and inadequate product quality testing, all leading to inconsistent product quality. The study highlights urgent need for investments in efficient drying facilities, equipment upgrades, and capacity building in quality control and business management.

    "Abstract": "Enhancing crop diversity is a key pillar of the EU’s 2023–2027 CAP eco-schemes, yet Poland’s long-standing crop simplification raises doubts about the policy’s effectiveness. This study assesses the determinants of crop structure and crop diversity in Poland and evaluates whether eco-schemes generate measurable improvements at farm and municipal scales. A multilevel approach integrates municipality-level saturation with ecological interventions (eco-schemes, organic farming, and agri-environment–climate measures) with longitudinal data from 192 purposively selected farms across all 16 voivodeships for 2016, 2021, and 2024. Crop diversity is measured using the Shannon–Wiener index (H′), combined with indicators of specialization, farm size, and participation in CAP instruments. Spatial and temporal comparisons reveal that farms engaged in commercial animal production maintain simplified crop structures, which is associated with specialization as a dominant factor in low diversity. Maize share increased steadily from 12.4% to 16.7%, signalling ongoing homogenization, particularly in livestock-intensive regions. Contrary to earlier assumptions, smaller farms did not exhibit higher diversity, suggesting organizational constraints. At the municipal level, greater saturation with eco-schemes and organic farming was associated with higher H′ values, while areas with strong agri-environment–climate presence—often mountainous—showed lower diversity due to biophysical limits. The findings highlight structural barriers that may limit eco-scheme impacts.",

    "Abstract": "In the poultry industry, measures related to combating antimicrobial resistance have accelerated the search for safe and effective alternatives capable of sustaining production while limiting the spread of pathogens in livestock farms. Among these, postbiotics have recently emerged as a promising solution to overcome the use of traditional in-feed additives. Defined as preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confer a health benefit to the host, postbiotics appear to combine biological effects with improved technological stability. Numerous studies have highlighted their beneficial effects on gut morphology, mucus production, immune modulation, microbiota composition and feed conversion ratio. Moreover, several postbiotic formulations exhibit protective effects against pathogens, suggesting a potential role in disease prevention. Overall, current evidence indicates that postbiotics are a valuable tool for improving poultry health, productivity and food safety while reducing reliance on antibiotics. This review summarises the studies on the use of postbiotics in poultry, providing a framework for their documented benefits. It also aims to highlight the limitations associated with their application and the existing knowledge gaps—particularly regarding mechanisms of action, optimal dosages, and methods of administration—in order to support standardisation and ensure reproducibility within the livestock industry.",

    "Abstract": "Salinity–alkalinity stress is one of the major abiotic stresses that limit rice production in the world. The salinity–alkalinity tolerance of rice at the germination stage has a direct effect on the survival and final yield of seedlings in direct sowing. However, there are few reports of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and mapping-based cloning of alkaline tolerance at the bud burst stage. Here, new alkaline tolerance loci were constructed for F2:3 and BC3F4 by using IR36 and Long-Dao124 (LD124) rice varieties with significant differences in alkaline tolerance. Through linkage analysis and a fine-mapping strategy, qAT3 was identified as the major QTL for alkaline tolerance at the bud burst stage, which could explain 14.79% of the phenotypic variation on average. Then the interval was fine-mapped to 110.265 kb, and the candidate gene LOC_Os03g03150 was predicted by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis and sequencing analysis. This provides a key theory for the molecular breeding of alkali-tolerant genes and the study of the molecular mechanism of alkali tolerance in LD124.",

    "Abstract": "The incorporation of alfalfa into grass systems reduces reliance on nitrogen fertilizer application. Over two consecutive years, we investigated the regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism in grasses and productivity enhancement under four nitrogen application rates (0, 105, 210, and 315 kg·ha−1) and five alfalfa incorporation levels (0%, 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40%); incorporation (%) refers strictly to seeding proportion (% of the monoculture seeding rate). Within the range of 20–30% alfalfa incorporation and 105–210 kg·ha−1 nitrogen application, key physiological and biochemical parameters, except the net photosynthetic rate (Pn), reached their peak values compared to the N0A0 (no nitrogen and no alfalfa) treatment. Transpiration rate (Tr), intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and stomatal conductance (Gs) increased by 43.64%, 40%, and 48.09%, respectively. Pn peaked under the N2A0 treatment (210 kg·ha−1 nitrogen application and no alfalfa), increased by 65.63%. Nitrate reductase (NR), glutamine synthetase (GS), and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBisCO) activity increased by 154.60%, 112.39%, and 199.19%, respectively. Total sugar (TS) and protein production (YCP) increased by 122.22% and 145.17%, respectively.

    "Abstract": "We present RoBaseLM-S (125 M) and RoBaseLM-M (260 M), two compact Romanian decoder-only language models trained from scratch on a 4.3 B-token curated corpus. Architecturally, they follow a modern LLaMA-style recipe with pre-norm RMSNorm, rotary position embeddings, SwiGLU feed-forward blocks, grouped-query attention, and 4 k-token context windows. We release both full-precision (FP16) and post-training 5-bit (Q5_K_M) checkpoints in GGUF format for lightweight local inference. The 5-bit variants fit under 500 MB and generate text in real time on a Jetson Nano 4 GB, enabling fully offline Romanian text generation on consumer-grade edge hardware. We evaluate the models intrinsically (multi-domain perplexity across news, literary prose, poetry, and heterogeneous web text) and extrinsically (LaRoSeDa sentiment classification and RO-STS sentence similarity). Relative to Romanian GPT-2–style baselines at similar parameter scales, RoBaseLM-S and RoBaseLM-M reduce perplexity substantially, e.g., from 30.7 to 15.9 on our held-out news split. The 5-bit post-training quantized checkpoints remain within FP16 performance across all reported tasks. To our knowledge, these are the first Romanian small language models explicitly optimized for long-context inference, post-training quantization, and low-power on-device deployment.",

A total of 67 limbs were evaluated. Ultrasonography demonstrated greater agreement with ex vivo measurements than radiography. Ultrasonographic assessment was considered appropriate for measuring trochlear groove depth with the stifle joint in maximal extension, with the transducer positioned distal to the patella, and at 90° of flexion, with the transducer positioned proximal to the patella.",

    "Abstract": "The induction of triploidy, a strategy to mitigate unwanted pre-harvest sexual maturation and a genetic containment measure for escaped farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), may give rise to challenges because of the distinct environmental and dietary requirements of sterile triploid fish. Smoltification is a critical phase in the life cycle of Atlantic salmon, so knowledge about parr–smolt transformation in triploids is important for the salmon farming industry. This study covered an investigation of hepatic expression of growth hormone receptor (GHrec) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) genes, both of which are intimately involved in the regulation of osmoregulation and growth. Additionally, hepatic presence and location of IGF-I mRNA were examined using RNAscope®, an advanced in situ hybridization technique. Triplicate groups of juvenile diploid and triploid salmon were reared at low temperature (10 °C) and fed either a standard diet or one enriched with hydrolyzed fish proteins from the start of feeding onwards. Liver samples were collected from three fish per tank each month from October to December (2454–3044 degree-days post-start feeding), the period encompassing smoltification, and hepatic expression of IGF-I and GHrec genes was quantified by real-time PCR. The results indicated that neither ploidy nor diet significantly influenced IGF-I or GHrec gene expression, suggesting that, under our conditions, triploidy and diet did not adversely affect this molecular pathway linked to growth and osmoregulation. IGF-I gene expression exhibited significant temporal variation, correlating with the progression of smoltification, while GHrec gene expression showed a similar, albeit non-significant, trend. Triploids exhibited IGF-I and GHrec gene expression patterns comparable to diploids, and both the temporal changes and lack of difference between triploids and diploids were mirrored in the quantification of IGF-I mRNA within the liver cells. The potential applicability to a commercial aquaculture setting requires further investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Gramicidin S (GS) is a cyclic antimicrobial peptide with strong antibacterial activity but significant cytotoxicity toward mammalian cells. This study evaluated GS-induced cytotoxicity in L929 fibroblast cells using both traditional 2D monolayer cultures and more physiologically relevant 3D spheroid models, and assessed whether liposomal encapsulation could mitigate toxicity and improve biocompatibility. Methods: L929 cells were cultured in monolayers and spheroids and treated with free GS or GS encapsulated in liposomes of varying lipid compositions. Cell viability and morphology were evaluated after 24 h of exposure using standard cytotoxicity assays. Results: Control liposomes, regardless of tested lipid type or concentration, showed no adverse effects on cell morphology or viability. Free GS caused pronounced, dose-dependent cytotoxicity in monolayers, decreasing viability to 11.0 ± 1.9% and 0.5 ± 1.1% at 50 and 75 µg/mL, respectively. By contrast, encapsulation in liposomes significantly reduced toxicity (p &lt; 0.05), preserving 80.3–82.2% viability at 75 µg/mL depending on formulation, corresponding to protection factors exceeding 160-fold (80.3% vs. 0.5%). Spheroid cultures showed slightly higher resistance to GS; free GS reduced viability to 2.9%, while liposomal GS preserved it above 84.8%, depending on lipid composition. Conclusions: Liposomal encapsulation effectively reduces GS-induced cytotoxicity, likely by limiting direct membrane disruption. Moreover, spheroid models provide a more physiologically relevant and predictive platform for toxicity testing, while the results support nanoliposomes as a practical delivery strategy to enhance the safety of antimicrobial peptides during preclinical development.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: The global rise in antimicrobial resistance poses a growing threat to public health, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where diagnostic capacity and surveillance systems remain limited. In these settings, optimizing empiric antibiotic prescribing is critical, and syndromic antibiograms offer a promising approach to support evidence-based decision-making. This study examines anticipated barriers and facilitators to the adoption of syndromic antibiograms from the perspectives of pediatric clinicians and laboratory professionals at Maputo Central Hospital in Mozambique. Methods: Guided by the Dynamic Adaptation Process (DAP) framework, this qualitative study used semi-structured interviews with eighteen healthcare professionals to explore empiric antibiotic prescribing practices, perceptions of syndromic antibiograms, and system-level barriers and facilitators. Data were analyzed thematically using deductive codes derived from the DAP framework alongside inductive codes generated from participants’ narratives. Results: Barriers were identified at individual, organizational, and systems levels. Individual barriers included limited awareness, reliance on traditional practices, and resistance to change. Organizational barriers included weak leadership support, insufficient training, poor communication between clinicians and laboratory staff, suboptimal sample collection, heavy workloads, and staff shortages. Systems-level barriers comprised shortages of laboratory supplies and medicines, delays in laboratory results, and weak monitoring mechanisms. Facilitators included health worker motivation for evidence-based practice, organizational collaboration, peer and team support, and the presence of influential champions. Systems-level enablers included functional laboratory services, supportive institutional environments, alignment with clinical guidelines, and recognition of clinical utility. Conclusions: Successful implementation of syndromic antibiograms in LMIC will require addressing systemic and organizational barriers while fostering professional motivation, collaboration, and institutional support. Sustainable integration will depend on coordinated strategies—including resource strengthening, continuous training, supportive leadership, and structured monitoring—that collectively strengthen antimicrobial stewardship and inform health policy.",

    "Abstract": "Condition monitoring of rotating machinery is critical for ensuring industrial safety and operational reliability. As a core component of intelligent diagnostic systems, domain adaptation methods have achieved notable progress in mechanical fault diagnosis. However, most existing approaches presume a fully shared label space between source and target domains, limiting their effectiveness under partial domain adaptation scenarios commonly encountered in industrial practice. In addition, they often struggle with classification uncertainty near decision boundaries. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Selective Adversarial Augmentation Network (SAAN) for cross-domain rolling bearing fault diagnosis with partial label space alignment. The proposed framework designs a multi-level feature extraction module to enhance transferable feature representation and a Balanced Augmentation Selective Adversarial Module (BASAM) to dynamically balance class distributions and selectively filter irrelevant source classes, thereby mitigating negative transfer and achieving fine-grained class alignment. Furthermore, an uncertainty suppression mechanism is put forth to reinforce classifier boundaries by minimizing the impact of ambiguous samples. Comprehensive experiments conducted on public and proprietary bearing datasets demonstrate that SAAN consistently surpasses state-of-the-art benchmarks in diagnostic accuracy and robustness, providing an effective solution for practical applications under class-imbalanced and variable operating conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Conventional multi-channel ultrasonic motor (USM) drive systems commonly adopt a one-motor–one-driver architecture, in which each drive channel requires an independent isolated power supply and inverter stage. As the number of motors increases, the system volume and structural complexity grow significantly. To address this issue, this paper proposes a shared DC-bus multi-channel drive architecture for traveling-wave USM. In the proposed scheme, multiple half-bridge power stages are connected in parallel to a common high-voltage DC-bus to achieve centralized energy supply and distributed driving. A DC-side midpoint reference network is introduced to establish an AC voltage reference under a unipolar DC supply, while an independent series matching inductor is employed in each channel to shape the half-bridge output into a quasi-sinusoidal motor-terminal voltage through resonant filtering. Based on the equivalent electrical model of the USM, a unified analytical model is established to analyze the voltage formation mechanism under shared DC-bus conditions. Time-domain simulations and experimental tests are carried out on a two-channel prototype operating at a 150 V DC-bus and a 40 kHz switching frequency. The results demonstrate stable quasi-sinusoidal output voltages, preserved phase consistency, and limited inter-channel coupling during parallel operation. Compared with conventional independent-supply solutions, the proposed architecture achieves an approximately 27% reduction in overall system volume for a three-motor configuration, demonstrating good scalability for compact multi-channel USM drive systems.",

    "Abstract": "This in vitro study evaluated the effects of activated charcoal mouthwashes on the color stability and surface roughness of resin composites after long-term water aging and repolishing. One nanofilled (Filtek Universal) and two nanohybrid composites (Optishade Universal, Neo Spectra ST HV) were prepared as disks (n = 12/group). After baseline measurements, specimens were aged in water for 6 months (37 °C), immersed in Colgate Plax White+Charcoal, Natural Mouthwash Charcoal, or distilled water for 12 h, and then repolished. Color change was assessed using CIEDE2000 (ΔE00; acceptability threshold = 1.8) and surface roughness (Ra) by profilometry. Data were analyzed using three-way ANOVA (α = 0.05). Six-month aging caused clinically unacceptable discoloration in all materials (ΔE00 = 6.13–8.87). Charcoal mouthwashes produced partial color recovery, greater with Natural Mouthwash (ΔE00 = 2.85–3.20) than Colgate (ΔE00 = 4.20–5.85), though values remained above the clinical acceptability threshold. After repolishing, only Optishade-Colgate reached an acceptable color. Charcoal increased roughness (Ra = 0.168–0.195 µm), but repolishing restored near-baseline values. Overall, repolishing effectively recovered surface smoothness but provided only limited color recovery, with most materials remaining above clinically acceptable thresholds.",

    "Abstract": "Biospeckle imaging enables non-destructive observation of dynamic physiological activity in plant tissues; however, the relative sensitivity of different biospeckle activity maps to water stress and their implications for data-driven classification remain insufficiently understood. This study systematically evaluates multiple biospeckle activity mapping approaches for water stress analysis in maize (Zea mays L.) leaves and examines how their characteristics influence deep learning–based classification performance. Maize plants were subjected to three irrigation levels (0%, 50%, and 100%) over a 7-day experimental period. Stomatal conductance was measured as an independent physiological reference, and a microfluidic phantom experiment was conducted to verify the physical response behavior of the biospeckle imaging system. Temporal variations in biospeckle activity were statistically analyzed, followed by deep learning–based classification using representative two-dimensional convolutional neural network models. Statistical analysis revealed that biospeckle activity exhibited stress-dependent responses, with severe water stress (0%) being consistently distinguishable, whereas moderate and well-watered conditions (50% and 100%) showed partially overlapping patterns. These trends were consistent with stomatal conductance measurements. Deep learning models trained on different biospeckle activity maps achieved classification accuracies of up to 0.73 and macro-averaged F1 scores of 0.73, with notable differences in performance depending on the selected activity representation. These results suggest that while traditional statistical parameters show limited linearity, the proposed deep learning-based biospeckle analysis could serve as a useful tool for water stress classification. By capturing complex spatial-texture features, this study presents a potential data-driven approach for precision plant phenotyping.",

    "Abstract": "The continuous increase in electronic power densities demands thermal management solutions that surpass the conventional heat sink designs. This study introduces a synergistic approach that combines constructal design principles with Friction Stir Processing (FSP) to create next-generation heat sinks featuring an optimized geometry and locally enhanced thermal conductivity. Constructal design provides a physics-based framework for routing heat through preferential paths, whereas FSP enables the fabrication of these paths by refining the microstructure and reducing defect density, thereby improving thermal transport properties. Experimental validation on the AA6082-T651 aluminum alloy demonstrated a 21% increase in thermal conductivity within the FSP-processed regions, as confirmed through electrical resistivity measurements and thermal step-response tests. Microstructural analysis revealed significant grain refinement (from ~150 μm to 3–5 μm), which correlated with enhanced heat diffusion rates. A constructal scale-based model was developed to establish the relationship between the conductivity ratio and optimal geometric configuration, showing that a higher local conductivity shifts the design toward denser thermal pathways. These findings substantiate the feasibility of integrating geometry optimization with property tailoring, paving the way for scalable, high-efficiency heat sinks for advanced cooling systems.",

    "Abstract": "Adaptive winglets improve aerodynamic efficiency by enabling geometry adjustments tailored to flight conditions. In this study, an engineering-oriented optimization framework is developed and applied to numerical aerodynamic evaluations based on the wing–winglet configuration of a KC-135 aircraft, under representative takeoff, climb, and cruise conditions. A Plackett–Burman design is employed to screen the 10 kinds of winglet geometric parameters, from which the dominant variables affecting drag are identified. Subsequently, response surface methodology is used to construct surrogate models and determine optimal parameter combinations for each flight phase, thereby defining a feasible morphing envelope for adaptive winglet operation. The results indicate that a coupled morphing of winglet height and cant angle constitutes the most effective morphing mode. Across the takeoff, climb, and cruise phases, the optimal morphing envelope involves a continuous transition from Height = 0.20b/2 and Cant angle = 86.3° at takeoff, to Height = 0.192b/2 and Cant angle = 8.2° during climb, and finally approaching the baseline configuration (Height = 0.135b/2, Cant angle = 20°) at cruise, while achieving a maximum drag reduction efficiency improvement of up to 8.8% at the climb phase.",

    "Abstract": "Artificial neural networks are reliable machine learning models that have been applied to a multitude of practical and scientific applications in recent decades. Among these applications, there are examples from the areas of physics, chemistry, medicine, etc. To effectively apply them to these problems, it is necessary to adapt their parameters using optimization techniques. However, in order to be effective, optimization techniques must know the range of values for the parameters of the artificial neural network, so that they can adequately train the artificial neural network. In most cases, this is not possible, as these ranges are also significantly affected by the inputs to the artificial neural network from the objective problem it is called upon to solve. This situation usually results in artificial neural networks becoming trapped in local minima of the error function or, even worse, in the phenomenon of overfitting, where although the training error achieves low values, the artificial neural network exhibits low performance in the corresponding test set. To address this limitation, this work proposes a novel two-stage training approach in which a simulated annealing (SA)-based preprocessing stage is employed to automatically identify optimal parameter value intervals before the application of any optimization method to train the neural network. Unlike similar approaches that rely on fixed or heuristically selected parameter bounds, the proposed preprocessing technique explores the parameter space probabilistically, guided by a temperature-controlled acceptance mechanism that balances global exploration and local refinement. The proposed method has been successfully applied to a wide range of classification and regression problems and comparative results are presented in detail in the present work.",

    "Abstract": "A large number of transits have been observed by TESS from the rapidly orbiting exoplanet 55 Cancri e. This amount of transit data, combined with the relatively high frequency of TESS observations, allows for a direct measurement of not only the planetary radius and orbital parameters but also the limb darkening coefficients of the host star. We obtain a planetary radius of 1.64±0.10 earth radii, an orbital radius of 0.019±0.009 AU, and an orbital inclination of 85±17 degrees. For the quadratic limb darkening coefficients u1 and u2 we report measurements of u1=0.58±0.48 and u2=0.64±0.55, and discuss strategies to reduce the uncertainty in the measurement. We also measured the curvature of the transit depth as a function of time using an effective parametrization I′(t)=C(t2), and found C=0.28±0.03 in units of relative intensity per day squared. This parametrization resulted in a higher goodness-of-fit value than the quadratic model, with a reduced χ2 of 1.153 rather than 1.201 for the quadratic model, and a ΔBIC of 31.75 in favor of the effective parametrization.",

    "Abstract": "Acoustic precipitation enhancement (APE) is an emerging non-chemical weather-modification technique, yet quantitative three-dimensional evidence of its impact on rainy clouds remains scarce. This study investigates a stratiform precipitation event over the Bayinbuluke Basin in the central Tianshan Mountains of northwestern China, 29–30 August 2024, using an X-band phased-array weather radar (X-PAR) coordinated with an upward-directed acoustic source. Rapid volumetric scans and sector-aligned range-height indicators were combined to reconstruct the three-dimensional cloud structure before, during, and after acoustic operation. During acoustic operation, the results were stronger and more persistent than during the non-operation period, with localized values exceeding 40 dBZ. Within the 3 km influence zone, low-level reflectivity increased across all azimuthal sectors with clear directional dependence. Dual-ratio analysis showed statistically significant enhancement in the windward sector (247°, DR = 1.91, p = 0.0004) and the leeward sector (137°, DR = 1.51, p = 0.008), indicating that acoustic-induced responses extended beyond the primary radiation sector and propagated downstream with cloud advection. These results, based on a single stratiform precipitation case, demonstrate that volumetric X-PAR observations can detect localized cloud-structure responses during acoustic operation.",

    "Abstract": "Much of the information for studying the processes of lightning discharge initiation and development is provided by studying thundercloud radio emissions in various frequency bands. The High-Frequency (HF) band better corresponds to the characteristic scales of lightning development but has been undeservedly forgotten and is used quite rarely. Based on observations carried out in the Upper Volga region it is shown that the intensity of HF radio emissions from lightning is high enough to be reliably recorded in nearby thunderstorms. It is found that at all stages of lightning development the intensity of its radio emission in the HF band up to 10 MHz exceeds the average background intensity significantly. The amplitudes of lightning pulses exceed the background level more significantly, up to 60 dB and more. The feasibility of using the HF band for lightning observations including tracing the direction of arrival of a radio emission is clearly demonstrated.",

    "Abstract": "This paper develops an operator-oriented framework for spectral approximation in fractional calculus by introducing a fractional inner product defined through the Riemann-Liouville integral. Instead of modifying polynomial families, the proposed approach continuously deforms the underlying Hilbert space structure, with the fractional order α acting as a deformation parameter. A central theoretical result shows that this fractional inner product is mathematically equivalent to a classical weighted inner product with a deformed weight wα(x)=(b−x)α−1w(x). This equivalence establishes a rigorous connection between fractional calculus and classical orthogonal polynomial theory and clarifies the structural role of the fractional parameter. For a canonical one-dimensional setting, explicit recurrence relations are derived and the limiting behavior as α→1 is characterized, recovering the classical theory. The resulting orthogonal systems are naturally compatible with fractional operators and are used to construct spectral Galerkin methods for fractional differential equations. Well-posed variational formulations and optimal convergence rates are established. Numerical experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the framework, demonstrating spectral accuracy and improved performance in the approximation of fractional integrals and selected fractional differential equations when compared with standard polynomial bases. The proposed formulation provides a unifying operator-level perspective for spectral methods in fractional calculus.",

    "Abstract": "Functional data are nowadays routinely collected and stored in a wide variety of fields. Their adequate use and analysis are a challenge for the scientific community. Mathematically, each function can be understood as a sequence of infinite related numbers. Therefore, for statisticians, functional data can be read as a collection of a strongly correlated infinite-dimensional variable. Most existing statistical procedures have been adapted to functional data scenarios. In this manuscript, we are interested in understanding the use of functions for constructing adequate ROC curves and, therefore, for carrying out binary classifications. In particular, we consider the problem of studying the real capacity of functions derived from tissue doppler imaging (TDI) for identifying cardiac dysfunction related to cardiotoxicity therapy (CRTCD) in breast cancer women with high levels of the protein human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). With this goal, we use public and freely available data that has been already used for illustrating the use of functional data in the binary classification problem with very different take-home messages. This variability in the conclusions made us question the reproducibility of the results. Here, we explore five different functional approaches, and we think about the clinical use of the provided solutions and their potential overfitting. The main aim of this manuscript is identifying whether published results are excessively optimistic or if they adequately capture the actual capacity of TDI for accurately diagnostic CRTCD.",

    "Abstract": "Aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) represents a rich natural source of water, minerals, polysaccharides, vitamins, phenolic compounds and bioactive molecules that exert multiple health-promoting effects relevant to athletic performance. Its high content of water and minerals (magnesium, calcium, potassium) supports hydration and electrolyte balance during physical activity. At the same time, polysaccharides, especially acemannan, contribute to tissue regeneration, muscle recovery, immune modulation and gastrointestinal protection. Antioxidant compounds reduce exercise-induced oxidative stress, potentially improving recovery and limiting inflammatory damage. Aloe vera-based beverages, including leaf juices and fermented formulations, offer a practical and palatable vehicle for delivering these bioactives. In addition to supporting gut integrity and reducing symptoms such as reflux and heartburn, Aloe vera supplementation may enhance nutrient absorption and modulate glucose metabolism, contributing to better metabolic stability during exercise. The increasing commercial interest in natural functional beverages highlights the relevance of Aloe vera as a nutraceutical candidate for athletes. This review explores the multiple benefits of Aloe leaf derivatives, bridging traditional medicine and evidence-based applications for metabolic health (gastrointestinal comfort, hydration, antioxidant defence and post-exercise recovery). However, further clinical studies are needed to fully define dosage, efficacy and mechanisms of action.",

    "Abstract": "Handling dispersion of casein powders in water is widely encountered in the milk industry. However, in silico prediction of the apparent viscosity of these colloidal dispersions is not an easy task, especially when these micellar casein suspensions are highly concentrated, as in hyper-protein milk beverages, which are experiencing exponential market growth. In this work, Coarse-Grained (CG) models using Lennard-Jones potentials to model interactions were built for simulating rheological properties of colloidal micellar casein dispersions (native and demineralized). In a first approach, a polydisperse explicit CG model was developed. For this polydisperse CG model, the representation chain was composed of four large smooth spheres of different sizes mimicking the real distribution of casein colloids. The CG simulation results were validated by comparison with experimental rheological data for native colloidal casein dispersions. Both in-house experimental results and available data found in the literature were used for this purpose, covering a wide range of casein concentrations ([10 g/L–200 g/L], [8–20%] corresponding to casein concentration, colloid volume fraction and solid/liquid volume fraction, respectively). In a second approach, a simplified model using a monodisperse CG model was developed. This simplified model only included one type of soft sphere and was found to preserve the accuracy of the rheological prediction. Finally, a monodisperse CG model was set up to predict the behavior of demineralized micellar casein dispersions, for which a decrease in the average size of the micelle size distribution is observed when demineralization occurs. For all models, the comparison between the predicted and experimental rheological behavior is fully satisfactory, proving that the CG models proposed for casein-based micellar dispersions are physically well founded and that the proposed simplified representation chain, based on micelle size observation, makes sense.",

    "Abstract": "Kombucha’s growing popularity worldwide has been accompanied by a growing consumer interest in exploring new flavors and adopting healthier diets. In this preliminary consumer-driven study, we investigated the application of white hibiscus (WH) calyces in the development of novel kombucha beverages. Kombuchas were made from 100% black tea (BT), 100% WH, and 50% BT/WH blend infusions, then their pH, total titratable acidity (TTA), ethanol content, sucrose, glucose, and fructose concentrations were measured. Untrained sensory participants (N = 97) rated the kombuchas using a 9-point hedonic scale, described them using a check-all-that-apply list of attributes, and answered a willingness-to-pay (WTP) question. Tea infusion and fermentation time had a significant effect on pH, TTA, ethanol, sucrose, fructose, and glucose content (p &lt; 0.05). High residual sugar levels observed in the WH kombucha indicated sluggish fermentation. Kombuchas differed significantly in overall-liking, color, aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel liking, and WTP (p &lt; 0.05). Overall, BT kombucha was preferred over the WH kombuchas (100% and blend). Sensory attributes “refreshing”, “floral”, “hibiscus”, “fruity”, and “sweet” were positive drivers of acceptability, while “pungent” and “astringent” were negative drivers. Results suggest that blends containing less than 50% WH may provide more appealing sensory attributes to consumers, and that further study is needed.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The incorporation of botanical ingredients into craft beer has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance nutritional value and expand its sensory diversity. Thus, this review aims to discuss the impact of adding botanical extracts on the physicochemical properties, phenolic content, and antioxidant potential of craft beers. Methods: A narrative review was conducted using PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and b-on databases, with the keywords ‘craft beer’, ‘physicochemical properties’, ‘polyphenolic content’, and ‘antioxidant activity’. Results: The incorporation of botanical ingredients into beers modified the physicochemical parameters, total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant activity. These effects varied according to the type of matrix, concentration, timing of addition, beer style, and brewing conditions. Overall, an increase in beer TPC and antioxidant activity was observed. However, higher TPC can present technological challenges, as phenolic–protein interaction may lead to turbidity. Conversely, enhanced antioxidant potential contributes to oxidative stability and extends the shelf-life of beer. Conclusions: Future studies should validate the current results, explore new bioactive matrices, and evaluate variables that ensure the functional quality of beer. Practical applications under real production conditions should also be prioritized to guarantee effective functional benefits without compromising the stability and sensory acceptance of craft beer.",

    "Abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 are widely used in the treatment of several cancers and have significantly improved survival outcomes in responsive patients. However, a substantial proportion of patients fail to benefit from these therapies, underscoring the urgent need for accurate prediction of ICI response. We propose a deep learning framework, ICIsc, to accurately predict ICI response by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data with protein large language models. Specifically, patient representations are constructed using transcriptomic profiles and immune-related gene set scores as latent embedding features, while drug representations are derived from amino acid sequences of ICI encoded by the Evolutionary Scale Modeling 2 (ESM2). For bulk data, ICIsc employs a bilinear attention module to fuse patient and drug embeddings for response prediction. For scRNA-seq data, ICIsc infers cell–cell interactions using a single-sample network (SSN) approach and applies GATv2 to model immune microenvironment heterogeneity at the single-cell level. Benchmark evaluations and independent validation demonstrate that ICIsc consistently outperforms baseline models and exhibits robust generalization performance. SHAP-based interpretability analysis further identifies key genes (e.g., GAPDH) associated with immunotherapy response and patient prognosis. Overall, ICIsc provides an accurate and interpretable framework for predicting immunotherapy outcomes and elucidating underlying mechanisms.",

Consequently, reduced testosterone levels may disrupt these processes and contribute to male infertility. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of low testosterone levels on semen parameters, sperm DNA fragmentation, and chromatin condensation; (2) Methods: This was a prospective study that included 214 men aged 25–45 years undergoing infertility evaluation. Participants were classified into two groups according to serum testosterone levels: low testosterone and normal testosterone. Total testosterone was determined using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Semen analysis was carried out according to the WHO 2021 guidelines. The DNA fragmentation index was assessed using the TUNEL assay. The sperm decondensation index was evaluated by aniline blue staining; (3) Results: Men with low serum total testosterone levels (&lt;2.64 ng/mL) exhibited significantly impaired semen parameters compared with those with normal testosterone levels. Serum total testosterone was positively correlated with sperm concentration (rs = 0.43, p &lt; 0.001), total motility (rs = 0.20, p = 0.005), normal morphology (rs = 0.25, p &lt; 0.001), and sperm vitality (rs = 0.173, p = 0.014). In contrast, testosterone levels were negatively correlated with the DNA fragmentation index (rs = −0.221, p = 0.0017) and the chromatin decondensation index (rs = −0.19, p = 0.0086). A higher proportion of pathological DFI (&gt;15%) was observed in the low testosterone group.

    "Abstract": "Background. Inbred mouse models of autoimmune myocarditis are routinely used to investigate the immune mechanisms underlying dilated cardiomyopathy. However, their translational relevance is limited because observations made in a single inbred strain may not reflect those of outbred human populations. This limitation can be overcome by using Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, whose genetic variability is comparable to that of humans. Methods. To investigate the utility of DO mice, we characterized their immune cell distributions and induced myocarditis by immunization with porcine cardiac myosin (PCM) emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant. Antigen-specific T cell and antibody responses were evaluated using lymphocytes and serum samples, respectively, and hearts were examined histologically for inflammatory changes. Results. First, we noted no significant variations in the majority of immune cell populations, which include T cells and B cells. However, NK cells, double positive for CD49b and NK1.1, were lacking in both sexes. While we noted sex differences in the expression of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules in antigen-presenting cells, expression of costimulatory molecules was similar in both sexes. Second, upon immunization, we demonstrated that the PCM was immunogenic, and the PCM-reactive T cell responses were generated in both males and females, as measured by a proliferation assay. Third, cytokine analysis revealed marginal detection of Th1 (IFN-γ) and Th17 (IL-17 and IL-22) cytokines, mainly with three doses of immunization. Fourth, determination of PCM-reactive antibody responses revealed significant amounts of IgG1 and IgG2b isotypes. Finally, histological analysis revealed varying degrees of myocarditis in individual mice of both sexes. Conclusions. Our data suggest that mild autoimmune myocarditis can be induced in DO mice. However, to capture the heterogeneity in disease susceptibility, large sample cohorts are required.",

    "Abstract": "Starvation elicits profound metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle, enabling survival during nutrient scarcity. While global proteomic changes underpinning muscle atrophy have been studied, the role of lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb), a novel metabolite-derived post-translational modification linked to ketone metabolism, remains largely unexplored. In this study, we subjected mice to 72 h of food deprivation and performed integrative quantitative proteomics and Kbhb-modified peptide profiling on gastrocnemius muscle. Starvation induced significant body weight and muscle mass loss, accompanied by increased systemic β-hydroxybutyrate levels and widespread Kbhb modification of muscle proteins. Proteomic analysis revealed extensive downregulation of ribosomal and translation-associated proteins, coupled with upregulation of autophagy and lipid catabolism pathways, highlighting a coordinated shift from anabolic processes to catabolic and oxidative metabolism. Deep Kbhb profiling identified over 7500 modified lysine sites across 2000 proteins, with starvation triggering a global increase in Kbhb on key metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis, TCA cycle, fatty acid β-oxidation, and amino acid metabolism. Notably, starvation-enhanced Kbhb preferentially targeted evolutionarily conserved lysines proximal to catalytic or cofactor-binding domains, implicating a regulatory role in enzymatic activity modulation. Conversely, Kbhb on structural and contractile proteins was downregulated, suggesting functional reprioritization of muscle physiology during fasting. Our findings uncover lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation as a dynamic, metabolically responsive PTM mediating gastrocnemius muscle adaptation to energy deficiency, expanding the paradigm of potentially metabolite-driven epigenetic and non-epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in muscle metabolism.",

    "Abstract": "Behavioral regulation in elite combat sports relies on traits such as anxiety, impulsivity, and personality, which are partly shaped by dopaminergic signaling. However, integrative approaches linking multidimensional behavioral profiles with genetic variability in athletes remain limited. This study aimed to identify distinct psychological profiles in elite combat athletes and examine whether these profiles differ in selected dopaminergic gene polymorphisms. A total of 200 male Polish elite combat athletes completed validated questionnaires assessing personality, anxiety, impulsivity, attention-related symptoms, and hedonic capacity. Standardized psychological variables were analyzed using a two-step clustering procedure. Genotype distributions were compared across clusters using chi-square tests. The clusters showed clear behavioral differentiation. Cluster 1 demonstrated higher anxiety, impulsivity, neuroticism, and attention-related symptoms. Cluster 2 showed lower anxiety and impulsivity alongside higher extraversion and conscientiousness. Cluster 3 displayed intermediate behavioral characteristics but the most distinctive genotype pattern. These findings suggest that combining behavioral clustering with genetic data may help characterize meaningful neurogenetic profiles in elite athletes and provide hypothesis-generating insights into genotype–phenotype relationships.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the potential of tomato waste (TW) and hot pepper waste (HPW) biomass from local food industries in Algeria as sustainable feedstocks for fluidized-bed air gasification. Conversion efficiency, syngas composition and energy content were evaluated under different operating conditions, including gasification temperature (750 and 850 °C) and bed material (silica sand, olivine, and a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst/silica sand mixture). The results demonstrate that gasification of these biomasses in a bubbling fluidized-bed reactor is an effective waste-valorization route, producing a syngas rich in hydrogen and methane, suitable for power generation and biofuel applications. Under all operating conditions, hot pepper waste generated a syngas with higher energy content than tomato pomace.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: The calf muscles are vital for generating propulsive force during walking. This power is produced from calf muscle contractions and elastic strain energy release. However, the impact of walking speed on these power-generation mechanisms is understudied. This study aimed to investigate how different walking speeds affect calf muscle activation and ankle power generation. Methods: In this study, we analyzed electromyography (EMG) signals from the gastrocnemius (GAS) and soleus (SOL) muscles of 55 healthy individuals walking at various speeds. C1: household ambulators (0–0.4 m·s−1), C2: limited community ambulators (0.4–0.8 m·s−1), C3: community ambulators (0.8–1.2 m·s−1), C4: self-selected usual speed, and C5: self-selected fast speed. Results: Deviating from a participant’s self-chosen pace led to increased cumulative muscle activity and prolonged plantar flexor activation. Optimal muscle activation was observed at speeds between 0.8–1.2 m·s−1. A second-degree polynomial mixed model best captured the relationship between muscle activation duration and integrated EMG in the ankle power generation phase in late stance, demonstrating the nonlinear relationship between walking speed and calf muscle activation in this phase. Statistically significant models (p &lt; 0.001) explained over 50% of the variability in GAS activation duration (R2 = 0.55) and integrated EMG (R2 = 0.56), as well as SOL activation duration (R2 = 0.52) and integrated EMG (R2 = 0.72). Conclusions: The nonlinear relationship between walking speed and calf muscle activation indicates that normal walking speed optimizes the utilization of elastic strain energy in the ankle power generation phase.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Comparing biological properties among related proteins has traditionally benefited research in areas such as biomedicine, phylogeny and evolution. Moreover, these kinds of properties have significantly increased as a result of the development of open-access resources and databases. In this context, the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) methods continue to be extensively applied to compare protein sequences and to identify evolutionarily conserved regions. Methods: In this work, we present INPROF, a novel web server designed to centralize and automate the computation of a large collection of features derived from protein sequences. This tool allows us to deeply analyze protein relationships and their conserved information by comparing them through their MSA. Specifically, this platform computes up to 46 different metrics including information at several proteomic levels (categories) like sequences, structures, domains or ontological terms. INPROF was designed to enable bioinformaticians and researchers to create a complete catalogue of features for subsequent prediction and artificial intelligence modeling based on proteins. The INPROF web server and source code are freely available. Results: INPROF were validated by predicting disease’s severity in several RNA-Seq datasets from COVID-19 patients. Specifically, INPROF were extracted from canonical proteins related to differentially expressed genes. Classification performance proved that INPROF were able to accurately classify COVID-19 severity, even outperforming classical classification with expression data. Conclusions: INPROF web server is a flexible platform designed to compute 46 quantitative metrics describing protein interactions which provide biologically meaningful characteristics applicable to downstream classification and prediction algorithms.",

    "Abstract": "Myriapods achieve remarkable obstacle-crossing capability through inter-segment pitch adjustment and coordinated anterior–posterior propulsion, providing valuable biomimetic inspiration for engineering design. Articulated tracked vehicles, connecting front and rear units via pitch mechanisms, exhibit functional similarity to myriapod body segments. This study develops a comprehensive dynamic model for articulated tracked vehicle pitch motion to reveal its biomimetic connection with myriapod locomotion. A quadratic-function-based non-uniform track–ground contact pressure distribution method with zero-gradient boundary conditions is proposed, effectively eliminating the non-physical negative pressure issue inherent in traditional assumptions. Systematic analyses reveal that the front unit provides primary traction under pitch-up conditions, forming a front-pulling-rear driving mode, while the rear unit dominates under pitch-down and acceleration conditions, forming a rear-pushing-front driving mode. Through pitch attitude adjustment, the maximum surmountable vertical-wall height increased from 263 to 593 mm, representing a 125.45% improvement. This traction distribution pattern closely matches the anterior-guidance and posterior-propulsion mechanism observed in myriapod locomotion. This study quantitatively validates the functional analogy between articulated tracked vehicle pitch dynamics and myriapod inter-segment coordination, providing theoretical foundations for bio-inspired tracked vehicle design.",

    "Abstract": "Forensic DNA profiling commonly relies on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) or massively parallel sequencing (MPS), which requires expensive, laboratory-based equipment that depends on a stable power supply and is unsuitable for field applications. Here, we present a proof-of-concept assay that uses recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) combined with exo probe detection for rapid, isothermal genotyping of insertion–deletion (InDel) markers. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first demonstration of forensic DNA typing using RPA coupled with exo probes. The reaction proceeds at 39 °C and combines amplification and detection in a single 20 min step. Thirteen DNA samples were genotyped in triplicate across eight InDel loci using allele-specific fluorescent probes. Genotypes were derived from differential endpoint fluorescence between matched and mismatched probes. Compared with benchmark genotyping, 97.07% of genotypes (n = 307) were correct at 1 ng DNA input. Accurate profiles were reliably obtained for DNA inputs as low as 250 pg, and partial profiles were still detectable at 31 pg. The results demonstrate that RPA-based InDel genotyping is fast, sensitive, and reproducible. With further optimization, such as refined probe design and selection of robust loci, the assay has clear potential to achieve complete accuracy and to be integrated into portable lab-on-a-chip platforms for rapid, field-deployable forensic identification.",

    "Abstract": "Many cemeteries include large amounts of greenspace and so have substantial potential to support urban plant and wildlife communities. However, the physical structure and design of these human-focused greenspaces may ultimately determine which species successfully inhabit these areas. Here, I studied the relationship between grave markers, a unique and ubiquitous feature of cemeteries that vary widely in shape and structure within and between burial areas, and the behavior of cemetery avian communities. I hypothesized that areas with greater structural heterogeneity of markers would be used by a larger diversity of species and that species would alter their behavior and interactions with markers based on marker structure. I assessed avian abundance and species richness in areas with varied upright and homogenously flat grave markers and observed behaviors exhibited by four common species in relation to grave markers and other structural features. While I found no relationship between grave marker heterogeneity and avian species richness or abundance, there is evidence for species-specific behavior and interactions with grave markers, suggesting that marker design is an important and relevant landscape feature for birds. These results have practical applications for cemetery design at a time when there is both increased public interest in environmentally friendly burials and growing competition for land in increasingly heavily developed urban areas.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Neuromuscular fatigue (NMF) can impair manual dexterity and strength in healthcare professionals. Due to their high physical and cognitive workloads, physiotherapists (PTs) are particularly susceptible to NMF. This study investigated whether NMF, expressed as changes in manual dexterity and grip strength, occurs over a workday and across a workweek in PTs, and explored its relationship with stress and sleep quality. Methods: A total of 43 full-time PTs (25 female, mean age 37.72 ± 11.94 years) were recruited. Manual dexterity was assessed using the Functional Dexterity Test (FDT), while maximal grip strength (MGS) was measured by a hand dynamometer. Reliability was evaluated on a subgroup using Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC3,1) and Standard Error of Measurement (SEM). Evaluations were conducted at the beginning and at the end of the work shift, on Monday and Friday. Subjective fatigue, perceived stress, and sleep quality were also recorded. Results: The FDT showed excellent intra-rater reliability (ICC &gt; 0.93; SEM &lt; 0.94 s). FDT performance was significantly slower on Friday evening compared to all other time points (p &lt; 0.01), exceeding the minimal detectable change thresholds. No significant changes were observed in MGS across the week. Perceived stress was strongly correlated with fatigue levels on Monday (ρ = 0.731) and Friday (ρ = 0.612) evenings. Sleep quality and professional experience did not correlate with performance changes. Conclusions: PTs experience a significant decline in manual dexterity by the end of the workweek, suggesting an accumulation of NMF. While MGS remains stable, fine motor control is more sensitive to fatigue. Psychosocial stress appears to be a major driver of perceived fatigue in this population.",

    "Abstract": "The prediction of chiller performance parameters is crucial for optimal control and fault diagnosis. Numerous efficient and accurate data-driven models have been developed and implemented. These models are normally trained on historical operational data of chiller units. However, the distribution of operational data may shift due to accumulated operating hours or changes in control strategies. Under new operating conditions, models trained on historical data often generalize poorly, leading to prediction deviations. To address this issue, this study integrates a one-dimensional convolutional neural network with a domain adaptation method that extracts features from both the source and target domains and aligns their inverse Gram matrices in terms of angle and scale. A predictive model applicable to multiple chiller performance parameters is established using limited historical data, enhancing the model’s generalization ability. Compared to the baseline model (MLP), the proposed method achieves an average reduction of 74.3% in mean absolute error (MAE) and 76.1% in root mean square error (RMSE), while the R2 values exceed 0.96 (for certain scenarios). Additionally, this paper analyzes the data distribution between the source and target domains, investigates key factors affecting the model’s generalization capability, and provides insights for evaluating the quality of modeling data.",

    "Abstract": "The use of recycled materials as internal curing (IC) agents offers substantial benefits to the concrete industry by improving performance and enhancing environmental sustainability. However, the design of IC concrete has grown intricate due to the nonlinear interactions among many input variables. Previous research on IC is mostly experimental, with only a few studies focusing on predicting the compressive strength (CS) of IC concrete. In particular, machine learning has not been applied to quantify the effect of roof-tile waste (RTW) on the CS of IC concrete. This research presents an innovative hybrid model that combines random forest and particle swarm optimization (RF-PSO) to predict the CS of IC concrete using RTW as an IC aggregate. Before model building, a comparative analysis of potential methodologies was conducted, highlighting the key characteristics, benefits, and drawbacks. RF-PSO was then chosen, achieving enhanced accuracy with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.961, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.361 MPa, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.001 MPa. The RF-PSO model improved prediction accuracy by increasing R2 from 0.906 to 0.961 and reducing statistical errors by nearly 30% compared with conventional machine learning models. A Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was performed to interpret the model results. The analysis identified the water-to-cement ratio and curing age as the dominant predictors, while IC water contributed a secondary, age-dependent effect. The proposed framework makes contributions: it integrates SHAP-based interpretability into a high-accuracy RF-PSO model and provides a viable tool for reducing empirical trial mixes in sustainable design workflows. Despite the limited dataset, the findings provide a reproducible baseline for future expansion and highlight the potential of combining RTW with IC to improve early and long-term strength.",

    "Abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) rearrangements represent one of the most actionable molecular alterations in biliary tract cancer, particularly in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (iCCA). Approximately 10–16% of iCCA cases harbor FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements, defining a distinct molecular subtype characterized by sensitivity to FGFR-targeted therapies. Selective FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including the reversible inhibitor pemigatinib and the irreversible inhibitor futibatinib, have demonstrated clinically meaningful response rates and durable disease control in patients with previously treated FGFR2-altered iCCA, leading to regulatory approvals and the incorporation of FGFR inhibition into contemporary treatment paradigms. However, the development of acquired resistance—most commonly driven by secondary kinase-domain mutations and activation of bypass signaling pathways—remains a major limitation to sustained therapeutic benefit. This review summarizes the biological basis of FGFR2 alterations, highlights current clinical evidence supporting FGFR inhibition, and discusses the evolving landscape of resistance mechanisms. We further examine emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming resistance, including next-generation FGFR inhibitors and rational combination approaches. In addition, we highlight the growing role of circulating tumor DNA as a noninvasive tool for longitudinal molecular monitoring and treatment guidance. Together, these insights underscore the central role of FGFR2-directed therapy in precision oncology for biliary tract cancer and provide a framework for optimizing and extending targeted treatment in this molecularly defined disease subset.",

    "Abstract": "Background: In high-risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), adjuvant therapies, such as intravesical Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) instillation, are widely employed; however, BCG treatment poses challenges due to potential adverse effects and ongoing supply limitations. This study aimed to evaluate treatment patterns, therapeutic efficacy, incidence of adverse events, and clinical predictors of recurrence and progression in patients with high-grade pT1 urothelial carcinoma (HG-T1 UC) of the bladder. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 204 patients diagnosed with HG-pT1 UC who underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) at Toho University Sakura Medical Center between 2010 and 2021. Clinical data encompassing treatment modalities (BCG or intravesical chemotherapy), complications, and oncological outcomes were collected. Recurrence-Free Survival (RFS), Progression-Free Survival, and Cancer-Specific Survival were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier analyses and multivariate regression models. Results: Maintenance BCG therapy was significantly associated with prolonged RFS compared to other treatments, including among ‘very high-risk’ patients. However, 52.4% of patients receiving BCG maintenance experienced adverse events, with dose reductions required in 59% of cases. Notably, recurrence rates did not significantly differ based on dose reduction or the total number of BCG instillations. Tumor multiplicity emerged as an independent risk factor for recurrence. Conclusions: Although maintenance BCG therapy remains essential for managing HG-T1 UC, especially in high-risk patients, treatment should be individualized due to concerns about tolerability and availability. The study results support the importance of personalized strategies based on risk stratification as outlined in clinical guidelines for preventing recurrence in NMIBC.",

We sought to expand the implementation of in-house NGS at our community-based academic cancer center to operationalize the utilization of molecular diagnostic studies to optimize cancer care for all patients, including those outside this study, through broader adoption and diffusion. Methods: In this prospective IRB-approved study, the Kellogg Cancer Genomic Initiative (KCGI), patients with advanced cancers underwent in-house NGS, including tumor mutational burden (TMB) and pharmacogenomics. In-house bioinformatics (Flype) was used for structured reporting and served as a molecular knowledgebase. A multidisciplinary molecular tumor board (MTB) was created to provide precision therapy recommendations. Results: In-house NGS, completed within 11 business days on average, was performed in 90% (251) of the 279 patients in the KCGI with advanced cancers. RNA and TMB analyses were successful in 89.2% and 86.5% of patients, respectively. A total of 54.2% of patients were identified as candidates for use of on- or off-label FDA-approved therapies, and 99.6% of patients who underwent pharmacogenomics testing had at least one gene alteration associated with medication dose adjustment/avoidance. An MTB was established to discuss these and other molecularly challenging cases continues to function as a consultative service that provides actionable recommendations. Conclusions: In this real-world trial, the utilization of in-house NGS with an adaptable bioinformatics pipeline and the establishment of an MTB enabled the refinement of institutional processes and created an environment that enhanced clinician interest in genomics and improved genomics-guided care for patients with advanced cancers.",

The hydrogenation results showed that the Pd-only catalyst (catalyst-1) performed best on most substrates. In contrast, catalysts with only Cu or with Pd-Cu bimetallic showed no catalytic activity. The study discusses the effects of Pd incorporation and the Pd-Cu synergistic effect on catalyst stability, highlighting potential limitations in active-site stability and suggesting ways to enhance catalyst longevity. Overall, this research reveals that lignin is a promising, renewable support for catalysts, offering alternatives to traditional supports. These findings provide valuable insights into improving lignin modification and developing eco-friendly catalytic processes aligned with green chemistry principles.",

    "Abstract": "Focal adhesions (FAs) are critical multi-protein complexes regulating cell adhesion, migration, and survival, and their dysregulation contributes to cancer metastasis and vascular diseases. Despite extensive research on FA formation, little is known about FA turnover, particularly its regulation by autophagy. This study introduces a novel tandem fluorescence reporter capable of tracking the entire FA-phagy flux, from autophagosome formation to lysosomal degradation. The reporter, based on a red–green fluorescence system with a lysosome-specific cleavage site, integrates seamlessly into endogenous focal adhesion complexes, demonstrating sensitivity and specificity to autophagy stimuli. Validated in multiple cell lines, the tool revealed dynamic FA-phagy responses to starvation-induced autophagy and the involvement of autophagy regulators such as mTOR and ATG genes. This versatile reporter provides a powerful tool for investigating FA-phagy mechanisms, with significant implications for cancer biology and vascular research.",

    "Abstract": "Natural plant-based resources are rich in bioactive compounds that offer promising alternatives for developing sustainable, functional textiles. This study focuses on the extraction and application of natural dyes from Gardenia jasminoides as an eco-friendly substitute for conventional synthetic dyes. The dye was extracted using methanol–water (50:50) and ethanol–water (50:50) solvent systems, alongside conventional aqueous extraction, followed by characterization through column chromatography. The characterization of the extracted powders confirmed the presence of gardenia yellow pigments with strong coloration potential. Among the tested extraction methods, ultrasonic-assisted methanol–water extraction (M.W.U.) exhibited the highest dye yield of 29.5%, followed by ethanol–water ultra-sound extraction (E.W.U.) at 24.9%, water ultrasound extraction (W.U.) at 18.35%, and the lowest yield obtained from the water-heater method (W.H.) at 18.25%. The dyed cotton fabrics were tested for color strength (K/S), CIELAB, colorfastness (washing, light, rubbing), and functional properties (antibacterial and vector protection) according to standard operating procedures. The results revealed that an optimal mordant concentration produced the maximum color strength (K/S = 1.7730), with good rubbing (4–5), washing (4–5), and light fastness (5). The dyed fabrics also exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, as evaluated by the AATCC 100 test method. For instance, the vector protection property of the cotton dyed fabrics was also excellent, as confirmed by the cage test. Overall, the use of Gardenia jasminoides seed-based natural dye demonstrates not only desirable coloration and functional performance but also significant ecological advantages, reducing chemical pollution and supporting the transition toward environmentally sustainable textile processing.",

    "Abstract": "Background: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of infraocclusion in primary molars, its distribution according to age, gender, and location, dental anomalies associated with infraocclusion, radiographic findings related to infraocclusion, and treatments applied to affected teeth. Methods: A total of 8452 digital panoramic radiographs of children aged 7–11 years (2019–2022) were retrospectively evaluated for infraocclusion of primary molars. Radiographs were assessed by calibrated examiners, and infraocclusion severity was classified according to the Brearley and McKibben system. The presence of permanent successors, applied treatments, and associated dental and radiographic findings were recorded. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests (SPSS 28.0). Results: Infraocclusion was most frequently observed in mandibular second primary molars and was most prevalent at the age of 9. The majority of cases were mild (49.5%), followed by moderate (29.8%) and severe (20.7%). A significant correlation was found between infraocclusion severity and radiographic findings such as adjacent tooth tipping, supraeruption of opposing teeth, and eruption disturbances of permanent successors (p &lt; 0.05). A statistically significant relationship was also observed between infraocclusion severity and treatment modality (p &lt; 0.05). As infraocclusion severity increased, restorative treatment decreased and extraction rates increased. In 10.3% of cases, no permanent successor was present beneath the affected tooth. Dens invaginatus and hypodontia were the most commonly associated dental anomalies. The overall prevalence of infraocclusion was 3.6%, with no significant gender difference (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: Although infraocclusion is relatively uncommon in primary molars, the present findings highlight its frequent associations with dental anomalies and variations in permanent successor presence. These results emphasise the importance of careful radiographic evaluation and follow-up in children with infraoccluded primary molars. Future longitudinal studies are needed to better understand the aetiology and progression of infraocclusion.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) is a leading non-genetic cause of childhood sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), characterized by heterogeneous and dynamic hearing outcomes. Hearing impairment may be present at birth or emerge later in childhood. This study aimed to characterize hearing trajectories and laterality patterns in children with cCMV, with emphasis on congenital versus delayed-onset SNHL. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of children with confirmed cCMV who underwent longitudinal audiologic follow-up. Hearing loss was classified as congenital SNHL or delayed-onset SNHL. Better- and poorer-ear thresholds, bilateral involvement, longitudinal changes, and follow-up duration were analyzed. Results: Of 195 included children, 59 (30%) developed SNHL. Congenital SNHL was present in 34 children (17%), while delayed-onset SNHL developed in 25 of 161 children (16%) who were born with normal hearing. Of these delayed-onset cases, 20 (80%) were asymptomatic at birth, while 5 (20%) presented with non-audiological neonatal symptoms. Longitudinal observation of the delayed-onset subgroup revealed that 36 ears developed SNHL during follow-up, spanning infancy through later childhood, including one case identified in early adulthood. Better-ear thresholds were significantly better preserved in delayed-onset SNHL, while poorer-ear thresholds were comparable across groups. Children with SNHL had substantially longer follow-up duration (60 ± 44.5 months) compared with those with normal hearing (37 ± 24.4 months). Conclusions: Children with cCMV-related SNHL exhibit dynamic and asymmetric hearing trajectories with clinically relevant differences between congenital and delayed-onset SNHL. These findings underscore the necessity of a risk-stratified, long-term surveillance framework that ensures individualized long-term monitoring and promotes sustained adherence to follow-up.",

    "Abstract": "Occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) and mutated forms of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) represent diagnostic challenges, especially in individuals with atypical serological profiles. This study explores the molecular characteristics of HBV in HBsAg-negative women of childbearing age exhibiting atypical serological markers. We selected 100 HBsAg-negative sera from a cohort of 433 women aged 15–45 years. Additional HBV serological markers (anti-HBc, anti-HBs, HBeAg, anti-HBe) were assessed. Real-time PCR targeting the HBV S gene was performed on samples presenting atypical profiles. Socio-demographic and clinical correlates were also analyzed. Atypical serological profiles were identified in 23% of HBsAg-negative women, including combinations such as isolated anti-HBe positivity and anti-HBe with anti-HBc. Among these, none tested positive for HBV DNA by real-time PCR. Atypical profiles were more prevalent among women attending antenatal consultations and those aged under 25 years. The absence of detectable HBV DNA suggests either very low viral loads, resolved past infections, or serological artifacts due to mutated HBV strains. The high frequency of atypical serological patterns among HBsAg-negative women underscores the need to refine molecular diagnostic tools for detecting occult or mutated HBV. Further sequencing and genotypic characterization studies are warranted.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Ledderhose Disease, or plantar fibromatosis, is a fibroproliferative disorder affecting the plantar fascia with limited effective treatment options. Although hyaluronidase has a long history of clinical use, it has not been previously used for Ledderhose Disease. This study explores the use of combined hyaluronidase and triamcinolone acetonide enzymatic injections as a novel and promising technique for managing Ledderhose Disease. Methods: This paper investigates the use of combination therapy with hyaluronidase, triamcinolone acetonide, and lidocaine injections in three patients with Ledderhose Disease. Injection protocols, dosage, frequency, and patient outcomes are all discussed. Additionally, this study explores the underlying mechanisms of hyaluronidase action in Ledderhose Disease, shedding light on its potential to modulate fibrotic tissue and alleviate symptoms. Results: All three patients treated with a series of hyaluronidase, triamcinolone acetonide, and lidocaine anesthetic injections experienced either a significant reduction in or elimination of nodules and associated pain within 6 weeks after initial injection. Patients were asymptomatic at two years follow-up after injections. Conclusions: The combination of hyaluronidase and triamcinolone acetonide injections significantly decreased pain and softened fibromas faster than triamcinolone acetonide injection alone, as explored in previous studies. Large prospective studies are needed to further compare enzymatic injection therapies in the management of Ledderhose Disease.",

The influence of the modification of the silane-based layer by the incorporation of 3-aminopropyl trimethoxysilane (APS) doped TiO2 (N-TiO2) on the pitting properties of the coatings has been studied. The obtained protective films have been characterized from compositional (EDX), morphological (FE-SEM), and electrochemical (corrosion) points of view. Concerning their morphology, the coatings look continuous and smooth. Regarding their electrochemical properties, the results show that the application of the developed N-TiO2-containing silane coatings extends the passive potential range of 316L stainless steel in simulated body fluid; thus, it improves the pitting resistance of the substrate.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Otoplasty is a commonly performed cosmetic ear procedure, yet patient-reported outcome data remain limited. This study analyzes otoplasty reviews on RealSelf, a widely used aesthetic review platform that provides insight into patient experiences and outcomes. Methods: A retrospective review of otoplasty-related posts on RealSelf from January 2009 to March 2025 was performed. Reviews were manually screened and coded independently by reviewers. Extracted variables included demographics, procedure location, surgeon specialty, anesthesia type, postoperative pain, satisfaction rating (“Worth It,” “Not Worth It,” “Not Sure”), cost, motivations for surgery, and reasons for choosing the surgeon. Results: A total of 615 reviews met inclusion criteria, and 90.7% rated the procedure as “Worth It.” Protruding ears were the most common motivation for surgery (55.1%), followed by ear asymmetry (17.0%). Surgeon selection was most influenced by the consultation experience (34.4%), credentials (24.8%), and online reviews (21.6%). Positive surgeon comments emphasized comfort (32.3%), personality (27.9%), and communication (25.1%). Satisfaction was significantly associated with postoperative pain level (p &lt; 0.001) and improved confidence after surgery (p = 0.032), but not with age, gender, procedure location, anesthesia type, or cost. Improved confidence (38.5%), enhanced ear shape (27.8%), and natural-appearing results (17.4%) were the most frequently cited reasons for being satisfied with otoplasty. Conclusion: Patient-reported satisfaction with otoplasty on RealSelf is high and is associated with favorable aesthetic results, improved self-confidence, and positive surgeon–patient interactions. In this cohort, effective communication, realistic expectation setting, and postoperative pain management were central to optimizing the patient experience.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the molecular interactions and interfacial behaviors of a carboxylate-sulfonate gemini surfactant (CSGS) with four heavy-oil components (SARA: saturates, aromatics, resins, and asphaltenes) using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. To provide a comprehensive analysis, two distinct systems were constructed: a homogeneous bulk oil phase (System 1) and a solid–liquid interfacial system containing a calcite (CaCO3) substrate (System 2). In System 1, results showed that CSGS remained well dispersed in the bulk heavy-oil phase and promoted a more uniform distribution of the SARA components. The differences in mobility among the components were mainly determined by molecular structure, resulting in a consistent diffusion trend in the CSGS-containing bulk system. In contrast, the introduction of a calcite substrate (System 2) shifted the distribution from a largely disordered bulk-like state to a confined interfacial organization, with clear layering and enrichment near the mineral surface. Compared with the CaCO3-free system, molecular migration was noticeably restricted, indicating that the carbonate layer imposed additional constraints on mass transport. At the same time, CSGS preferentially accumulated in the SARA components–CaCO3 region, consistent with competitive adsorption at the carbonate interface, and further reorganized the local interfacial structure.",

The physicochemical processes of SnO2 crystallization in water–alcohol solutions of SnCl2 were analyzed depending on the concentration of the crystallization initiator NH4F and the alcohols used. The sol–gel processing of the thin films was investigated using a Latin square approach. Three factors affecting the film formation conditions were varied at three levels to determine the best combination of film properties involving the maximum transparency and lowest specific electrical resistance. The effect of solvent type (ethanol, 1-butanol and isopropanol), the amount of introduced fluorine (5, 10, and 15 at. %) and the number of deposited layers (10, 15, and 20) on the composition, morphology, crystallization features, transparency and specific surface resistance of the synthesized thin films was studied. The obtained films of ~200–340 nm thickness exhibited ~78%–95% transparency in the visible spectrum range and specific surface resistance (ρs) from ~109 to &gt;1012 Ω/sq. The optimal combination of thin (~250 μm) SnO2&lt;Sn&gt; film target performances including transparency 84% and specific surface resistance ~109 Ω/sq. was achieved in the case of their preparation in isopropanol with an average concentration of NH4F (10 at. % F) and spin-on deposition of 20 layers.",

    "Abstract": "Herein, a cobalt–molybdenum bimetallic oxide precursor was synthesized via a hydrothermal route, followed by a phosphidation strategy in a tube furnace to produce a CoMoP cocatalyst. Subsequently, a CoMoP/BiVO4 composite photoanode was successfully constructed by loading the CoMoP cocatalyst onto the surface of an electrodeposited BiVO4 film using a drop-casting method. A suite of analytical tools such as TEM, XRD, and XPS was utilized to comprehensively examine the material morphology and crystalline features, verifying that CoMoP was effectively anchored on the BiVO4 surface with intimate interfacial contact. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance testing indicated that the composite photoanode achieved optimal performance with a 200 µL loading of the CoMoP dispersion (2 mg/mL). Under front-side illumination, the photocurrent density of the CoMoP/BiVO4 composite photoelectrode reached a photocurrent density of 2.8 mA/cm2 at 1.23 V (vs. RHE), which is approximately 3.1 times higher than that of unmodified BiVO4 (0.9 mA/cm2). Under back-side illumination, the composite photoanode generated 3.5 mA/cm2, representing a 2.3-fold improvement over the 1.5 mA/cm2 recorded for bare BiVO4. The bandgap energy of BiVO4 was determined to be approximately 2.44 eV based on UV–vis absorption spectra and the corresponding Tauc plot. Owing to its metallic nature, CoMoP exhibits strong broadband absorption in the visible-light region and does not display an intrinsic semiconductor bandgap behavior. Combined with photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and PEC results, it was demonstrated that the CoMoP loading effectively promoted interfacial charge separation and transport while accelerating water oxidation kinetics. These results demonstrate that the CoMoP/BiVO4 system serves as an advanced semiconductor material with excellent performance for photoelectrocatalytic water splitting.",

    "Abstract": "In this preliminary study, chitosan-based molecularly imprinted polymers crosslinked with glutaraldehyde were synthesized and evaluated for the selective removal of m-cresol, a volatile phenol associated with the sensory defect known as smoke taint in wine. Three formulations of chitosan-based molecularly imprinted polymers (MIP-Gs) were synthesized using glutaraldehyde as a crosslinker and m-cresol as a template. Non-imprinted polymers (NIP-Gs) served as controls. The polymers were characterized by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy, which confirmed successful crosslinking and structural differences between MIPs and NIPs. Adsorption performance was evaluated using solid-phase extraction cartridges packed with the synthesized polymers, employing a Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The MIPs exhibited higher adsorption efficiency and selectivity toward m-cresol compared to NIPs, achieving removal rates of 15% to 40%, depending on polymer formulation and analyte concentration. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to investigate polymer–analyte interactions at the molecular level, providing mechanistic insight into the preferential binding of m-cresol within the imprinted cavities. Physicochemical analyses of red wine showed that m-cresol removal occurred with minimal impact on key phenolic parameters, supporting the functional selectivity of MIPs. These results demonstrate that chitosan-based MIPs constitute a promising class of materials for selective adsorption applications in complex liquid systems.",

    "Abstract": "Simulation-based training systems are increasingly deployed to prepare learners for complex, safety-critical, and dynamic work environments. While advances in computing have enabled immersive and data-rich simulations, many systems remain optimized for procedural accuracy and surface-level task performance rather than the macrocognitive processes that underpin adaptive expertise. Macrocognition encompasses higher-order cognitive processes that are essential for performance transfer beyond controlled training conditions. When these processes are insufficiently supported, training systems risk fostering brittle strategies and negative training effects. This paper introduces a macrocognitive design taxonomy for simulation-based training systems derived from a large-scale meta-analysis examining the transfer of macrocognitive skills from immersive simulations to real-world training environments. Drawing on evidence synthesized from 111 studies spanning healthcare, industrial safety, skilled trades, and defense contexts, the taxonomy links macrocognitive theory to human–computer interaction (HCI) design affordances, computational data traces, and feedback and adaptation mechanisms shown to support transfer. Grounded in joint cognitive systems theory and learning engineering practice, the taxonomy treats macrocognition as a designable and computable system concern informed by empirical transfer effects rather than as an abstract explanatory construct.",

    "Abstract": "Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were carried out on various samples to characterize their thermal expansion over a wide temperature range (93–1373 K). Using an effective interatomic potential model, we present a method to empirically estimate the Grüneisen parameter, as well as cubic and quartic anharmonic contributions to the lattice potential. This method is further tested on materials for which thermal expansion data are readily available. For most of the materials surveyed, the Grüneisen parameter values match those reported in the literature, obtained using traditional techniques. Thus, this work presents a novel and convenient Grüneisen parameter estimation method that uses measurements of only one physical property, thermal expansion.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate temporomandibular joint (TMJ) morphology in individuals with impacted maxillary and mandibular canine teeth using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and to compare the findings with those of a control group without impacted canines. Methods: A total of 80 individuals were included in this retrospective study. Based on CBCT images, participants were divided into three groups: the impacted maxillary canine group (n = 30), impacted mandibular canine group (n = 20), and control group (n = 30). CBCT images were oriented in the 3D Slicer software according to the Frankfurt Horizontal plane and the midsagittal reference line. Condylar width, length, position, angular parameters, joint spaces, and condylar volume were measured. Appropriate parametric and non-parametric statistical tests were used for intergroup comparisons. Results: The control group exhibited significantly higher values of condylar width, coronal condylar position and angle, certain joint spaces, and condylar volume compared with both impacted maxillary and mandibular canine groups (p &lt; 0.05). In particular, significant differences were observed for condylar width (p ≤ 0.002) (Control: 19.76 ± 2.09 mm, Maxillary: 17.92 ± 2.14 mm, Mandibular: 17.76 ± 1.64 mm), coronal condylar position (p &lt; 0.001) (Control: 7.50 ± 1.34 mm, Maxillary: 6.02 ± 0.89 mm, Mandibular: 6.30 ± 0.83 mm), coronal condylar angle (p &lt; 0.001) (Control: 25.09° ± 4.40, Maxillary: 28.80° ± 3.70, Mandibular: 33.37° ± 4.10), and condylar volume (p &lt; 0.001) (Control: 1755.87 ± 357.32 mm3, Maxillary: 1337.18 ± 302.65 mm3, Mandibular: 1252.71 ± 369.24 mm3). No significant differences were found between the impacted maxillary and mandibular canine groups for most parameters (p &gt; 0.05). Right–left side comparisons demonstrated that bilateral symmetry was largely preserved, except for condylar volume (p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions: The presence of impacted canines may influence TMJ morphology, particularly at the level of condylar morphometry and joint spaces. Therefore, considering TMJ morphology in addition to local dental factors when evaluating impacted canines may provide a more comprehensive approach to orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Speech analysis has emerged as a non-invasive tool for automatic PD detection; however, the scarcity and homogeneity of available datasets often limit the generalization capability of machine learning models, motivating the use of data augmentation strategies to improve robustness. Methods: This study presents a data augmentation-based methodology for speech-based classification between PD patients and healthy control subjects. A deep learning model trained from scratch on Mel spectrograms is evaluated using augmentation techniques applied at both the waveform and time–frequency levels. Multiple training and model selection strategies are analyzed and model performance is assessed through internal validation as well as using an independent dataset Results: Experimental results show that carefully selected data augmentation techniques improve classification performance with respect to the non-augmented counterpart, achieving gains of up to 3% in accuracy. However, when evaluated on an independent dataset, these improvements do not consistently translate into better generalization. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that, while data augmentation can effectively enhance model performance within a single dataset, this apparent robustness is not sufficient to guarantee generalization on independent speech corpora for PD detection.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Preterm birth remains a major cause of perinatal morbidity and long-term developmental complications. Existing prediction methods often lack individualized assessment and have limited capability to integrate multi-source maternal–fetal information. This study aims to develop a personalized preterm birth risk prediction model and to construct a visual, interactive digital twin platform that enhances clinical communication and supports early risk identification. Methods: A total of 1157 structured clinical records collected from 2020 to 2024 were preprocessed through automated feature typing, missing-value handling, and normalization. Two complementary machine-learning models—FT-Transformer and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)—were trained and calibrated to produce probabilities. Their outputs were fused using a Stacking Logistic Regression framework to improve prediction stability and calibration. A 3D visualization module was developed using 3ds Max, PyQt6, and PyVista to generate personalized uterine–fetal models based on fetal position, placental location, and Biparietal Diameter (BPD), enabling synchronized display of prediction results. Results: The fused model achieved an AUC of 0.820, PR-AUC of 0.405, a Brier score of 0.040, and an expected calibration error (ECE) of 3.39 × 10−3, demonstrating superior discrimination and probability reliability compared with single models. The interactive platform supports real-time data input, risk prediction, and adaptive 3D rendering, providing clear and intuitive visual feedback for clinical interpretation. Conclusions: The integration of machine learning fusion and digital twin visualization enables individualized assessment of preterm birth risk. The system improves model accuracy, enhances interpretability, and offers a practical tool for clinical follow-up, risk counseling, and maternal health education.",

    "Abstract": "Small-intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is defined by an excessive microbial presence in the small intestine and is associated with a range of gastrointestinal symptoms. Its management remains complex due to diagnostic limitations and high recurrence rates following treatment. A narrative review was conducted using MEDLINE (PubMed) and Cochrane databases to identify relevant studies published between 1984 and 2024. Search terms included small intestinal bacterial overgrowth SIBO, FODMAP, probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics, and low-carbohydrate diets. Reference lists were also screened for additional studies. Antibiotics, particularly rifaximin, are commonly used for SIBO treatment but recurrence is frequent. Dietary strategies, such as low-FODMAP and low-carbohydrate diets, may help reduce symptoms, especially in patients with complications like D-lactic acidosis. Evidence for biotic agents (probiotics, prebiotics, synbiotics) is mixed, with limited high-quality studies and inconsistent outcomes. Some probiotic strains show symptom improvement, but effects on breath-test results are variable. A tailored, multidisciplinary approach combining dietary and medical therapies may offer optimal symptom control in SIBO. However, heterogeneity in study designs and limited evidence highlight the need for further research to inform standardised, evidence-based clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "In today’s information ecosystem, disinformation threatens civic autonomy and the stability of public discourse. Beyond the intentional spread of false information, it often appears as narrative divergence among sources interpreting shared events, generating fragmentation and measurable losses in structural coherence. This study examines disinformation within an entropic structural framework, defining it as narrative disorder and epistemic incoherence in information systems. The approach moves beyond fact-checking by treating narrative structure and informational order as quantifiable attributes of public communication. We present the QVP-RI (Relational Information Valuation) operator, a computational model that quantifies narrative divergence through informational entropy and normalized structural divergence, without issuing truth assessments. Implemented through state-of-the-art NLP pipelines and entropic analysis, the operator maps narrative structure and epistemic order across plural media environments. Unlike accuracy-driven approaches, it evaluates narrative coherence and informational utility (IU) as complementary indicators of epistemic value. Experimental validation with 500 participants confirms the robustness of the structural–entropic model and identifies high divergence regions, revealing communication vulnerabilities and showing how narrative disorder enables disinformation dynamics. The QVP-RI operator thus offers a computationally grounded tool for analyzing disinformation as narrative divergence and for strengthening epistemic order in open information systems.",

    "Abstract": "This paper re-examines the role of trade and FDI inflows in accelerating the process of industrial growth involving countries belonging to the “Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)” region. Trade openness and foreign direct investment (FDI) have improved the growth performance of numerous economies and regions over the years. However, the specific role of both trade openness and FDI inflows in advancing the industrial growth process of economies has yet to be investigated in the case of economies belonging to ASEAN. This study analyzes data from 2000 to 2023 and employs several relevant econometric tools, including the “Pooled Ordinary Least Squares (POLS)”, “Fixed Effects Filter (FEF)”, “Feasible Generalized Least Squares (FGLS)” and “Two Stages Least Squares (TSLS)”, to assess the specific impact of both trade openness and FDI inflows on industrial growth. Our findings show that both trade openness and FDI have advanced the industrial growth of ASEAN member economies. In terms of relative importance, the impact of trade openness is higher as compared to FDI inflows on the industrial sector. Similarly, the results demonstrate that the industrial growth of ASEAN economies could be explained positively by increased domestic investment and government expenditures. Moreover, our results indicate that the inflation rate and the natural resource sector have adversely impacted industrial growth. Finally, the labor force has not had the desirable positive impact on the industrial progress of ASEAN economies. The obtained results are robust across alternative specifications and estimation techniques. Therefore, our results have important policy implications for ASEAN economies.",

    "Abstract": "The Meese–Rogoff puzzle suggests that exchange rate models rarely outperform a random walk in out-of-sample forecasting. This paper re-examines that puzzle in the context of the German hyperinflation, an environment in which monetary forces dominate economic behavior. Using simple bivariate specifications derived from the quantity theory of money, purchasing power parity, and the monetary model of exchange rates, the paper evaluates forecasting performance against a random walk benchmark. The results show that during the most intense phase of hyperinflation, these fundamentals-based models can outperform the random walk in terms of root mean square error. This finding indicates that exchange rate predictability is regime-dependent and that, under extreme monetary instability, basic theoretical relationships can regain forecasting power.",

The proposed model employs separable 1D convolution and global average pooling, and applies aggressive structured pruning to reduce the number of parameters from 3121 to 358, representing an 88.5% reduction, without significant accuracy loss. Using quantization-aware training (QAT), the network is trained and executed in INT8, which reduces weight storage to one-quarter of the 32-bit baseline while maintaining high estimation accuracy with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0172. The hardware adopts a time-multiplexed single MAC architecture with FSM control, occupying 98,410 gates under a 28 nm process. Evaluations on an FPGA testbed with representative drive-cycle inputs show that the proposed INT8 pipeline achieves performance comparable to the floating-point reference with negligible precision drop, demonstrating its suitability for in-vehicle BMS deployment.",

    "Abstract": "Growing global energy demand and the imperative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions have accelerated interest in low-carbon hydrogen production. This review synthesizes advances at the intersection of electrolysis and biomass pyrolysis, with particular emphasis on the emerging role of biochar as a functional and catalytic material that enhances hydrogen generation while supporting sustainable bioenergy value chains. Recent evidence shows that biochar-assisted water electrolysis (BAWE) can lower energy requirements, improve reaction efficiency, and valorize locally available biomass resources. This positions biochar as a promising complement to conventional green hydrogen pathways. The review further assesses South Africa’s evolving policy and regulatory architecture by highlighting the country’s ambition to build a competitive hydrogen economy alongside structural constraints such as limited electrolyzer manufacturing capability, inadequate infrastructure, and insufficiently targeted frameworks for technology scale-up. The review analysis therefore emphasizes that integrating biomass-derived materials into hydrogen production presents an underexplored yet high-potential route for advancing national decarbonization goals. Strengthened research, development, and innovation systems, supported by coherent and technology-specific policy measures, will be essential for South Africa to unlock the full economic, environmental, and industrial benefits of a green hydrogen and biochar-integrated future.",

    "Abstract": "The need to mitigate climate change has increased interest in Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plants, which reduce landfill use while generating power, but remain significant sources of carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) represents a promising pathway to substantially reduce emissions from WtE facilities and, when applied to WtE, it can enable net-zero or carbon-negative systems by capturing both non-biogenic and biogenic CO2. This review systematically analyzes existing Waste-to-Energy plants implementing carbon capture technologies. By collecting and critically assessing the available technical and operational information, this work provides a comprehensive synthesis that is currently lacking in the literature. Based on the reported data, only a limited number of WtE plants with CCUS are operating worldwide. Among these, facilities with the most detailed publicly available information are located in Saga City (Japan), Twence (The Netherlands), Klemetsrud (Norway), Duiven (The Netherlands), and Copenhagen (Denmark). This review highlights the current deployment status of WtE + CCUS systems and identifies key insights to support future research and large-scale implementation.",

    "Abstract": "This paper proposes a novel, dual-output, hybrid-clamped, quasi-five-level inverter (DO-HC-FLI) topology, capable of providing two independent AC voltage outputs with adjustable frequency and amplitude. Derived from a dual-output, active, neutral-point-clamped, three-level inverter, the proposed topology introduces three additional switches per phase to create dynamic switching paths. This expands the available range of DC-side voltage outputs and significantly improves the utilization rate of the DC–link voltage. Additionally, by adopting an asymmetric DC–link voltage configuration, the output line voltage levels of the conventional four-level inverter are increased to a number comparable to that of a five-level inverter. The front-end stage employs a hybrid series-parallel architecture, integrating dual Buck circuits with DC power sources. This configuration supplies the subsequent inverter stage with DC voltage levels at an optimal asymmetric ratio. In conjunction with a dual-output space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) strategy, the proposed system can collaboratively optimize the output voltage level characteristics of the inverter stage. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis and comparison with other multilevel inverters are presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed topology. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed topology and modulation strategy.",

    "Abstract": "Droop control is an effective power regulation method for islanded microgrids to cope with fluctuations in renewable energy and loads. However, its power coordination performance is easily affected by the line impedance. When virtual impedance is introduced to enhance impedance matching, fixed values struggle to adapt flexibly to varying grid conditions. To address this specific limitation, this paper proposes a novel power coordination control strategy based on real-time line impedance identification. The method first analyzes the power distribution principle and equilibrium conditions under droop control. Crucially, it then establishes a dynamic virtual impedance regulation mechanism. By continuously identifying the actual line impedance, the proposed strategy dynamically adjusts the virtual impedance, thereby reshaping the inverter’s output impedance in real-time to match the grid conditions. This approach directly enhances the inverter’s adaptability to impedance variations, which is the core challenge in robust power coordination. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared to methods using fixed virtual impedance, the proposed strategy significantly improves power-sharing accuracy and system robustness under uncertainties such as fluctuating line impedance and load changes.",

    "Abstract": "This paper develops a theoretical model analyzing the optimal timing of switching from fossil-fuel-based energy to cleaner technologies in a stochastic environment. The economy consists of two interacting sectors: a backstop-production sector (e.g., solar panels), which uses both fossil fuels and backstop energy, and a consumption sector that initially relies exclusively on fossil fuels but can adopt a hybrid (cleaner) technology by incurring a fixed, irreversible investment cost. Both pollution accumulation and backstop accumulation are assumed to be stochastic. Our results indicate that the optimal timing for switching is significantly influenced by technological parameters, particularly the dependence on fossil fuels in post-switch production and the extent of technological gains in backstop manufacturing. Specifically, reducing fossil-fuel reliance and improving backstop technology both accelerate the adoption of cleaner technologies. We also find that uncertainty can either accelerate or delay adoption, depending on technological progress and intertemporal substitution preferences. These findings underscore the importance of policies that decrease fossil fuel dependence while fostering innovation in renewable energy technologies.",

    "Abstract": "This study provides a field evaluation of a deep container-based nursery system for tropical dry forest species. Deep containers are expected to improve seedling quality for dryland restoration, but their applicability to tropical dry forest species remains poorly documented. This study examined species-specific responses of five tropical dry forest species to two contrasting nursery systems, including a deep container system, under practical conditions. Five tropical dry forest species in Myanmar were raised in two nursery systems: conventional vinyl pots (18 cm depth) filled with soil-based media amended with manure and deep M-StAR containers (60 cm depth) filled with coconut peat and supplied with chemical fertilizer. Seedling morphology was assessed in the nursery, and survival and growth were monitored after outplanting. Seedlings raised in the deep container system exhibited substantially greater growth in the nursery phase across all species, attaining a several-fold larger size than conventional seedlings, and this size advantage persisted for 16 months after outplanting. However, higher survival was observed only for Tamarindus indica raised in this system (76%) compared with the conventional system (21%), whereas the other four species showed high survival (&gt;80%) regardless of the nursery system. The observed benefits reflect the combined effects of the deep container system, and early post-planting survival may be species-specific and related to drought strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Soil organic matter (SOM) molecular composition governs its stability and ecological functions in forest ecosystems. Nevertheless, how land-use changes (LUCs) regulate the SOM molecular composition remains poorly understood, particularly the underlying mechanisms mediated by soil properties. This study investigated the effects of LUCs on SOM molecular composition in a subtropical coastal region and examined the driving roles of soil nutrient availability and enzyme activities. The research was conducted in Huanghai National Forest Park, Jiangsu Province, China, focusing on four land-use types converted from historical wheat cropland (W, as control): monoculture plantations of Ginkgo biloba (G) and Metasequoia glyptostroboides (M), a ginkgo–metasequoia mixed forest (GM), and a ginkgo–wheat agroforestry system (GW). Soil samples were collected from 0 to 20 cm and 20–40 cm layers and analyzed for SOM molecular compositions using solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Soil chemical properties and enzyme activity activities were also determined, with redundancy analysis (RDA) and correlation analysis applied to identify key influencing factors. Results demonstrated that LUCs significantly altered SOM molecular composition. The GW system exhibited the highest proportion of labile O-alkyl carbon (42.65%), while the M plantation accumulated greatest levels of stable aromatic carbon (up to 49.25%). During the initial decades following afforestation, soil nutrient availability and enzyme activities were confirmed as pivotal drivers of SOM molecular variation. Specifically, available potassium (AK), ammonium nitrogen (AN), and the carbon/phosphorus (C/P) ratio were significantly correlated with specific SOM components (p &lt; 0.05). The elevated O-alkyl carbon proportion in GW was closely associated with its higher invertase activity. Notably, vertical differentiation in SOM stability was observed across land-use types, with the agroforestry system achieving the highest carbon pool management index in surface soil but showing a weakened capacity for subsoil C stabilization. RDA further confirmed that AK and AN were dominant factors shaping SOM molecular composition. In conclusion, LUCs modulate SOM chemical composition and stability primarily through altering soil nutrient availability and associated enzyme activities. Agroforestry system facilitates labile C accumulation in surface soil, whereas monoculture plantations are more conducive to stable C sequestration, especially in subsoil layers. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into SOM dynamics following LUCs and offer a theoretical basis for formulating tailored management strategies to enhance C sequestration efficiency in subtropical coastal ecosystems.",

    "Abstract": "Integrating Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to enhance mobility management in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) comes with an additional critical risk. Because centralized controllers are single points of failure, they create the risk that the network will be subject to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks during handovers. Most Intrusion Detection and Prevention systems (IDPSs) do not adequately address these risks because they are topology-blind and have excessive processing layers. This article presents a novel Location-Aware SDN-IDPS Framework that employs a hierarchical defense approach to protect vehicular networks against volumetric attacks. This two-plane system operates with the first tier, which uses dynamic host-location mappings to drop spoofed traffic at the switch level (data plane). In contrast, the second tier analyzes confirmed traffic through a Suricata-based engine to identify and respond to complex flood attack patterns. The experimental results from the Mininet-WiFi testbed show that the system provides a significant improvement over the unprotected state, with controller CPU utilization reduced by up to 18 times (from 9.0% to below 0.5%). In addition, the system provides a 2.3 s guaranteed recovery time, service continuity, successful microsecond-level mitigation time, and a packet delivery ratio (PDR) of 99.73% for legitimate safety messages. In control-plane stress testing, the proposed location-aware logic improved throughput stability by approximately 76.26% compared to the baseline. These findings confirm that offloading anti-spoofing logic to the network edge significantly enhances resilience without compromising performance in safety-critical vehicular environments.",

    "Abstract": "In a context of increasing wildfire risk and highly fragmented forest ownership, this work investigates two relatively recent monetary policy instruments in Catalonia that require grouped applications: a subsidy for fuel reduction, which prioritises collective applications in wildfire-strategic areas, and a climate credit system that promotes territorially coordinated, multifunctional forest management that, i.a., decreases wildfire risk through fuel management. Through in-depth interviews with beneficiaries and consultations with key informants, we analysed whether these measures have triggered adjacent forest management, and how they have interacted with joint action rules to facilitate concerted interventions. The qualitative content analysis indicates that these measures represent a significant step towards landscape-level management and that pre-existing forest owners’ associations play a crucial role in capturing the available funds. The eligibility of coordination costs is also appreciated for covering the transaction costs of catalysing landowners. Yet, areas with weaker social capital may become disadvantaged if there is no external support for their organisation. These findings contribute to the emerging field of policy tools for effective landscape-level interventions.",

    "Abstract": "Goose yolk, the primary source of nutrients and flavor, is particularly susceptible to quality deterioration during storage, yet its metabolic dynamics remain poorly characterized. To elucidate these changes, we combined physicochemical assays with untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomics to systematically profile the temporal metabolic alterations in goose egg yolks stored at 4 °C for up to 60 days, using day-1 yolks as fresh controls. Our analysis quantified 1005 metabolites and identified a critical metabolic shift occurring after 30 days of storage. Among 21 significantly altered metabolites, the sustained decline of adenosine and 2-aminopurine, alongside the accumulation of 4-hydroxyretinoic acid, strongly correlated with the loss of egg freshness. Interaction network and pathway analyses pinpointed purine metabolism—with adenosine and 2-aminopurine as central nodes—as a core pathway impaired in yolk during storage. Crucially, we identify 2-aminopurine as a novel, storage-sensitive biomarker for goose egg freshness derived from yolk metabolomics, directly linking intracellular metabolic dysregulation to observable quality decline. This study deciphers the metabolic landscape of goose egg yolk aging and provides a targeted, mechanism-based strategy for yolk-centric quality monitoring and preservation, offering new insights for food composition analysis and safety assurance.",

    "Abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), a potent carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, is a critical food contaminant originating from environmental deposition and thermal processing, posing a significant threat to public health and driving stringent global regulations. This review critically examines recent advancements in analytical methodologies for BaP determination, giving particular emphasis to sample preparation and detection techniques. The discussion covers the evolution from conventional methods, such as solid-phase extraction, towards more efficient and sustainable approaches, including magnetic, dispersive, and molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction, as well as microextraction techniques and gel permeation chromatography. For detection, the performance of established chromatographic methods, such as gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD), is evaluated against emerging rapid techniques such as sensors, immunoassays, and spectroscopic methods. The analysis reveals that while significant progress has been made in improving sensitivity, selectivity, and throughput, challenges remain in balancing speed with accuracy, managing matrix effects, and translating novel materials from research to routine application. The review concludes by underscoring the necessity for future development to focus on the integration of smart materials, automation, and advanced data science to achieve robust, on-site, and holistic monitoring solutions for ensuring food safety against BaP contamination.",

    "Abstract": "Fructooligosaccharides (FOS), an important prebiotic, are widely used in the food industry. β-Fructofuranosidases are commonly used for FOS production with yield of 55~60% (crude FOS syrup). The by-products glucose and fructose are produced during enzymatic conversion of FOS. Thus, the strategy for FOS production with high content (higher than 95%) has long been a topic of concern. In this study, a novel yeast Wickerhamomyces anomalus CAU331 was isolated from Daqu and applied for fermentation of crude FOS syrup. Impurities of glucose and fructose in the syrup were metabolized, which yielded a FOS content of 87.6%. Subsequently, the β-fructofuranosidase (AnFTase70) was added and synergistically worked with W. anomalus CAU331. A maximum FOS content of 95.1% with a concentration of 288.1 g/L and productivity of 6.26 g/L/h was obtained through the sequential action of β-fructofuranosidase and W. anomalus CAU331 in a 200 L fermenter. Moreover, the FOS components were composed of 19.2 g/L 1-kestose (GF2), 127.8 g/L nystose (GF3), 115.8 g/L 1F-fructofuranosylnystose (GF4), and 25.5 g/L kestohexaose (GF5). The findings gained in this study might provide a cost-effective approach for the production of FOS with high purity and expand their applications as functional food materials.",

Although numerous studies have detailed effective methodologies for delivering literacy or nutrition education in silos, there is no protocol for developing, implementing, and evaluating a brief, interdisciplinary literacy and nutrition education program for parent–child dyads. Books &amp; Cooks, a seven-week literacy and nutrition education program aimed at improving families’ literacy and nutrition capacities by providing parents with strategies to assist their child, facilitating interactive education lessons, and providing take-home reflection activities, was piloted during the 2023–2024 school year. Results informed the protocol for current and future cohorts in efforts to further enhance outcomes. Family literacy capacity is addressed using evidence-based, grade-appropriate literacy techniques and evaluated using validated and internally developed instruments. Family nutrition capacity is addressed through education and cooking lessons based on the 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines and MyPlate and evaluated using validated instruments. Results will be analyzed by assessing change from baseline to post-program completion, addressing potential confounding factors, and utilizing randomization. By detailing the development, implementation, and evaluation of this study, we anticipate that this protocol will provide guidance for cross-functional collaborators who seek to address various public health concerns in at-risk populations.",

Cirrhosis of the liver is the most advanced form of chronic liver disease and the 12th leading cause of death worldwide. The incidence of liver cirrhosis is increasing significantly each year due to the increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome associated with fatty liver disease. Liver biopsy has been traditionally considered the “gold standard” method for the evaluation of tissue lesions (e.g., liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease), and it is still accepted as such. However, it is an invasive and costly method with potential risks for patients. Thus, we decided to evaluate the importance of non-invasive tests (NIT) and the combinations of NIT used for the diagnosis and staging of liver fibrosis in metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease—MASLD—and how the primary care physician is involved in these stages. In this context, primary care physicians will be the first in contact with these patients, who could initiate early, well-targeted treatment to prevent disease progression and complications, which could reduce the number of costly consultations and specialist investigations.",

    "Abstract": "High-resolution biofabrication requires precise microscale deposition, yet drop-on-demand (DOD) inkjet bioprinting is constrained by a narrow printable viscosity window. Many biocompatible hydrogel precursors display high zero-shear viscosity and strong shear-thinning, so stable droplet ejection typically requires dilution or reformulation that can compromise the biochemical microenvironment. We present a transient shear-enabled jetting method that exploits intrinsic shear-thinning by using a high-frequency electromagnetic microvalve to deliver short, high-pressure pulses. The resulting localized shear dynamically lowers apparent viscosity in the nozzle region and promotes controlled nucleation, ligament formation, necking, and pinch-off. A coupled, rheology-informed modeling framework (axisymmetric transient CFD, valve dynamics, and electromagnetic FEM) links actuation parameters to droplet volume and stability and guides hardware optimization. Experiments with 2.5% (w/v) sodium alginate validate stable droplet generation and tunable droplet size via stroke length and driving conditions. These results define a practical process window for high-resolution droplet printing of high-viscosity shear-thinning hydrogel inks.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Global longitudinal strain (GLS), derived from long-axis cine images (LAX), is a sensitive marker for myocardial dysfunction and a strong predictor for clinical events and future ventricular deterioration. In patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD) transverse-oriented cine imaging is part of the standard cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) protocol. We aimed to study the feasibility and reproducibility of strain measurements derived from transverse-oriented cine images (Transverse Strain (TrS)) and compare them with standard GLS. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed CMR cine images from 40 patients (n = 20 Fontan, n = 20 Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF)) and 10 healthy controls. Strain analysis was performed in every subject using both the conventional GLS and the TrS approach. Results: TrS showed high intra- and interobserver reproducibility in patients with CHD (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) &gt; 0.75, p &lt; 0.05). Intermethod agreement between TrS and GLS was strong in Fontan patients and in the right ventricle (RV) of ToF patients (ICC &gt; 0.75) but showed a positive bias for TrS in the left ventricle (LV) of ToF patients (mean difference = 5.03) and in both ventricles of healthy controls (mean difference LV = 5.36, RV = 4.01). Conclusions: TrS is feasible and reproducible and may offer a new methodological approach for strain assessment, especially in CHD patients with univentricular physiology and ToF patients. Further studies are needed to validate this new approach and perform correlations to clinical outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: This review specifically focuses on interventional clinical trials in leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), summarizing how patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have been implemented to evaluate treatment effects rather than to directly influence clinical outcomes. Objective: Clinical outcomes of interest typically include response rates, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are standardized questionnaires that collect information regarding health outcomes directly from the patient and are used to evaluate new treatments and healthcare quality. In addition, the use of PROMs in cancer care has been shown to improve patient-provider communication and patient satisfaction. Material and Methods: This is a qualitative, narrative synthesis and review structured around PROMs focused on six critical themes: symptoms/symptom burden, physical, emotional, social/role, and functional status, and global health status measurement. Results: PROMs that are assessed in oncologic research include the EORTC QLQ-C30, FACT-Leu, QLQ-CLL16, and EQ-5D. PROs are associated with clinical outcomes such as DFS and OS, and the FACT-Leu scales, HRQOL and physical functioning scores were independent prognosticators of OS in patients with AML. Conclusions: Through our review, notable trends were identified that further highlight the importance of greater incorporation of PRO measures in future clinical trials, particularly in the understudied realm of hematologic malignancies, in order to better delineate the link between survival and HRQOL.",

    "Abstract": "Climate change can alter both the amount and timing of inflows to water supply reservoirs while also increasing heat-driven demand and the likelihood of stressful warm-season conditions. Climate-driven changes in inflow to Eagle Mountain Lake Reservoir (Texas, USA) were quantified by integrating (i) a calibrated SWAT model evaluated at four USGS stream gauges, (ii) statistically downscaled CMIP6 daily precipitation and minimum/maximum temperature at seven stations/grid points for a historical baseline (2003–2022) and two future windows (2031–2050 and 2081–2100) under SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5, and (iii) observed reservoir operations (lake level, water supply releases, and flood discharge; 1990–2022). A standard watershed climate workflow is reframed through an operations-focused lens, wherein projected inflow changes are translated into decision-relevant indicators via the utilization of observed thresholds and operating mode signals. Included within this framework are spring refill-season inflow shifts, a hot–dry month metric, and storage threshold performance measures, which are coupled with screening-level probabilities linked to multi-year inflow deficits. Across models and stations, mean annual temperature increases by 0.7–1.9 °C in the 2030s and by 0.7–6.1 °C in the 2080s, while annual precipitation changes remain uncertain (−24% to +55%). Daily projections show a strong increase in extreme heat days (daily Tmax above the historical 95th percentile), from about 18 days yr−1 historically to about 30–33 days yr−1 in the 2030s and about 34–82 days yr−1 by the 2080s. Hot–dry months (monthly mean Tmax above the historical 90th percentile and monthly precipitation below the historical median) increase modestly by mid-century and rise to about 1.5 months yr−1 on average by the 2080s under SSP5-8.5. SWAT simulations indicate that the mean annual inflow declines by 17–20% across scenarios, with the largest reductions during the spring refill period (March–June). Historical operations show that hot–dry months are associated with approximately double the mean water supply release (7.2 vs. 3.5 m3/s) and a lower monthly minimum lake level (about 0.30 m; about 1.0 ft lower on average). Flood discharges occur almost exclusively when lake elevation is at or above about 197.8 m and follow multi-day rainfall clusters (cross-validated AUC = 0.99). Together, these results indicate that earlier-season inflow reductions and more frequent hot–dry stress will tighten the operational margin between refill, summer demand, and flood management, underscoring the need for adaptive drought response triggers and integrated drought–flood planning for the Dallas–Fort Worth region.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Growing antibiotic resistance and the limited availability of key components in standard Helicobacter pylori treatments have driven the search for effective alternatives. Minocycline, with its broad-spectrum activity and favorable pharmacokinetics, has emerged as a promising substitute. This meta-analysis compares the safety and efficacy of minocycline-containing bismuth quadruple therapy (MBQT) to conventional first-line BQT regimens, incorporating data from the recent study by Lin et al. Methods: The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a target population of both treatment-naïve and previously treated patients diagnosed with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. The intervention received by eligible patients was a minocycline–bismuth quadruple therapy (MBQT) regimen containing bismuth, minocycline, proton pump inhibitors (PPI), and any additional antibiotic with a minimum period of 2 weeks of administration. We excluded study designs other than RCT and clinical trials that include patients without confirmed H. pylori infection, animal populations, in vitro experiments, and reports of other outcomes that did not include a minimum intervention duration of 2 weeks. A comprehensive literature search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and ScienceDirect from inception to 20 May 2025. After screening via Rayyan, data were extracted on an Excel spreadsheet. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included and analyzed using RevMan 5.4. Outcomes assessed were intention-to-treat and per-protocol eradication rates. Adverse effects were compared among therapies. A random-effects model was used; an I2 &lt; 50% and p-value &lt; 0.05 indicated homogeneity and significant results respectively. Results: Five RCTs with 7 interventions involving 2812 patients were included. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for MBQT in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis was 1.25 (95% CI: 0.96–1.61), showing a non-significant trend. No heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 0.0%). In the modified ITT (mITT) analysis (2 studies), MBQT showed higher eradication (OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 0.00–1042.90), but wide CI and high heterogeneity (I2 = 70.7%) limited interpretation. All studies were included in the per-protocol (PP) analysis, which showed a statistically significant improvement with MBQT (OR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.14–2.45) and low heterogeneity (I2 = 5.2%), suggesting consistent results. Although not statistically significant, MBQT was associated with a slightly lower rate of adverse events compared to standard therapy (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.59–1.12). I2 = 50.6% showed moderate heterogeneity in safety outcomes. Discussion: the number of included RCTs was modest, with only five studies meeting eligibility criteria, and only two contributing to the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The risk-of-bias assessment showed variation in methodological quality across the included studies. Several studies exhibited high risk judgments in critical domains. particularly randomization, deviations from intervention, and selective reporting. Patients who completed the treatment benefited more from MBQT, which also had a comparable safety profile to conventional BQT regimens. In the treatment of H. pylori infection, MBQT may be considered a safe alternative for first-line treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Risk management has become increasingly important in the financial world. Considering its importance, it is necessary to measure these risks. The financial market uses two risk measures: Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES). After the subprime crisis, the market began to emphasize ES instead of VaR. The hypothesis of this paper to be tested is that longer periods provide better information than shorter, more recent periods for measuring ES volatility to hedge trades. The ES can be adopted using parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric methods, and the analyses of the log return indicators started on 3 January 2000 and ended on 5 May 2023. The analyses carried out to evaluate these log return indicators covered the period from 6 May 2023 to 1 August 2025, where it was found that the exchange rate volatility of the Brazilian Real exceeded the VaR limits and even reached the Expected Shortfall risk zone. Then, a different analysis was performed, starting on 11 March 2020 and ending on 5 May 2023. This second analysis, as the first analysis, was carried out to evaluate these log return indicators that covered the period from 6 May 2023 to 1 August 2025. In this latest period analysis, the exchange rate volatility of the Brazilian Real reached the Exchange Shortfall risk zone in a different way compared to the first way. All three types of methods—parametric, non-parametric, and semi-parametric—show distinct behaviors depending on the period evaluated. The hypothesis was rejected, but the hedging strategies should account for asset volatility. The software used to calculate the estimators was Microsoft Excel 365 and Stata 14.2.",

    "Abstract": "Physiological hypoxia is a defining feature of early pregnancy, coordinating menstrual repair, implantation, decidualization, placental development, and fetoplacental adaptation. Hypoxia-inducible factors, HIF-1α and HIF-2α, act as master regulators of these processes by sensing oxygen tension and orchestrating cellular responses in metabolism, angiogenesis, immune regulation, and tissue remodeling. Although structurally related, HIF-1α and HIF-2α exhibit distinct spatial and temporal functions across reproductive stages. Embryonic HIF-1α is primarily involved in early embryonic development, whereas embryonic HIF-2α is required for later developmental stages. Furthermore, maternal HIF-1α acts early in pregnancy, coordinating metabolic adaptation, endometrial regeneration, decidualization, angiogenic expansion, placental organization, and maternal immune tolerance. In contrast, maternal HIF-2α regulates epithelial breakdown, trophoblast invasion, implantation mechanics, and vesicle-mediated trafficking. Mouse genetics demonstrate that disruption of either isoform leads to non-redundant defects in reproductive success, from failed implantation to placental insufficiency and fetal lethality. Pathological hypoxia or aberrant HIF signaling drives pregnancy disorders including preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, recurrent pregnancy loss, and heavy menstrual bleeding. Defining the distinct roles of HIF-1α and HIF-2α supports the development of therapies targeting hypoxia-responsive pathways in infertility and obstetric disease.",

    "Abstract": "Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB) was used to produce biocompatible composites with hypromellose as an additive. The study aimed to assess their biological and mechanical properties, as well as specific thermal parameters and phase content. Differential scanning calorimetry was applied to analyze the phase transitions of both biocomposites and the polymer matrix. Furthermore, the thermal parameters—encompassing both non-equilibrium and equilibrium states—of the biocomposites and unfilled P3HB were evaluated according to their thermal history. Using equilibrium parameters such as the heat of fusion for fully crystalline materials and the heat capacity change at the glass transition for fully amorphous composites, we estimated the degrees of crystallinity as well as the mobile and rigid amorphous fractions. Adding hypromellose to the P3HB matrix reduced crystallinity compared to the unfilled material. At the same time, an increase in the amorphous phase was observed. It was also discovered that the rigid amorphous fraction exists solely in biocomposites containing 2% by mass of filler. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the thermal stability of all biocomposites surpasses that of unfilled P3HB. Adding an extra 1% filler by mass raises the degradation temperature by about 37 °C compared to unfilled P3HB. The immunosafety of the tested biocomposites, with very low or no endotoxin contamination, was confirmed in accordance with Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency guidelines. The study clearly demonstrates the influence of the filler in the P3HB matrix on various structural, thermal, mechanical, and biological properties of the prepared biocomposites.",

    "Abstract": "Ampullary carcinoma (AC) is a rare gastrointestinal malignancy with dual intestinal and pancreatobiliary differentiation, complicating diagnosis, staging, and treatment. This review synthesizes current epidemiology, pathology, and multi-omic data to outline a pragmatic care pathway: lineage-first at presentation, mutation-fast at progression. Histology remains the primary classifier: the intestinal subtype generally aligns with colorectal regimens, whereas pancreatobiliary and mixed subtypes favor pancreaticobiliary therapy. In selected fit patients, modified FOLFIRINOX may address mixed phenotypes. Next-generation sequencing adds precision by identifying therapeutically relevant alterations, including ERBB2/HER2 amplifications, MSI-high/dMMR, BRAF V600E, and rare NTRK or RET fusions, while KRAS mutations are enriched in pancreatobiliary tumors. We recommend early application of a rapid-core panel (KRAS/BRAF, MSI/dMMR, ERBB2/HER2, RNA-based fusions) to capture high-impact targets, followed by comprehensive profiling at first progression. Liquid biopsy, plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), or bile-derived DNA may complement tissue and help identify the dominant lineage. Research priorities include ampulla-enriched umbrella trials, explicit AC subcohorts in tissue-agnostic studies, and ctDNA-informed endpoints. This lineage-first, mutation-fast paradigm supports precision care and evidence generation in AC.",

    "Abstract": "Drought stress induces pronounced metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming of glucosinolate (GLS) biosynthesis in Brassica oleracea. An integrative approach combining HPLC-based quantification of individual GLSs, quantitative real-time PCR of core biosynthetic and regulatory genes, correlation-based network analysis, and in silico promoter characterization was applied to evaluate drought responses across genetically diverse accessions. Drought triggered strong, accession-specific shifts in GLS composition, with sinigrin content increasing from 35.9% to 55.1% in BR1 and glucoerucin reaching up to 80.2% in CCP1, while indolic GLSs such as glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin accounted for &gt;75% of total GLSs in CV2 and CCP3. Hierarchical clustering separated accessions into four distinct drought response clusters independent of morphotype. Correlation analysis revealed drought-induced rewiring of GLS interdependencies, characterized by strengthened positive associations among aliphatic GLSs (r &gt; 0.75). Gene expression profiling identified conserved MYB-centered regulatory modules (MYB28, MYB29, MYB34, MYB122) alongside strong accession-specific induction of CYP79F1 (up to 6.3-fold), FMOGS-OX5 (up to 4.8-fold), and ST5a (up to 5.1-fold). Promoter analysis revealed enrichment of ABA- and stress-responsive cis-regulatory elements. These findings delineate a genotype-dependent regulatory framework underlying GLS plasticity and identify quantitative metabolic and transcriptional markers relevant for breeding drought-resilient Brassica cultivars.",

    "Abstract": "Reliable and disease-specific blood biomarkers are critically needed for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), particularly in early stages when interventions are most effective. Although phosphorylated tau and neurofilament light chain (NfL) are widely used, their diagnostic specificity has been reported to decrease in elderly populations with multimorbidities. Syndecan-3 (SDC3), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan implicated in amyloid and tau aggregation, has recently emerged as a mechanistically relevant biomarker candidate. In this clinically realistic cohort study, we examined 46 participants, including 23 clinically diagnosed AD patients and 23 age-matched non-AD individuals with psychiatric and/or metabolic comorbidities. SDC3 expression was quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), while soluble SDC3 and NfL were measured in plasma. Both PBMC-expressed and plasma SDC3 levels were elevated in AD compared with non-AD participants and showed a strong intercorrelation, whereas plasma NfL was likewise increased in AD. Individually, PBMC-SDC3, plasma SDC3, and NfL demonstrated moderate discriminatory performance. However, multivariable models integrating SDC3 (PBMC or plasma), NfL, and age achieved substantially improved discrimination (AUC &gt; 0.8). SDC3 did not correlate with NfL, consistent with a biological signal distinct from neuroaxonal injury and reflective of peripheral immune–metabolic remodeling. Together, these findings identify SDC3 as a blood-based biomarker associated with systemic immune remodeling that complements established neuronal markers in a clinically realistic AD versus non-AD comparison. While exploratory, this study supports further investigation of SDC3 within integrated, multi-domain biomarker strategies in larger and independent cohorts.",

    "Abstract": "Regucalcin (RGN) is a multifunctional regulator of intracellular calcium signaling, implicated in cellular homeostasis and stress responses. While aberrant RGN activity has been associated with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), existing studies have primarily focused on its role in proximal tubular cells. Whether RGN is expressed in podocytes and how its expression responds to diabetic-like stimuli remain largely unexplored. Podocyte injury under diabetic conditions is a critical event in DKD pathogenesis. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate whether podocytes express RGN and how its expression is affected under high-glucose (HG) conditions. To address these questions, we employed quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting, fluorescence-based protein staining, and immunohistochemical analysis of renal sections. Our results confirmed RGN expression in podocytes and revealed its dysregulation at both the mRNA and protein levels under HG conditions. Additionally, we identified the subcellular localization of RGN and a significant association with sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), a key enzyme regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium storage and the ER stress response. Altered RGN expression in podocytes exposed to HG concentrations may contribute to the progression of DKD, possibly through the disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis.",

    "Abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on deep learning have shown significant potential for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) stage classification from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Nevertheless, challenges such as class imbalance, small sample sizes, and the presence of multiple slices per subject may lead to biased evaluation and statistically unreliable performance, particularly for minority classes. In this study, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework is proposed for multi-class AD classification using a Kaggle dataset containing 6400 MRI slices across four cognitive stages. A subject-wise data-splitting strategy is employed to prevent information leakage between the training and testing sets, and the statistical unreliability of near-perfect scores in underrepresented classes is critically examined. An ablation study is conducted to assess the contribution of key architectural components, demonstrating the effectiveness of self-attention and patch embedding in capturing discriminative features. Furthermore, attention-based visualization maps are incorporated to highlight brain regions influencing the model’s decisions and to illustrate subtle anatomical differences between MildDemented and VeryMildDemented cases. The proposed approach achieves a test accuracy of 97.98%, outperforming existing methods on the same dataset while providing improved interpretability. It supports early and accurate AD stage identification.",

    "Abstract": "The Moroccan locust Dociostaurus maroccanus (Thunberg, 1815) (Orthoptera: Acrididae) is recognized as a serious pest of pastures and crops in many Mediterranean countries. So far, the identification of chemical compounds involved in intraspecific communication has been elusive, with only one male-specific compound, namely (2E,7R,11R)-3,7,11,15-tetramethylhexadec-2-enal (2E,7R,11R-phytal), proposed as candidate sex pheromone component. Previous works reported that males also release the sex-specific long-chain aldehydes tetradecanal and hexadecanal, although no evidence of their role in chemical signaling has been presented so far. Here we additionally report another male-specific compound, viz. pentadecanal, and also report the electroantennographic and behavioral responses of virgin and mated females to these three aldehydes. We first demonstrated that their release is age-dependent, with emission overall peaking at 1–2 weeks after fledging. Solid-phase microextraction analyses from male hind legs suggest that these aldehydes are released from this body part. Overall, the antennae of virgin and mated females exhibited a dose-dependent response to increasing concentrations of each aldehyde, except for the response of virgin females to hexadecanal. Significant differences were observed between virgin and mated females at all doses of hexadecanal, while the mating status did not influence the response to tetradecanal and pentadecanal. Furthermore, the behavioral response of females varied according to their mating status. Specifically, mated females showed a significant preference for tetradecanal and pentadecanal, whereas a slight but non-significant attraction to hexadecanal was observed on virgin females. These findings provide new insights into the sexual communication of the species, although further research is needed to decipher their ecological function, especially on mated females.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Progress in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies has resulted in an increasing prevalence of adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD), including those involving genetically determined syndromes. This study aimed to characterize prevalence, congenital phenotypes, heart failure (HF) stages, comorbidity burden, and current medical management of ACHD and concomitant genetically determined syndromes enrolled in a prospective HF-focused registry. Methods: The PATHFINDER-CHD Registry is a German-based (est. 2022) multicenter observational registry. This web-based platform consecutively tracks ACHD patients across the heart failure spectrum, including those with current or prior HF, as well as those at high structural or functional risk. HF stage was classified using a modified ACC/AHA scheme adapted for CHD; functional capacity was graded according to the Perloff classification. Baseline demographics, CHD anatomy, prior surgical/interventional treatment, cardiac and extracardiac comorbidities, and medication were collected from medical records. Results: Among 1987 enrolled ACHD, 107 (5.4%) had a genetic syndrome (n = 65, 60.7% women; mean age 33.5 ± 9.4 years; range 18–68). Most common syndromes were trisomy 21 (n = 49; 45.8%) and 22q11.2 deletion (n = 27; 25.2%); 31 patients (30.0) had rarer syndromes. Predominant CHD diagnoses were atrioventricular septal defect (n = 42, 39.3%), tetralogy of Fallot (n = 19, 17.8%), and pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (n = 7, 6.5%). A systemic left ventricle was present in 102 (95.3%); 40 (37.4%) had primarily cyanotic CHD, and 7 (6.5%) an Eisenmenger physiology. Most patients (n = 71; 66.4%) had undergone definite surgical repair; 25 patients (23.3%) had at least one catheter intervention, including transcatheter valve implantation in 17 cases (15.9%). HF stage was mainly B (n = 30, 28.0%) or C (n = 75, 70.1%). Perloff functional class I/II was present in 97 (90.7%). Leading cardiac comorbidities included intrinsic aortopathy (n = 49, 45.8%), pulmonary arterial hypertension (n = 12, 11.2%), and arrhythmias (n = 10, 9.3%). Frequent extracardiac comorbidities were thyroid dysfunction (n = 34, 31.8%), kidney disease (n = 16, 15.0%), hyperuricemia (n = 13, 12.1%), and depression (n = 15, 14.0%). Pharmacotherapy was used in 66 patients (61.7%). Beta-blockers (n = 25, 23.4%) were common, while ACEi/ARB (n = 9, 8.4%), diuretics (n = 10, 9.3%), MRAs (n = 8, 7.5%), and SGLT2 inhibitors (n = 3; 2.8%) were infrequently prescribed; no patient received ARNI or digitalis. For targeted treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (n = 7, 6.5%), endothelin receptor antagonists (n = 6, 5.6%), or prostacyclin analogues (n = 1, 0.9%) were used. As oral anticoagulants, vitamin K antagonists or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were prescribed in 17 cases (15.9%). Forty-one patients (38.3%) received thyroid hormone replacement. Conclusions: Syndromic ACHD constitute a small but clinically high-risk subgroup within an HF-oriented registry, marked by complex CHD, substantial cardio–extracardiac multimorbidity (notably aortopathy, PAH, thyroid disease, renal dysfunction, depression), and low utilization of contemporary HF therapies. These data support specialized, interdisciplinary, longitudinal care pathways and prospective studies addressing outcomes and evidence-based HF management in syndromic ACHD.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Lower limb amputation affects physical function, mental health, and body image. Rehabilitation outcomes depend on both psychological adjustment and functional performance, including mobility and prosthesis satisfaction. This study aimed to evaluate psychological adjustment, activity restriction, and prosthesis satisfaction among lower-limb prosthetic users in Jordan using the Arabic TAPES-R. Objective: To assess, using a validated tool, the psychological adjustment, activity restriction, and prosthesis satisfaction of lower-limb prosthetic users in Jordan, aligning with the study title and cross-sectional design. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 74 unilateral lower-limb prosthetic users (66.2% male, mean age 42.4 ± 13.1 years). Sociodemographic and body composition characteristics were recorded. Participants completed the Arabic TAPES-R between September 2024 and April 2025. The TAPES-R measured psychosocial adjustment, activity restriction, and prosthesis satisfaction. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Cronbach’s alpha for internal consistency, independent-samples t-tests, and Pearson correlations (p &lt; 0.05). Results: Participants demonstrated generally positive psychosocial adjustment (Psychosocial Total = 3.08 ± 0.52) and moderate prosthesis satisfaction (Total Satisfaction = 2.23 ± 0.47), with variable activity restriction (8.76 ± 5.61). Internal consistency was strong across TAPES-R subscales (α = 0.816–0.955). Functional Satisfaction was higher in those with transfemoral than transtibial amputation (p = 0.041). Psychosocial adjustment correlated positively with prosthesis satisfaction (r = 0.48, p &lt; 0.001) and negatively with activity restriction (r = −0.52, p &lt; 0.001). Residual limb pain (45.9%) was associated with higher activity restriction (p = 0.022), and phantom limb pain (55.4%) with lower prosthetic satisfaction (p = 0.031). Conclusions: The Arabic TAPES-R effectively identifies psychological adjustment, activity restriction, and prosthesis satisfaction in lower-limb prosthetic users in Jordan. Participants generally reported positive psychosocial adjustment and moderate prosthesis satisfaction, but functional limitations remain, particularly in those with residual or phantom limb pain. These findings support the use of the TAPES-R as a clinical and research screening tool and provide guidance for targeted rehabilitation interventions.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with an increased risk of fragility fractures that cannot be fully explained by reduced bone mineral density (BMD), highlighting a potential role for bone quality impairment. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of altered bone density and microarchitecture and to identify their main clinical correlates in adults with T1DM and seemingly adequate glycemic control at the time of assessment. Methods: Sixty-eight adults aged 18–69 years with T1DM attending a diabetes technology outpatient clinic were enrolled in this single-center, cross-sectional study. BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and classified as reduced based on age and sex: Z-score &lt; −2.0 SD for premenopausal women and men &lt; 50 years, and T-score ≤ −2.5 SD for postmenopausal women and men ≥ 50 years. Bone microarchitecture was evaluated using trabecular bone score (TBS). Clinical, metabolic, and lifestyle variables were collected, including glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; good control ≈ 7.0%/53 mmol/mol), diabetes duration, microvascular complications, and physical activity (PA) assessed by the International PA Questionnaire (IPAQ; moderate–high PA defined according to combined high and moderate IPAQ categories). Results: Reduced BMD was observed in 35.3% of patients and was associated with older age (p &lt; 0.001), longer disease duration (p = 0.044), lower body mass index (p = 0.031), poorer glycemic control (p = 0.03), microvascular complications such as diabetic peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.028) and retinopathy (p = 0.045), and low PA (p = 0.012). Altered TBS was present in 45.6% of patients and was associated with older age (p &lt; 0.001), longer diabetes duration (p = 0.011), higher HbA1c levels (p &lt; 0.001), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (p = 0.002), retinopathy (p = 0.007), cardiovascular risk factors (dyslipidemia p = 0.002, hypertension p = 0.002), and low PA (p &lt; 0.001). In multivariable analyses, older age and higher HbA1c were independently associated with reduced TBS, whereas moderate–high PA was associated with a lower likelihood of impaired bone microarchitecture. Conclusions: Impaired bone density and bone quality are highly prevalent in adults with T1DM and are frequently associated with longer disease duration, poorer metabolic control, and chronic complications. Our findings support the potential value of a combined assessment of BMD and TBS in fracture risk evaluation, together with strategies aimed at preventing diabetes-related complications and promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Despite advancements in limb-sparing surgery (LSS), adjuvant therapies, and imaging techniques, amputations remain necessary in certain cases, including locally advanced tumors, inadequate resections, or palliative scenarios. This study aims to provide an overview of tumor-related amputations, comparing primary and secondary amputations in terms of survival, recurrence, and surgical outcomes. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 132 patients undergoing tumor-related amputations between 2004 and 2023 at a tertiary care center was conducted. Patients were stratified by amputation level (major vs. hand/foot) and timing (primary vs. secondary). Kaplan–Meier survival and multivariate regression analysis identified prognostic factors. Results: Major amputations accounted for 77% of cases, while 23% involved the hands or feet. Primary amputations constituted 55% of procedures, and 45% were secondary interventions. Overall survival was 123 months (95% CI, 105–142), with a 5-year survival rate of 66% and a 10-year survival rate of 53%, respectively. Hand/foot amputations showed superior survival compared to major amputations (p = 0.032). Local recurrence emerged as the only significant predictor of overall survival (p = 0.033). Conclusions: Tumor-related amputations remain crucial in musculoskeletal oncology. Survival outcomes are comparable between primary and secondary amputations, but hand/foot amputations are associated with improved survival. Achieving local control is critical, underscoring the need for precise surgical planning.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Postoperative sensory loss is a frequent morbidity following parotidectomy, yet the necessity of preserving the greater auricular nerve (GAN) during parotidectomy remains debated. While some surgeons prioritize nerve sacrifice for better oncological exposure, others advocate for preservation to maintain quality of life (QoL). This narrative review provides a comprehensive synthesis of current evidence regarding the impact of GAN sacrifice on objective sensory modalities, subjective disturbances, and long-term QoL. Methods: A literature search was performed (January 2000–August 2025). Twenty studies, including RCTs and cohorts, were reviewed to synthesize evidence on objective sensory modalities and patient-reported outcomes. Sensory assessments (Semmes–Weinstein monofilaments, VAS, and two-point discrimination) and the POI-8 QoL questionnaire were analyzed. Results: GAN preservation, particularly of the lobular branch, is associated with better early sensory recovery (1–6 months). In the long term (&gt;12 months), although the sensory gap narrows between groups, the sacrifice group exhibits significantly higher rates of persistent anesthesia in localized regions, notably the earlobe. Regarding QoL, while global scores often show no significant long-term differences, 35% of patients with GAN sacrifice continue to experience functional limitations in specific activities, such as telephone use or wearing earrings. Conclusions: Although patients demonstrate adaptation to sensory loss, GAN preservation offers potential benefits in daily function and comfort; thus, it is advised when oncologically feasible. To overcome the high heterogeneity in current evidence, future multicenter trials utilizing unified objective measurements on predefined regions of interest are necessary to further clarify the functional benefits of nerve preservation and establish definitive surgical guidelines.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic pulmonary regurgitation (PR) after the repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) and other right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) interventions leads to progressive right ventricular (RV) dilatation, altered ventricular–ventricular interaction, and an increased risk of arrhythmia and heart failure. Pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), whether surgical or transcatheter, effectively eliminates or reduces PR and is associated with short- and mid-term improvement in RV size, symptoms, and electrocardiographic markers. However, the optimal timing of intervention remains unresolved: operating late can result in irreversible myocardial damage and arrhythmogenic substrates, whereas operating early can lead to repeated reinterventions, the impact of which on hard outcomes is uncertain. This review summarizes contemporary evidence on ventricular remodelling after PVR, focusing on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and echocardiographic markers, and critically appraises proposed criteria for timing PVR. Classic CMR-derived thresholds (RV end-diastolic volume index [RVEDVi] 150–170 mL/m2, RV end-systolic volume index [RVESVi] 80–90 mL/m2) and QRS duration cut-offs are discussed alongside emerging markers of risk, including the RV mass-to-volume ratio, diffuse myocardial fibrosis (extracellular volume fraction), strain imaging, and diastolic dysfunction. Meta-analyses show consistent reverse remodelling and symptomatic benefit after PVR, but no conclusive survival benefit has been demonstrated, and data on arrhythmic outcomes remain conflicting. Key gaps include (i) the lack of prospective randomized or carefully matched comparative studies of “early” versus “deferred” PVR; (ii) limited understanding of how myocardial fibrosis, RV hypertrophy, and diastolic dysfunction interact with volume load and timing to influence long-term outcomes; (iii) under-representation of adult and older adult TOF cohorts; and (iv) insufficient integration of multiparametric risk scores and machine-learning approaches into clinical decision-making. Future research should prioritize multicentre longitudinal cohorts with standardized imaging, electrophysiological and clinical endpoints, incorporate advanced imaging techniques (e.g., strain, 3D late gadolinium enhancement, and T1 mapping), and explore precision-medicine strategies to individualize PVR timing.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Spinal excitability may undergo adaptive modulation in response to training load, sport-specific demands, and fatigue. While high-impact sports are known to influence reflex responsiveness, the extent to which these changes differ from athletes in lower-impact disciplines remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate post-exercise changes in Hmax/Mmax ratio among trained runners with varied sport backgrounds, and to identify emergent physiological profiles that may reflect differential spinal adaptation to fatigue. Methods: Twenty-two trained athletes underwent unilateral H-reflex testing before and after treadmill running performed to voluntary exhaustion. Amplitudes of the H-reflex and M-wave were recorded, and Hmax/Mmax ratios were analyzed. Based on a physiologically relevant threshold commonly used to distinguish normal from suppressed reflex amplitudes, participants were post hoc classified into three groups: Group A (pre- and post-test ratios above threshold), Group B (pre above, post below), and Group C (both below). A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA was used to assess between-group effects. Results: Significant differences were found across groups and conditions (p &lt; 0.001). Group A maintained reflex ratios above the threshold, indicating stable excitability. Group B showed the greatest suppression (approximately 66%), transitioning from normal to subthreshold values. Group C remained consistently below-threshold. A significant interaction (p &lt; 0.0001) confirmed that reflex modulation varied by physiological profile. A small but statistically significant reduction in H-reflex latency was also observed; however, this change remained within normal physiological variability. Conclusions: Postexercise H-reflex modulation revealed heterogeneous neuromuscular responses among athletes. These findings may contribute to understanding how sport-specific demands and fatigue shape spinal excitability and may help identify individuals with adaptive or potentially pathological profiles relevant to sports diagnostics.",

We evaluated disproportional reporting of acute kidney injury (AKI) and tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) with PPIs in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) from 2020 to 2025. Methods: FAERS reports were screened using MedDRA Preferred Terms. Report characteristics and annual counts of AKI and TIN reports were summarized. Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR), Proportional Reporting Ratio (PRR), Empirical Bayes Geometric Mean (EBGM), and Information Content (IC) were used to assess disproportionality. Results: We identified 13,654 PPI-associated AKI reports and 2409 TIN reports in FAERS (2020–2025). Reports were predominantly from the United States, and missing age/sex information was common. Hospitalization was reported in 12.3% of AKI and 22.7% of TIN reports, and death in 9.1% and 5.0%, respectively. Across all years, disproportionality analyses using ROR, PRR, EBGM, and IC consistently met signal thresholds for both outcomes, with stronger signals in 2020–2022 and attenuation thereafter alongside declining report counts. Conclusions: FAERS data show persistent disproportional reporting of AKI and TIN with PPI use. Causality cannot be inferred, but the findings support cautious, indication-based PPI prescribing and highlight the need for robust studies to clarify renal safety.",

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) with left-to-right shunt could serve as a left atrium unloading factor. The aim of the study was to test whether PFO in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is linked to lower left atrial pressure (LAP). Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on consecutive patients undergoing AF ablation from 2019 to 2023. The presence of PFO was assessed with standard transesophageal echocardiography, performed in all patients before ablation. LAP was measured directly in the left atrium just after transseptal puncture. Mean LAP was analyzed. Results: A total of 409 patients were included in the analysis, 85 of whom had PFO (20.8%). There were no significant differences between the groups in baseline characteristics such as age, sex, and comorbidities. Overall, 34.4% of patients had a history of heart failure, independent of the presence of a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Mean LAP was not significantly different between patients with and without PFO (p = 0.36). Conclusions: In patients undergoing AF ablation, more than 20% of patients have PFO. The presence of PFO does not significantly influence LAP, measured directly in the left atrium. The presence of PFO is not linked to a lower prevalence of heart failure.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic disturbances. Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is closely linked to metabolic regulation and has been shown to differ between individuals with and without MASLD. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the associations between SHBG and MASLD and their relationships with insulin resistance, body mass index (BMI), age, and sex in a combined male–female cohort. Patients and Methods: We studied 98 men and 54 women with MASLD and 74 men and 55 women without MASLD (aged 25–64 years). Participants underwent abdominal ultrasonography and fasting blood sampling, including measurements of glucose, liver enzymes, lipids, insulin, SHBG, estradiol, and testosterone. Results: SHBG levels were lower in individuals with MASLD than in controls, with a more pronounced reduction in women. MASLD status was associated with an approximately 10 nmol/L lower SHBG concentration (p &lt; 0.0001; gender × MASLD interaction p = 0.0462). Higher estradiol levels were associated with higher SHBG concentrations (p = 0.0009), although this association differed by sex (gender × log-estradiol interaction p = 0.0147). Older age and higher total cholesterol levels were associated with higher SHBG levels, whereas higher triglyceride levels were associated with lower SHBG levels. Conclusions: SHBG showed significant associations with MASLD and with key metabolic and hormonal factors, including BMI, age, and sex. Inclusion of both men and women extends prior male-only research and provides a broader characterisation of sex-specific associations in MASLD.",

    "Abstract": "Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are two powerful modalities which can be used in the clinical setting to produce data for the creation of patient-specific finite element analysis (FEA) models and physical analogues—for instance, by using additive manufacturing (AM)—that mimic the properties of soft and hard tissues, both morphologically and mechanically. However, there remains a gap between creating a perfect biofidelic physical analogue and its computational counterpart. This gap exists because, firstly, in silico models are often too complex to realise, and secondly, real-life conditions are challenging to emulate both computationally and mechanically, as they involve multiscale situations that are inherently heterogeneous and patient specific. In this study, we applied a multi-scale approach to design and model porcine vertebral specimens. Our results identified critical design factors that affect the quality and accuracy of the models, specifically highlighting that scanning resolution/fidelity and the thresholding technique have a directly proportional impact on model accuracy. A small shift up and down the greyscale level by 20 units can affect the behaviour of the AM sample by as much as [−15% +47%]. Working up the levels for manufacturing, testing and modelling (i) cylindrical cores to (ii) whole vertebrae and then (iii) a whole spine motion segment, we observed that the fidelity of predictions reduces, and errors increase as the structure becomes more complicated and intricate (3.6%, 7.5% and 15%, respectively). We are confident that further material-level developments will provide solutions for the more intricate parts of spinal motion segments, such as the intervertebral discs and facets, which in their natural form are highly sophisticated structures. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a holistic multiscale approach has been implemented to produce AM biofidelic analogues of skeletal parts. Our data showed good agreement between the physical and in silico models, confirming that it is possible to model real-time objects and situations both physically and in silico. This ultimately will enable the development of accurate, patient-specific physical models for use in biomechanical testing and medicolegal applications.",

    "Abstract": "Golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) ranks among the most commercially important and high-yield marine finfish species in Chinese mariculture. In response to the requirement for monitoring fish in aquaculture, this study employed Adaptive Resolution Imaging Sonar (ARIS) to observe the body length, swimming speed, and spatial distribution of untreated (GI group), anesthetized (GII group), and injured (GIII group) T. ovatus in a small offshore cage (1.5 × 1.5 × 2.5 m3). The results demonstrated that the relative error range of the length measurement of the T. ovatus spanned from −3.24 to 4.35, and there was no significant difference between the observed and actual body lengths (ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05). We failed to detect a significant difference in the average speed between the untreated group and the anesthetized group (ANOVA, p &gt; 0.05; Tukey’s HSD, p &gt; 0.05). The injured fish exhibited a significantly lower swimming speed compared to untreated and anesthetized individuals (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.01; Tukey’s HSD, p &lt; 0.01). Untreated individuals and fish with physical injuries exhibited mean vertical distribution depths of 1.06 ± 0.47 m and 1.70 ± 0.51 m, respectively, with the injured fish occupying a significantly greater water depth than the untreated conspecifics (one-way ANOVA, p &lt; 0.01). There was a highly significant association between the treatment status of the fish (untreated/injured) and the frequency of water layer distribution (χ2(2) = 196.78, p &lt; 0.01). The findings of the present study can furnish specific methodological references for the imaging sonar-based monitoring of T. ovatus within aquaculture cage systems. Nevertheless, the study is subject to several inherent limitations, including a small sample size for the injured group (n = 3), the employment of an artificial injury model, and the confinement of experimental subjects to a closed cage environment; these factors may introduce statistical uncertainty and thus exert a considerable impact on the external validity of the study’s results.",

    "Abstract": "Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are among the most structurally diverse classes of crystalline nanomaterials, offering exceptional tunability, porosity, and chemical modularity. These characteristics have positioned MOFs as promising platforms for nanomedicine, bioimaging, and integrated nanotheranostic applications. However, the rational design of MOFs that satisfy stringent biomedical requirements, including high drug loading capacity, controlled and stimuli responsive release, selective targeting, physiological stability, biodegradability, and multimodal imaging capability, remains challenging due to the vast combinatorial design space and the complex interplay between physicochemical properties and biological responses. The objective of this review is to critically examine recent advances in artificial intelligence approaches based on Transformer architectures for the design and optimization of MOFs aimed at next-generation nanotheranostics. In contrast to prior reviews that broadly survey machine learning methods for MOF research, this article focuses specifically on Transformer-based models and their ability to capture long-range, hierarchical, and multiscale relationships governing MOF structure, chemistry, and functional behavior. We review state-of-the-art models, including MOFormer, MOFNet, MOFTransformer, and Uni MOF, and discuss graph-based and sequence-based representations used to encode MOF topology and composition. This review highlights how Transformer-based models enable predictive assessment of properties directly relevant to nanotheranostic performance, such as adsorption energetics, framework stability, diffusion pathways, pore accessibility, and surface functionality. By explicitly linking these predictive capabilities to drug delivery efficiency, imaging performance, targeted therapeutic action, and combined diagnostic and therapeutic applications, this work delineates the specific contribution of Transformer-based artificial intelligence to biomedical translation. Finally, we discuss emerging opportunities and remaining challenges, including generative Transformer models for inverse MOF design, self-supervised learning on hybrid experimental and computational datasets, and integration with autonomous synthesis and screening workflows. By defining the scope, novelty, and contribution of Transformer-based design strategies, this review provides a focused roadmap for accelerating the development of MOF-based platforms for next-generation nanotheranostics.",

    "Abstract": "Although RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) enables rapid transcriptome profiling, functional annotation of fungal transcriptomes remains challenging. Existing tools prioritize broad taxonomic coverage, and reference genomes are scarce for non-model species. This study aimed to develop a fungal-specific functional annotation workflow to support rapid and accurate functional analyses downstream of RNA-seq, independent of reference genome availability. To evaluate the workflow, RNA-seq data from 57 samples of Lentinula edodes strain H600 (shiitake mushroom) were retrieved, along with full-length transcript sequencing (Iso-Seq) data and corresponding RNA-seq data from 20 samples of Phakopsora pachyrhizi (Asian soybean rust) from public databases. The workflow successfully annotated over 96% of protein-coding transcripts and demonstrated applicability to Iso-Seq data. Functional enrichment analyses revealed higher-resolution functional detection than existing annotation tools. Furthermore, integrating homology searches against fungal-specific databases with expression pattern-based annotations highlighted the workflow’s utility for target identification in genome editing and other applications. Overall, the results of this study highlight the potential of the developed workflow in facilitating the discovery of functionally important transcripts and their translation into biotechnological applications.",

    "Abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms can modulate susceptibility to mercury (Hg) toxicity by altering metabolic and detoxification pathways. This review evaluated the association between genetic variants, Hg exposure, and obstetric outcomes. A systematic search of Scopus, PubMed and ScienceDirect through May 2025 identified 12 eligible studies (n = 4995), conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines, with methodological quality assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Meta-analysis was selectively performed only for genetically and methodologically comparable studies. The most frequently examined genes were GSTP1, GCLC, GCLM, GPX1, MT1A, ALAD, and APOE. Meta-analysis of GSTP1 rs1695, showed no statistically significant association between the Val105 allele and hair mercury concentrations (MD = −0.08 µg/g; 95% CI: −0.18 to 0.02; p = 0.13), although the direction of effect suggested a potential protective trend. Polymorphisms in other glutathione-related genes (GCLC, GCLM, and GPX1) were consistently associated with increased risks of small-for-gestational-age infants, preeclampsia, and impaired neurodevelopmental outcomes in offspring. In contrast, the APOE ε4 allele appeared to be associated with reduced fetal mercury burden, whereas polymorphisms in ALAD and MT1A were linked to higher mercury levels and adverse pregnancy-related outcomes. By integrating epidemiological evidence with mechanistic insights within a gene–environment interaction framework, this review helps to address important gaps in the existing literature. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating genetic susceptibility into Hg risk assessment and precision-based prenatal interventions.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: New guidelines for management of metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) patients recommend an individualized medicine approach mainly targeting patients with fibrotic metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and metabolic risk factors for progression of disease. This cohort study reports real-world experience for the individual evaluation and final diagnosis of patients on suspicion of fibrotic MASH according to standardized international criteria. We aimed to identify patients with significant fibrosis (F2–F4). Methods: Adult patients with metabolic syndrome and/or elevated alanine aminotransferases (ALT &gt; 50) referred in a 5-year period (2018–2022) on suspicion of fibrotic MASH were included. Medical history, anthropometric measurements, and routine (blood tests, ultrasound) and specific examinations were applied. Liver biopsy was offered for definite diagnosis and to evaluate MASLD characteristics. Patient demographics and characteristics as well as the absolute number and proportion of patients with definite MASLD and fibrotic MASH are reported. Results: A total of 137 adult patients were included. Ten percent of patients were evaluated without liver biopsy and diagnosed with chronic liver diseases other than MASLD. Liver-biopsied patients (n = 123) had a mean age (SD) of 49 (14) years, and 50% were males. Overweight or obesity was present in 94%, dyslipidemia in 74%, hypertension in 40%, and type 2 diabetes mellitus in 34%. Of all 137 patients, 104 (76%) were diagnosed with definite MASLD and 80 (58%) with definite MASH. A total of 74 (54%) patients had definite fibrotic MASH, while 41 (30%) had significant (F2–4) fibrotic MASH. Eight patients (6%) had cirrhotic (F4) MASH. A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that patients with type 2 diabetes, older age, and higher BMI were associated with an apparent increased risk of F2–F4 fibrosis. Conclusions: The majority of referred patients had cardiometabolic–hepatic metabolic risk factors and were diagnosed with definite MASLD. More than half of these were diagnosed with fibrotic MASH. Older age, type 2 diabetes, and higher BMI were apparent risk factors for MASH F2–F4 fibrosis. We conclude that the individual cardiovascular–hepatic risk profile applied supports the new guidelines and may be useful for referral and further evaluation at expert care centers in a real-world setting.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cardiogenic shock is a heterogeneous syndrome in which systemic inflammation may contribute to cardiovascular risk and adverse outcomes beyond hemodynamic compromise alone. Methods: We conducted a retrospective multicenter cohort study using the eICU Collaborative Research Database (2014–2015) to identify inflammatory phenotypes among adults admitted to intensive care units with cardiogenic shock. Inflammatory indices derived from admission hematologic parameters (including NLR, PLR, MLR, NPAR, SII, SIRI, and AISI) were analyzed using principal component analysis, followed by hierarchical and k-means clustering to identify biologically distinct inflammatory phenotypes. Clinical characteristics and short-term outcomes were compared across clusters. Results: Among 419 patients, two phenotypes were identified. Cluster 1 (n = 52) was characterized by older age, a higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD), more advanced renal and hepatic dysfunction, along with a hyperinflammatory, lymphopenic profile. Cluster 2 (n = 367) exhibited comparatively lower inflammatory indices and less biochemical derangement. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of CKD, the need for mechanical ventilation, and history of malignancy between clusters. Despite clear biological separation, short-term clinical outcomes, including rates of acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy, vasopressor use, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality, were similar across clusters. Conclusions: These findings suggest that cardiogenic shock encompasses distinct inflammatory phenotypes, but inflammatory clustering based on routine admission laboratory data alone may have limited utility for short-term risk stratification.",

    "Abstract": "Male infertility contributes substantially to couple infertility, and a large proportion of cases remain idiopathic. Dysbiosis within the gut, seminal, and urinary microbiomes has been associated with impaired semen parameters, reproductive tract inflammation, and oxidative stress. This narrative review, informed by a structured literature search, summarizes current evidence for the gut–testis axis and the androbactome in male infertility and discusses mechanistic pathways linking microbial imbalance to sperm dysfunction. Proposed mechanisms include immune activation, increased oxidative stress, endocrine and metabolic perturbations, and disruption of epithelial barriers, including the blood–testis barrier. Early clinical trials report that selected probiotic or synbiotic formulations may be associated with improvements in one or more World Health Organization (WHO) semen parameters and with reductions in oxidative or inflammatory biomarkers (surrogate laboratory endpoints; pregnancy and live-birth outcomes are rarely reported and remain unproven) in selected populations, such as idiopathic infertility and the post-varicocelectomy setting. Given patient heterogeneity, a personalized approach requires prespecified clinical phenotypes and measurable monitoring targets, rather than indiscriminate supplementation. At present, probiotics should be considered an adjunct rather than a stand-alone therapy. Well-designed, contamination-aware microbiome studies and adequately powered randomized trials with clinically meaningful endpoints, including pregnancy and live birth, are required before routine clinical implementation. This synthesis is intended to support personalized counseling and trial design by clarifying candidate phenotypes, appropriate monitoring endpoints, and realistic limitations of current evidence.",

We construct an unbalanced panel dataset by integrating textual analysis, manual verification, and data merged from nine major databases, identifying 411 AI-classified MNEs and a matched 411 non-AI MNEs. Using panel regression models with industry and year fixed effects, we test how AI intensity (the proportion of AI-related products/assets) and R&amp;D—individually and jointly—affect product portfolio breadth and change, market share, industry concentration (HHI), and profitability. The results show that greater AI integration is associated with higher product diversification and a stronger competitive positioning, and that the interaction of AI and R&amp;D is particularly important for explaining market share, concentration, and profitability differences across AI and non-AI MNEs. Overall, the findings highlight the strategic value of aligning AI adoption with innovation investments to strengthen product market outcomes and financial performance in global markets.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate identification of built-up land from remotely sensed imagery is essential for urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. However, binary built-up maps derived from single-date classifications often contain semantic noise—misclassified pixels resulting from shadows, bare soil confusion, or seasonal conditions. Common denoising methodologies, such as smoothing or filtering, are designed for continuous imagery and can distort small or fragmented features and fail to correct underlying classification errors. To overcome these limitations, this study evaluated a multi-date summation and thresholding workflow as a denoising alternative. Five Sentinel-2 images per site were classified as built-up maps, summed into a composite “built-up frequency” raster, and thresholded using Otsu, adaptive, and voting methods to produce refined binary maps. The results across nine international study sites show that the Otsu thresholding method outperformed the other methods in most locations when comparing their accuracies using the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), showing that using multiple images can improve identification of built-up land.",

    "Abstract": "Green space (GS) exposure reflects how well urban dwellers engage with GSs, which is closely related to sustainable communities. However, the associations between GS exposure and multi-dimensional social vulnerability (SoV) remain to be elucidated. To address this gap, this study develops a comprehensive framework to investigate the associations between GS exposure and SoV using methods of the Gini coefficient, bivariate mapping, and discriminant analysis, taking the Xuhui District of Shanghai as a case study. The results show the following findings. (1) The GS exposure was improved by good accessibility of GSs, particularly for the downtowns suffering a low level of GS availability; (2) The distribution of GS exposure is relatively equitable across different levels of SoV; (3) Communities with low GS exposure and high SoV are characterized by a high proportion of children and a low proportion of highly educated and employed people. The findings highlight the necessity of a systematic evaluation of GS exposure from a SoV perspective. Such a systematic evaluation could help optimize the GS patterns and allocate the valuable GSs to vulnerable groups for a more inclusive and sustainable community.",

It employs the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) Habitat Quality Model to project current and future habitat quality and degradation. Findings confirm that nickel mining significantly threatens habitat quality. Under a future scenario, 10% (513 km2) of excellent-quality habitat is projected to be lost across the study area. Specifically, mining zones face severe degradation and a future absence of excellent habitat, though protected areas are expected to maintain excellent quality. The study highlights Indonesia’s core dilemma between economic nickel dominance and severe environmental destruction, stressing the need for equitable global risk-sharing.

    "Abstract": "Objective: We aimed to characterize the somatic mutational landscape of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and identify potential genomic drivers of tumor progression and therapeutic resistance using the AACR GENIE database. Study Design: Retrospective genomic analysis was employed. Setting: We used publicly available data from the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Project GENIE database accessed via cBioPortal. Methods: We analyzed 412 tumor samples from 401 patients diagnosed with OPSCC. Somatic mutations, clinical variables and tumor characteristics were extracted and analyzed. Statistical comparisons of mutation frequencies across gender and tumor stage (primary vs. metastatic) were conducted. Co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity analyses were performed to identify significant genomic patterns. Results: The most frequently mutated genes included TP53 (30.1%), PIK3CA (26.0%), and KMT2D (21.6%). Gender-specific analyses suggested potential enrichment of TP53 and MET mutations in females and of ZNF750 in males. Distinct mutation patterns were observed between primary and metastatic tumors; primary tumors were enriched for mutations in TP53 and CDKN2A, while metastatic lesions harbored unique alterations in genes like CBLB and BUB1B, suggesting pathways involved in immune evasion and chromosomal instability may drive disease progression. Co-occurrence was noted between PIK3CA and FBXW7, and mutual exclusivity between TP53 and CYLD. Conclusions: This study identifies distinct genomic signatures in OPSCC subgroups, highlighting candidate biomarkers in pathways like PI3K/AKT signaling that warrant further investigation. Validating these markers in prospective trials is a critical next step to translate these findings into personalized therapeutic strategies for OPSCC patients.",

Knowing that the hydroxyl group, as a strong H-bond donor in halogenated hydroxypyridines, usually directs supramolecular packing and might enforce possible halogen–halogen contacts, we crystallized 2-iodo-3-acetoxypyridine with the aim of disrupting the most important H-bond donor and assessing the propensity of the iodine for halogen bond formation. Indeed, in the compound 2-iodopyridin-3-yl acetate, the crystal packing is characterized by infinite 3D chains bonded through I···O=C and C-H···I contacts between adjacent molecules. These chains are interconnected by weak C-H···O contacts, implying the presence of oxygen in the ester. The I···H contact with the C-H axis perpendicular to the electron belt of the iodine atom can enhance the σ-hole of the iodine and act cooperatively in crystal cohesion. No halogen–halogen contacts were present.",

    "Abstract": "This study explores novel silica gel/sulfonated polymer composite coatings for enhanced thermal management in electric vehicles via sorption technology. Leveraging the cost-effectiveness of silica gel as a filler and a readily available, water vapor-permeable sulfonated polymer as the matrix, we developed and characterized these materials. Mechanical assessments revealed varied performance: coatings with lower silica gel content (80 and 85 wt%) demonstrated suitable scratch resistance (damage width ~1100 µm at 1300 g load) and superior impact resistance (damage diameter ~2.4 mm). Pull-off adhesion strengths for these batches were 1.26 MPa and 1.36 MPa, respectively, though higher filler loading (90 and 95 wt%) led to a ~30% reduction and a shift to cohesive failure for high-filler-content batches. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed thermal stability up to 280 °C. Adsorption studies revealed that the composite coating with 95 wt% of silica gel achieved the highest water uptake (just under 30 wt%), with all batches exhibiting capacities comparable to commercial adsorbents. This comprehensive characterization confirms that these composites offer a compelling balance of mechanical robustness, reliable adhesion, and high adsorption efficiency, positioning them as promising, cost-effective solutions for EV thermal management.",

    "Abstract": "The effective isolation of high-concentration dust during mining and transportation processes is a hot issue of occupational health concern for workers. Based on the characteristics of graphene and its derivatives, a new type of mining mask made of graphene oxide polypropylene composite material (GO polypropylene composite material) and reduced graphene oxide polypropylene composite material (rGO polypropylene composite material) was prepared using the direct impregnation method. Moreover, particle filtration performance tests were conducted under different gas flow conditions. The results showed that, at the same concentration, the reduction group (rGO polypropylene composite material) had more compliance indicators, and the comprehensive performance ranking was as follows: reduction group (rGO polypropylene composite material) &gt; oxidation group (GO polypropylene composite material) &gt; control group (polypropylene composite material). The reduction group with a concentration of 0.3 g/L showed the best overall performance. At a flow rate of 1.0 m3/h, the filtration efficiency of PM10 (95.61%) and PM2.5 (95.01%) met the relevant standards, while PM1.0 (94.88%) was close to the standard threshold (with a difference of only −0.12%), significantly better than the control (PM10, 93.39%) and the oxidation (PM10, 95.01%) groups. Moreover, at various flow rates, its particulate matter concentration was significantly lower than that for the oxidation and control groups. Overall, it meets the requirements of providing ideal filtration effects under different work intensities (low, medium, and high flow rates), thus providing strong technical support for individual protection of mine workers and a theoretical basis and practical guidance for reducing occupational diseases caused by dust exposure in mines.",

    "Abstract": "Inkjet printing technology shows significant potential for producing high-performance conductive circuits in printed electronics. However, conventional silver nanoparticle (Ag NP) inks often face challenges such as nozzle clogging, poor stability, and low conductivity after low-temperature sintering. While most existing studies focus solely on dispersant selection or individual process optimization, few have systematically explored the synergistic effects of particle size distribution, dispersion methods, and dispersant dosage. This study proposes a sequential optimization approach involving centrifugal classification to identify an optimal Ag NPs source and size distribution, followed by comparison and optimization of different dispersion methods. Furthermore, the effects of dispersant (a PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer) concentration and application strategy (individual or combined use) on the rheological properties and conductivity of the ink were systematically investigated. The optimized Ag NP ink demonstrated excellent jetting stability with no nozzle clogging, exhibiting a surface tension of 19.60 mN/m and a viscosity of 6.83 mPa·s. After low-temperature sintering at 260 °C on glass or polyimide (PI) substrates, the printed patterns achieved a high electrical conductivity of 1.506 × 107 S/m. Printing on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at 150 °C confirmed compatibility with heat-sensitive flexible substrates. This work offers a comprehensive and practical strategy for developing highly reliable and conductive Ag NP inks, facilitating their application in next-generation printed electronics.",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates the impact of a comprehensive design integrating precursor type, reduction and freeze-casting on the development of aerogels with high sorption capacity for engine oil. In this respect, the graphene oxide was varied from commercial to expanded; the reduction approach relied either on purely hydrothermal or combined hydrothermal–chemical reduction approaches. Following the synthesis, freeze-casting was applied at −5 °C and −196 °C. To further improve the reduction degree, annealing in an inert atmosphere was employed upon drying. The effects of precursors, reduction approach, freeze-casting and annealing were systematically investigated. Characterization techniques, including FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, and EDS, were used to correlate the degree of reduction and morphological features of the porous structure with the absorption properties. The use of expanded GO as a precursor yielded aerogels with more homogeneous three-dimensional networks, a reduced bulk density of 3 mg cm−3, and lower oxygen-containing functional group content, thereby achieving consistently superior oil absorption of 270 g g−1, with an oil occupancy of 94%. The process was found to fit well with the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The results demonstrate that a comprehensive approach—considering combined reduction, freeze-casting, and thermal annealing—enables the tailored optimization of both the structure and absorption performance of GO aerogels for the remediation of oil spills.",

    "Abstract": "Modular reconfigurable robots exhibit significant potential in adapting to complex terrains through cooperative multi-robot formations. However, current control systems often struggle to maintain consistent performance when the number of modules varies due to a lack of unified and adaptive control frameworks. Existing Virtual Model Control (VMC) methods, while effective for fixed-configuration legged robots, are limited in their ability to dynamically adjust control parameters in reconfigurable multi-legged systems. To address this gap, this study proposes a parallel multi-legged control system that integrates a Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) with a decoupled VMC framework. The BPNN enables adaptive tuning of motion parameters under varying modular configurations, while the decoupled VMC ensures stable gait control under force feedback. Simulation and physical experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves a unified control architecture across quadrupedal and multi-legged configurations, with improved tracking accuracy, stability, and adaptability compared to traditional VMC methods.",

    "Abstract": "Research on tannin-based foams has shown promising results. However, all developments in this field have not been addressed from different perspectives, in a systematic way, and with an emphasis on sustainability. This work discusses different formulations, emphasizing their bio-based components and how modifications influence key properties. It examines life cycle assessment (LCA) studies through a sustainability lens and identifies major commercial phenolic products to highlight the practical use of tannin foams for thermal insulation. The type of tannins, as well as their sources, influences the key properties of these foams. The replacement of formaldehyde, a crosslinking agent known for its health risks, is possible, particularly through more sustainable alternatives that allow for foams with better properties than those obtained with formaldehyde. Substitution of diethyl ether with less hazardous alternatives results in foams with improved thermal and mechanical performance. The elimination of the blowing agent—the green alternative—also leads to foams with good performance. The presence of additives (surfactants, plasticizers, and fillers), some of which are sustainable, improves the mechanical properties of the foams. The performance in fire-related applications, already promising, is also enhanced by the presence of additives. An increase in understanding, combined with the sustainable nature of the various alternatives, makes tannin-based foams promising candidates for next-generation insulation and structural materials in construction.",

    "Abstract": "Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was adopted to manufacture AlSi10Mg, and two post-processing schedules, T4 (510 °C/2 h + water quench) and T6 (T4 + 180 °C/6 h), were applied to elucidate how Si precipitation size controls ductility. The as-built alloy consisted of an α-Al matrix with a grid-like eutectic Si network and achieved UTS &gt; 480 MPa but exhibited build-direction-dependent tensile anisotropy. Heat treatment promoted Si precipitation from the supersaturated α-Al matrix and transformed the eutectic network via fragmentation, spheroidization, and Ostwald ripening, leading to pronounced softening and improved elongation. After T4, the yield strength and UTS decreased by &gt;50%, while elongation increased from 10.9% to 22.27%; T6 provided a slight strength recovery accompanied by a marginal ductility reduction. Mechanistically, a high number density of fine Si precipitates enhances dislocation storage and delays damage accumulation, whereas coarse, non-shearable Si particles intensify local strain gradients, facilitate void nucleation at the matrix/particle interface, and accelerate fracture. Overall, tailoring Si precipitation/coarsening offers an effective route to improve ductility and mitigate anisotropy in LPBF AlSi10Mg.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents an end-to-end simulation methodology for evaluating package-induced signal integrity (SI) degradation in a peripheral component interconnect express (PCIe) 5.0 channel. By integrating package, printed circuit board (PCB), and add-in card (AIC) structures into a unified simulation flow, the proposed approach enables accurate assessment of system-level eye diagram degradation. Various package-level degradation factors, such as impedance mismatch, meander routing, and via stubs, are assumed and designed to analyze their individual and combined effects on insertion loss, intra-pair skew, and eye diagrams. Results show that even localized discontinuities inside the package propagate and compound through the end-to-end channel, causing a significant reduction in the eye diagram at the system level. These findings demonstrate that package-induced impairments cannot be evaluated solely at the package level but must instead be analyzed within a complete end-to-end channel environment. The proposed methodology provides a practical framework for predicting system-level SI degradation caused by package design choices, offering valuable insights for next-generation high-speed package and channel co-design.",

    "Abstract": "This work presents a millimeter-wave half-mode substrate integrated waveguide filter with high selectivity, using through glass via technology. Compared to a traditional printed circuit board, the benefits of high precision and integration afforded by the glass-based process enable the substrate-integrated waveguide to be employed at a higher operating frequency. A novel negative coupling structure is proposed for achieving a quasi-elliptic function response, and its coupling mechanism is investigated to explore the properties of the finite transmission zeros. The proposed coupling slots allow for flexible adjustment of the coupling between the half-mode substrate integrated waveguide cavities from positive to negative by modulating the corresponding geometrical parameters. As a prototype, a glass-based fourth-order bandpass filter is synthesized, simulated, fabricated and measured. Subsequently, good matching is captured, confirming the validity of the topology. The proposed glass-based negative coupling structure is promising for realizing substrate integrated waveguide filters with a quasi-elliptic function response, especially operating at millimeter-wave band.",

    "Abstract": "Wire explosion (WE) inherently generates particle ensembles spanning the nano- to microscale, posing challenges for conventional characterization methods in terms of capturing the full particle population. To address this issue, spectrophotometric analysis combined with algorithmic spectrum reconstruction based on Mie theory and constrained distribution models were employed to characterize copper WE products formed in aqueous surroundings within the 4–12 kV discharge voltage range. Three independent fitting strategies, specifically a semimanual fitting, an evolutionary algorithm, and a grid search, were applied to retrieve the size distributions and relative shares of copper and copper oxide particles as a function of discharge voltage. Based on experimental and theoretical findings, lognormal and normal distributions across the 10–300 nm diameter range were assumed as constraints for oxide and metallic fractions, respectively. The reconstructed metallic copper population exhibited mean diameters ranging from 123 to 181 nm, while oxidized fractions followed lognormal distributions centred near 10 nm mode diameters. Voltage-dependent trends revealed an optimal discharge regime between 6 kV and 8 kV, where the exploded fraction reached approximately 63% and the metallic mass share exceeded 80%. These results confirmed that spectrophotometry represents an essential tool for the quantitative characterization of such complex, wide-range systems.",

Phenotypic identification by API and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry identified bacterial isolates as Limosilactobacillus sp.

The isolates were evaluated for their functional properties, including antimicrobial activity, autoaggregation, antioxidative potential, resistance to freeze-drying, survival in simulated saliva and GIT conditions, adhesion to Caco-2 and HaCaT cell lines, and biofilm-forming ability. Lcb. rhamnosus S3 demonstrated the highest probiotic potential, characterized by strong inhibition of S. aureus, high autoaggregation capacity, substantial survival following freeze-drying, and good tolerance to simulated saliva and GIT conditions. Limosilactobacillus sp. (S1) demonstrated the strongest antimicrobial activity against C. acnes and the highest adhesion capacity to HaCaT cells, indicating its suitability for topical dermatological applications. Although S. cerevisiae isolates did not exhibit antimicrobial activity, they showed strong autoaggregation and notable antioxidant capacity.

All diagnostic tests received at a tertiary referral hospital between 2000 and 2024 were reviewed: urea breath test, gastric biopsy culture, string test, and stool antigen detection. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the E-test gradient diffusion method. Out of 2855 children investigated, 26.9 were infected with H. pylori. Eradication control was performed in 62.5% (n = 480) of cases. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was achieved in 96.5% out of the 400 isolates studied. All isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin and tetracyclines. Primary resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole, and levofloxacin was 28.9%, 19.4%, and 8.9%, respectively, and secondary resistance was 38.7%, 29.7%, and 5.9%, respectively. H.pylori infection remains a challenge in pediatric patients, and the high resistance observed to clarithromycin and metronidazole makes it necessary to monitor the susceptibility of H.pylori and confirms the need for targeted treatment.",

    "Abstract": "The global challenge of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been framed primarily in terms of genetic resistance mechanisms. Nevertheless, bacteria can also survive antimicrobial stress through phenotypic plasticity, resulting in transient, non-genetic states such as tolerance, persistence, and population-level resilience. These phenotypic states complicate diagnostic efforts, diminish antibiotic efficacy, and contribute to the chronic nature of infections even in the absence of heritable resistance. This review evaluates phenotypic plasticity as a significant yet underrecognized factor in AMR, with a focus on responses to oxidative and photodynamic stress. Key manifestations of plasticity are discussed, including morphological and metabolic remodeling such as filamentation, small-colony variants, and metabolic rewiring, as well as envelope- and biofilm-associated heterogeneity and regulatory flexibility mediated by gene networks and horizontal regulatory transfer. The review highlights plastic responses elicited by reactive oxygen species-mediated stress and antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation, where single-cell heterogeneity, biofilm and mucus barriers, and light-dependent cues influence bacterial survival. Case studies are presented to demonstrate how photodynamic strategies can induce transient protective states and act synergistically with antibiotics, revealing mechanisms of action that extend beyond conventional single-target therapeutic models. Drawing on evidence from single-cell analyses, biofilm ecology, and experimental evolution, this review establishes phenotypic plasticity as a central element in the chemical biology of AMR. Enhanced understanding of plasticity is essential for advancing diagnostics, informing the development of adjuvant therapies, and predicting bacterial responses to novel antimicrobial interventions.",

The S-OMS consisted of an electrochemical cell in which a microdevice was 3D-printed with co-polyester filaments and used an internal silver/silver sulfide (Ag/Ag2S) working electrode and a commercial, external silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference electrode. The analytical evaluation showed a wide linear range (1.5–30,400 mg L−1) with repeatability and reproducibility presenting relative standard deviations of less than 5%. The S-OMS remained stable during working periods ranging from 16 h to 8 days, depending on the operation mode. Real samples from a sulfate-reducing bioreactor were used to validate the S-OMS, and the results were compared with those of a commercial sulfide ion-selective electrode (S2−-ISE), yielding a good linear correlation (R2 = 0.92). Moreover, a t-test revealed no significant statistical difference between the two analytical methods. The bioreactor operation resulted in a high sulfate reduction rate and in the accumulation of total sulfide, as measured with the S-OMS, in the bioreactor. However, the H2S inhibition was offset by an increase in pH and volatile suspended solids (VSS) throughout the operation. Overall, the S-OMS demonstrated robust analytical performance and operational suitability for online monitoring of sulfide in sulfide-producing bioreactors.",

    "Abstract": "Colloidal solutions containing silica-coated silver nanoparticles (Ag@SiO2) were synthesized through a two-step process integrating physical and chemical mechanisms. In the first step, laser ablation of a silicon target submerged in deionized water generated an H2O–SiO2 colloid, termed the as-cast colloid. This contained nanometric SiO2 particles alongside micrometer-sized or larger silicon fragments produced by laser shockwave-induced target surface fragmentation. To refine particle size distribution and elevate nanometric SiO2 concentration, the as-cast colloid underwent secondary laser irradiation, effectively fragmenting larger particles. The second step involved adding ionic silver to both as-cast and irradiated colloids, yielding Ag@SiO2 nanoparticles. Structural properties were probed via XRD and TEM; optical characteristics via UV–Vis spectroscopy; and electrophoretic mobility via zeta potential measurements, both pre- and post-silver incorporation, to elucidate irradiation’s influence on synthesis. For controlled agglomeration, AlCl3 was used to modify surface charge, neutralizing silanol groups on the silica shell and minimizing electrostatic repulsion through aluminum ion interactions. These findings demonstrate tunable Ag@SiO2 colloids with precise surface properties for future development of advanced nanomaterials suitable for microbicidal applications.",

Quantitative surveys were analyzed using logistic regression, adjusting for demographic characteristics. Interviews were analyzed using principles of content analysis. Results: Students reported that UFSM had multiple benefits, and many students perceived that providing free school meals for all helped reduce the stigma associated with school meals, in part through increased participation. Students liked the variety of foods offered, but many did not perceive school meals, especially breakfast, to be “fresh” or “healthy”. Additionally, many students perceived there to be long lunch lines and insufficient time to eat their meals. Conclusions: While students perceived multiple benefits to UFSM, opportunities to further improve the quality of school meals, as well as policies to ensure sufficient lunch period lengths, may be important complements to increase participation and consumption of school meals among rural students.",

    "Abstract": "Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) does not produce homogeneous results, with some patients showing little weight loss after the procedure. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of pre-procedural psychometric questionnaires to predict insufficient weight loss after ESG in patients with obesity. Patient candidates for ESG were requested to complete the following psychometric questionnaires: Short Form-36 (SF-36), Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-R), Binge Eating Scale (BES), Yale Food Addiction Questionnaire (Y-FAS), Eating Attitude Test-26 (EAT-26), and Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11 (BIS-11). The results of the psychometric scores were then compared with the ESG outcome, which was considered a therapeutic failure if the %EWL was less than 30% at 12 months after the follow-up. Thirty-five patients (8 males and 27 females, mean age 49 years, range 21–75 years) were included in this study. At the one-year follow-up, the mean %EWL was 40 ± 43%. Male sex and higher preoperative BMI were identified as risk factors for poor weight loss. A logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex and preoperative BMI showed that low scores on the SF-36 (Subscale Mental Health), high scores on the SCL_90-R, and an elevated BES score were predictors of therapeutic failure. The results of the present study seem to confirm the usefulness of the SF-36, SCL-90R, and BES questionnaires in the selection of patients eligible for ESG.",

    "Abstract": "Precise control and measurement of the cellular microenvironment, particularly oxygen concentration, are crucial for developing physiologically relevant in vitro models. However, current methods often lack the spatial resolution and throughput needed to investigate complex, oxygen-dependent biological mechanisms in 3D cell cultures. Here, we present an advanced platform based on microcavity arrays featuring integrated, ratiometric oxygen sensors, so-called SensoSpheres. A unique bevel design at the cavity entrance enables the non-invasive, real-time measurement of pericellular oxygen concentration and oxygen gradients. We established protocols for generating spheroids from various cell lines (e.g., HepG2, HeLa) and characterized their metabolic responses under precisely controlled hypoxic, normoxic, and hyperoxic conditions. Using a dose–response assay, we demonstrate the platform’s sensitivity in capturing distinct metabolic shifts in response to acetaminophen and cisplatin. Furthermore, we introduce the Oxygen Consumption Recovery Rate (OCRR) as a novel parameter to quantify cellular resilience after exposure to toxic compounds such as cisplatin and acetaminophen. This high-throughput-compatible platform represents a significant methodological advancement, enabling detailed studies of oxygen-dependent cellular processes, drug toxicity, and metabolic adaptation. Its potential for integration into microfluidic systems paves the way for more sophisticated organ-on-chip models, ultimately improving the predictive power of preclinical research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Resistance to HER2-targeted therapies remains a major limitation in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer, where disease progression inevitably occurs in advanced stages. Development of next-generation strategies that retain activity in resistant disease is therefore a critical priority. Disitamab vedotin (RC48) is a novel antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) targeting HER2 that couples a humanized anti-HER2 antibody to the potent microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E. Methods: We compared the activity and mechanism of action of RC48 with that of trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) across HER2-positive and HER2-low cellular models, including multiple sublines resistant to current HER2-targeted agents. Results: In HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, RC48 consistently demonstrated superior antiproliferative effect with respect to T-DM1. Treatment with RC48 induced G2/M arrest and apoptotic cell death, associated with increased pHistone-H3 and cyclin B1 and downregulation of Wee1, consistent with blockade of cell cycle progression in mitosis. Although RC48 and T-DM1 internalized similarly, RC48 displayed more efficient intracellular payload release, providing a mechanistic explanation for its enhanced efficacy. Notably, RC48 retained strong activity in BT474-derived sublines resistant to T-DM1, lapatinib, or neratinib, inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and caspase activation in all resistant models. In contrast, T-DM1 exhibited only partial effects in resistant cells and was completely ineffective in a T-DM1-refractory clone. Conclusions: Together, these findings identify disitamab vedotin as a potent next-generation HER2-targeting ADC with the unique capacity to overcome acquired resistance to HER2-directed therapies. RC48 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for patients with refractory HER2-positive breast cancer and warrants further clinical investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Optical Wireless Power Transmission (OWPT) holds a significant position for enabling cable-free energy delivery in long-distance, high-energy, and mobile scenarios. However, ensuring human and equipment safety under high-power laser exposure remains a critical challenge. This study reports a vision-based OWPT safety system that implements the principle of automatic emission control (AEC)—dynamically modulating laser emission in real time to prevent hazardous exposure. While camera-based OWPT safety systems have been proposed in the concept, there are extremely limited working implementations to date. Moreover, existing systems struggle with response speed and single-object assumptions. To address these gaps, this research presents a low-latency safety architecture based on a customized deep learning-based object detection framework, a dedicated OWPT dataset, and a multi-threaded control stack. The research also introduces a real-time risk factor (RF) metric that evaluates proximity and velocity for each detected intrusion object (IO), enabling dynamic prioritization among multiple threats. The system achieves a minimum response latency of 14 ms (average 29 ms) and maintains reliable performance in complex multi-object scenarios. This work establishes a new benchmark for OWPT safety system and contributes a scalable reference for future development.",

    "Abstract": "Bilberry (Vacciniummyrtillus L., Ericaceae) is chiefly valued as an edible plant for its berries, widely consumed as a functional food, whereas the leaves, as agro-waste, remain an underutilized natural source of bioactives. The traditional use of V. myrtillus leaves is well documented, particularly for managing diabetes and gastrointestinal disorders. However, their potential spasmolytic activity, which could support such uses, remains unexplored. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the spasmolytic potential of V. myrtillus leaf extract on the gastrointestinal tract and to elucidate its underlying mechanism of action. The spray-dried 50% hydroethanolic extract of V. myrtillus leaves, obtained by double percolation, was analyzed using HPLC-DAD. The analysis revealed phenolic acids, with chlorogenic acid as the major compound, and flavonoids, predominantly isoquercitrin. Spasmolytic activity was tested on isolated rat ileum, and the mechanism of action was monitored using models of spontaneous contractions and acetylcholine-, histamine-, CaCl2−, Bay K8644-, L-NAME-, ODQ-, apamin-, BaCl2−, charybdotoxin-, glibenclamide-, TRAM-34-, and quinine-modified contractions. The extract’s activity on isolated ileum strips is primarily mediated via Ca2+ channels, cGMP, histamine, and NO pathways. Overall, this study affirms V. myrtillus leaves as a valuable source of phenolic compounds with potential for treating spasmodic gastrointestinal disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Water scarcity and climate variability threaten citrus production in semi-arid regions, requiring strategies to improve drought resilience. This study evaluated the physiological and hormonal responses of two citrus cultivars, alemow (Citrus macrophylla Wester) and ‘Cleopatra’ mandarin (Citrus reshni Hort. Ex Tanaka), inoculated with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi (Rhizophagus irregularis + Funneliformis mosseae) and subjected to drought stress imposed by progressive soil drying (water withholding) and quantified by volumetric soil water content (θv) classes: &gt;0.20 cm3 cm−3 (well-watered), 0.05–0.20 cm3 cm−3 (moderate drought), and &lt;0.05 cm3 cm−3 (severe drought). Gas exchange, plant water status, and abscisic acid (ABA) dynamics were monitored to assess cultivar-specific effects of AM symbiosis. Under well-watered conditions, +AM plants exhibited higher photosynthetic rates than non-inoculated plants, with a stronger response in Macrophylla. During drought, contrasting patterns emerged: +AM Macrophylla maintained higher stomatal conductance and photosynthesis, with foliar ABA increasing only under severe stress, suggesting that non-hormonal mechanisms support gas exchange. In Cleopatra, AM inoculation was associated with higher root-derived ABA and earlier stomatal closure, suggesting a more conservative water-use strategy under soil drying conditions; however, the benefits were limited to moderate stress and decreased beyond a stomatal conductance threshold. These findings reveal that AM symbiosis enhances drought resilience through contrasting mechanisms: hydraulic stabilization predominates in Macrophylla, whereas hormonal (ABA-mediated) regulation drives the response in Cleopatra. This cultivar-dependent modulation highlights the importance of developing AM-based strategies adapted to each cultivar for effective citrus drought management. Combining AM inoculation with irrigation-saving practices could improve water productivity and support climate-smart citrus production.",

    "Abstract": "Phytochelatin synthases (PCSs) are pivotal enzymes in heavy metal detoxification, yet also implicated in sulfur homeostasis and redox regulation. In this study, we report the molecular and functional characterization of the PCS gene from the green alga Scenedesmus acutus (SaPCS), comparing wild-type and chromium-tolerant strains of this microalga. RT-qPCR, immunoblotting and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that SaPCS expression and protein abundance are primarily regulated by sulfur availability rather than by chromium stress. Two protein isoforms (~70 kDa full-length and ~34 kDa truncated) were detected, both more abundant in the chromium-tolerant strain than the wild-type and responsive to sulfur availability. Furthermore, three alternatively spliced transcript variants (SaPCSa, SaPCSb, SaPCSc) lacking the C-terminal domain coding region but retaining a functional or partially disrupted N-terminal catalytic domain were identified, contributing to the post-transcriptional diversification of PCSs. Mass spectrometry analyses showed negligible phytochelatin production in response to chromium treatment, indicating that detoxification of this metal in S. acutus relies mainly on glutathione (GSH) conjugation and the ascorbate–GSH antioxidant cycle. Overall, these results suggest that SaPCS may promote chromium tolerance by modulating sulfur and redox metabolism rather than by driving phytochelatin accumulation, highlighting the remarkable functional plasticity of PCSs in algal stress responses.",

    "Abstract": "Foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.) possesses characteristics such as strong stress tolerance and high yield. However, weeds compete with foxtail millet, leading to reduced crop yield, degraded quality, and even the promotion of pest and disease spread. Chemical weed control is currently the most practical and feasible method for preventing weed damage in foxtail millet production, but herbicides can harm the main crop, resulting in reduced yield. To investigate the effects of sethoxydim on the growth and development of foxtail millet, this experiment adopted a pot design, setting four concentration gradients for foliar spraying: 0.75, 1.5 (recommended dosage), 3 and 6 L of active ingredient per hectare (L ai ha−1). Sethoxydim treatment hindered electron transport in photosynthesis, leading to a decrease in adenosine triphosphate synthesis and consequently a decline in the photosynthetic parameters of both photosystem I and photosystem II. Meanwhile, the activities and related gene expression of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) and pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) all showed a decreasing trend. In contrast, the activities and related gene expression of NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco); the contents of soluble protein and soluble sugar; and the activities of antioxidant enzymes including malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT), along with their related gene expression, exhibited a trend of first increasing and then decreasing, reaching their peak at a dosage of 1.5 L ai ha−1 (T2 treatment group). Meanwhile, the continuous rise in O2·− and H2O2 contents indicated enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants under herbicide stress. These results show that at the recommended dosage, although sethoxydim causes certain damage to foxtail millet, the plant can maintain certain photosynthetic functions and physiological stability through self-regulation and gradually return to normal.",

    "Abstract": "Smart polymers have attracted significant scientific interest in recent years because of their capability to modify their physical and/or chemical properties in response to external stimuli, including temperature, pH, and electric or magnetic fields. Poly(2-(diethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA) is a pH-responsive polymer with significant potential for biomedical applications. Significant research has focused on the synthesis of PDEAEMA polymers given their potential in smart polymer applications. In this study, PDEAEMA thin films were synthesized via a planar inductively coupled plasma (ICP) system at 13.56 MHz in both continuous and pulsed modes. The effects of substrate temperature, plasma power, and plasma pulse off time on polymer surfaces were systematically studied. The deposited polymer films were analyzed for their chemical composition and structural properties using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Additionally, the plasma environment was analyzed using Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES). Results indicated that polymers prepared under pulsed plasma conditions more closely retained the structure of the monomer. Moreover, the deposition rate increased as the plasma pulse off time decreased in pulsed mode experiments. PDEAEMA-based copolymer films were deposited to investigate their behavior under different pH conditions. The results indicate that the films exhibited distinct responses in acidic and basic environments.",

Enhancing supply chain resilience is thus crucial for sustainable development. This study identifies critical resilience factors and examines their interrelationships within growth-stage cruise shipbuilding supply chains. Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL), Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM), and Matrix Cross-Reference Multiplication Method (MICMAC) analysis are integrated to explore causal linkages, hierarchical structures, and driver-dependence dynamics. The analysis reveals that customized demand responsiveness, learning organization, specialized industrial clusters, and inter-industry collaboration are fundamental causal drivers. In contrast, knowledge stock, risk culture, and final-assembly orchestration serve as critical mediators. Based on these findings, we propose distinct resource-contingent strategic pathways for managers. This study provides an actionable framework for building resilience, offering critical guidance for securing the sustainable development of the cruise shipbuilding industry amid uncertainty.",

    "Abstract": "Synthetic azo dyes are widely used in the textile industry; however, their use often poses environmental challenges. Here, we characterized the compost bacterium Bacillus subtilis strain CKCC for the decolorization of various azo dyes, including Congo Red, Reactive Black 5, Reactive Green 19, Reactive Red 120, and Reactive Blue 4. The application of strain CKCC exhibited high decolorization efficiency by utilizing various extracellular enzymes, including azoreductase and ligninolytic enzymes such as laccase, lignin peroxidase, and manganese peroxidase, which are essential for the decolorization of azo dyes. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis revealed structural changes during decolorization, consistent with the degradation of key functional groups. This transformation was attributed to the cleavage of azo linkages by azoreductase, with ligninolytic enzymes functioning on phenolic and aromatic moieties. While FTIR confirmed these structural changes, our findings only provided insights at the functional-group level, and the presence or absence of specific decolorized metabolites, such as aromatic amines, requires additional analytical techniques. In this study, the phytotoxic metabolites positively affected the germination and growth of Vigna radiata, confirming that decolorization using strain CKCC significantly reduced the toxic properties of the metabolites produced during dye decolorization. Hence, our isolated strain CKCC offers a potentially effective and environmentally sustainable method for treating azo-dye effluent in the textile industry.",

    "Abstract": "Intensive swine production contributes significantly to the global protein supply but generates considerable environmental pressure, particularly through greenhouse gas emissions and surplus slurry management. Anaerobic digestion (AD), especially (co-AD), has been widely investigated as a mitigation strategy to enhance renewable energy generation and nutrient recovery. This systematic review synthesizes life cycle assessment (LCA) studies published between 2019 and 2025 that evaluated AD systems treating swine slurry, following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Across diverse methodological approaches and regional contexts, the literature consistently shows that AD can reduce global warming potential compared with conventional slurry management, with stronger environmental benefits when biogas is efficiently valorized and when swine slurry is co-digested with complementary organic substrat. Co-AD emerges as a key mitigation option by improving biogas yields, process stability, and overall environmental performance while also enabling better utilization of external organic waste. However, the results remain highly sensitive to operational factors such as methane leakage, digestate management, energy efficiency, and substrate selection. This review highlights the methodological inconsistencies among LCA studies and underscores the need for harmonized assessment frameworks and improved emission data. Overall, co-AD represents a promising pathway for enhancing the environmental sustainability of swine production systems when integrated into optimized, context-specific management strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Student employment is an increasingly common feature of higher education, yet psychological research on students who combine paid work and study remains conceptually and methodologically fragmented. This scoping review mapped the extent, range, and nature of empirical evidence on working students’ psychological experiences, summarized key psychosocial correlates, and identified gaps for future research. Consistent with PRISMA-ScR guidance, we searched EBSCOhost, Scopus, and Web of Science using tailored Boolean title-field strategies without year limits, screened records against eligibility criteria, and charted and thematically synthesized extracted data. Forty-two peer-reviewed English-language studies were included. Evidence clustered into six recurrent domains, such as work–study interface processes, resources and supports, health, stress and recovery, academic engagement and performance, career development and employability, and identity and social relations. The literature was predominantly quantitative and cross-sectional, with comparatively few intervention studies. Findings suggest that psychological outcomes are frequently examined through, and may be more closely contingent on, the quality of the work–study interface and contextual supports than on employment intensity alone, highlighting the potential value of interventions and institutional/employer practices that enhance role fit, flexibility, and supportive climates, alongside more longitudinal and multi-level research.",

    "Abstract": "Self-esteem and attachment are core constructs in adult relational functioning, yet their interrelations across levels of cognitive processing have remained understudied. This study investigated how explicit and implicit attachment styles relate to self-esteem in individuals seeking a romantic partner (N = 399) and in a partnered sample (N = 108). Participants completed explicit attachment and self-esteem scales, along with three single-target Implicit Association Tests (IATs) assessing implicit self-esteem and avoidant and anxious attachment styles. Regression analyses were conducted using explicit and implicit attachment as predictors of explicit and implicit self-esteem while controlling for covariates. In singles, explicit anxious attachment was negatively associated with explicit self-esteem, while implicit anxious attachment and implicit avoidant attachment were negatively associated with implicit self-esteem. No cross-level associations were found, supporting a parallel-level interpretation in which explicit and implicit variables relate primarily within, rather than across, processing levels. The same regression models applied to the partnered sample showed generally similar trends, although the associations observed in singles for explicit anxious and implicit avoidant attachment were not detected in the partnered group. The inclusion of implicit measures provides new insight into non-conscious relational insecurity, with both implicit anxious and avoidant attachment showing negative associations with implicit self-esteem.",

Unlike the path integral Monte Carlo method, our method evolves, in imaginary time, the density matrix from its initial delta function condition to its final thermal form in an amount of time equal to the inverse temperature. It does this with a molecular dynamics scheme applied to a classical Hamiltonian that has the same functional form as the one for the quantum mechanical Hamiltonian according to the properties of the continuous representation of John R. Klauder. We then end up with the thermal density matrix, which can be used to extract thermal averages of observables using the Monte Carlo method equally well in any statistics.",

Herein, we focus on the application of cycloaddition reactions in investigating biological molecules and materials using magnetic resonance techniques. To facilitate magnetic resonance studies such as electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and paramagnetic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, there is often a requirement to attach spin labels and paramagnetic tags to the system of interest. The cycloaddition reaction is one of the ways to tether these spin labels and paramagnetic tags. In this review, we highlight the applications of various cycloaddition reactions such as the Cu(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction, the strain-promoted azide–alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) reaction and the Diels–Alder reaction in the interdisciplinary field of magnetic resonance studies of biomolecules, including proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids and glycans, as well as materials.",

    "Abstract": "The complex fabric of global cultures, shaped by multireligious, multicultural, and multilingual exchanges, encourages cross-cultural involvement and interchange among many groups. This diversity encourages shared appreciation and the pursuit of universal human goals, thereby promoting harmonious interactions. The Indian Christian women religious, specifically, embody such a dynamic, as their vocational duties frequently involve movement and subsequent integration into multiple contexts of culture, fostering cross-border interactions and exchanges. This qualitative research examines the transcultural encounters of Christian women religious from Karnataka, India, who frequently move within the country as well as overseas, in fulfillment of their pastoral responsibilities. Utilizing the transcultural framework, the study employs dialogical narrative analysis approach to identify the voices of Christian women religious situated in the in-depth interviews with six Roman Catholic nuns and Protestant women priests. The findings demonstrate how the Christian women religious actively negotiate their cultural identities, adopt coping mechanisms, and integrate into the society at large. The study reveals the transformational effects of cross-cultural contacts in multicultural, multilingual, and multireligious settings, allowing for a deeper understanding of the intricate intersection between culture, mobility, and identity. It divulges how mobility further contributes to the negotiation of cultural identities and fosters transculturality, highlighting how adaptable and dynamic cultural identities are when relocation occurs.",

    "Abstract": "Lushan 廬山 and Wutaishan 五臺山 have long occupied important positions in East Asian Buddhism as sacred sites. The wuhui nianfo 五会念仏 and Pure Land philosophy initiated by Fazhao 法照 (746–838) on Wutaishan greatly influenced the development of both rituals and the philosophy of Pure Land Buddhism in Japan. In this paper, I examine how Fazhao’s idea of the wuhui nianfo and salvation in Pure Land Buddhism influenced the transformational movement of Japanese Pure Land Buddhism in the 13th century. Hōnen’s 法然 (1133–1212) disciples, Seikaku 聖覚 (1167–1235) and Shinran 親鸞 (1173–1263), among others, wrote works in response to criticisms of Hōnen from Tendai 天台 and Hossō 法相 monks, in which they cited Fazhao’s wuhui nianfo thought to develop arguments in defense of Hōnen’s teachings. I examine how Hōnen, Seikaku, and Shinran were influenced by Fazhao’s Pure Land thought during the Kamakura-era (1185–1333) when the transformational Pure Land movement developed in Japan. Fazhao’s Pure Land thought responded to criticisms against Pure Land Buddhism of his own time. Similarly, Hōnen, Seikaku, and Shinran carried out their role in their own way, guided by Chinese Pure Land masters such as Shandao 善導 (613–681) and Fazhao. Shinran carefully interprets Fazhao’s thought so that it is not misunderstood as insisting on self-indulgence and antinomianism. Shinran intended to make clear that Fazhao’s intention was to reveal the universal working of Amida’s Vow. Furthermore, Shinran developed the ideas of shinjin 信心 and other power 他力 reflecting on it. Fazhao’s passages inspired Shinran’s deep religious awakening about the meaning of Amida’s Vow, shinjin, and other power. Shinran also composed Japanese hymns in the form of Imayō 今様, which were sung with melodies akin to the wuhui nianfo.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the systematic development and philosophical “finalization” of śamatha (止 tranquility) and vipaśyanā (觀 insight) within the foundational texts of the Yogācāra tradition. Central to the transmission of Buddhism to East Asia was the categorization of practice (修行 caryā) through the lenses of concentration (三摩地 samādhi) and wisdom (般若 prajñā). This paper focuses on two pivotal canons: the Śrāvakabhūmi 聲聞地 section of the Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra 瑜伽師地論 and the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra 解深密經. In the Śrāvakabhūmi, Śamatha is presented as a rigorous, self-contained psychological system. The text outlines a cognitive progression from “worldly common paths”—including impurities meditation (不淨觀 aśubhabhāvanā) and the eight liberations (八解脫 aṣṭau vimokṣāḥ)—to the sophisticated “nine stages of mental abiding” (九住心 navākārā citta-sthitiḥ). This research analyzes the psychological mechanisms of these stages, illustrating how they facilitate a metacognitive transition from distraction (散亂 vikṣepa) to absorption (禪那 dhyāna), culminating in the eradication of afflictions (煩惱 kleśa). Furthermore, the paper explores how the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra provides the ultimate philosophical synthesis of these practices. By framing śamatha and vipaśyanā within the Consciousness-Only (唯識 vijñaptimātratā) framework, the sūtra finalizes the meaning of Adhicitta-śikṣā (增上心學 training in higher mind). By bridging the technical rigor of the Śrāvakabhūmi with the Mahāyāna ontological depth of the Saṃdhinirmocana-sūtra, this study clarifies the evolution of buddhist bhāvanā.",

    "Abstract": "Current synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR ATR) tasks face challenges including limited training samples and poor generalization capability to novel classes. To address these issues, few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) has emerged as a promising research direction. Few-shot learning facilitates the expedited adaptation to novel tasks utilizing a limited number of labeled samples, whereas incremental learning concentrates on the continuous refinement of the model as new categories are incorporated without eradicating previously learned knowledge. Although both methodologies present potential resolutions to the challenges of sample scarcity and class evolution in SAR target recognition, they are not without their own set of difficulties. Fine-tuning with emerging classes can perturb the feature distribution of established classes, culminating in catastrophic forgetting, while training exclusively on a handful of new samples can induce bias towards older classes, leading to distribution collapse and overfitting. To surmount these limitations and satisfy practical application requirements, we propose a Few-Shot Class-Incremental SAR Target Recognition method based on a Dynamic Task-Adaptive Classifier (DTAC). This approach underscores task adaptability through a feature extraction module, a task information encoding module, and a classifier generation module. The feature extraction module discerns both target-specific and task-specific characteristics, while the task information encoding module modulates the network parameters of the classifier generation module based on pertinent task information, thereby improving adaptability. Our innovative classifier generation module, honed with task-specific insights, dynamically assembles classifiers tailored to the current task, effectively accommodating a variety of scenarios and novel class samples. Our extensive experiments on SAR datasets demonstrate that our proposed method generally outperforms the baselines in few-shot class incremental SAR target recognition.",

    "Abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for crop monitoring, but their widespread adoption is limited since they often rely on non-standard specialized cameras equipped with near-infrared (NIR) sensors. More affordable and scalable crop monitoring solutions would be enabled, however, if data could be collected using standard RGB sensors. We compared visible-band indices that incorporate blue spectral range (NDGBI and NDRBI) with traditional NIR-based indices (NDVI and GNDVI) for their effectiveness in monitoring maize growth and nitrogen status. UAV multispectral data capture at different maize growth stages was complemented by ground-based spectroradiometer measurements for calibration and validation. Various agronomic and yield variables (including cornstalk NO3–N content, grain yield, grain moisture, number of corncobs, and grain test weight) were recorded to link spectral responses with plant performance and nutritional status. The results show that the overall performance of the RGB-based approach was comparable to that of the NIR-based approach, with the visible-band indices proving to be highly sensitive to physiological stress, chlorophyll degradation, and nitrogen variability in maize. Our findings highlight the potential of the RGB-based indices to complement or even replace specialized NIR-based indices, providing a cost-effective, high-resolution tool for precision agriculture.",

    "Abstract": "In recent years, the methods based on convolutional neural networks have achieved significant progress in hyperspectral image super-resolution. However, existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) they fail to fully extract edge detail information from hyperspectral images; (2) they struggle to simultaneously capture local and global features. To address these issues, we propose an Edge-Distilled and Local–Global Feature Selection network (EDLGFS) for hyperspectral image super-resolution. This network aims to effectively leverage edge details and local–global features, thereby enhancing super-resolution reconstruction quality. Firstly, we design an edge-guided super-resolution network based on knowledge distillation. This network transfers edge knowledge to improve the reconstruction. Secondly, we propose a Local–Global Feature Selection mechanism (LGFS), which integrates convolutions of different sizes with the self-attention mechanism. This design models spatial correlations across features with different receptive fields, achieving efficient feature selection to more effectively capture local and global features. Finally, we propose a dynamic loss mechanism to more effectively balance the contribution of each loss term. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed EDLGFS achieves superior super-resolution reconstruction quality.",

    "Abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning (DL) have enabled the integration of diverse biomedical data for disease prediction and risk stratification. Building on this progress, the overall objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a multimodal DL framework for robust multi-label classification (MLC) of major comorbidities in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) using physiological time series signals and clinical data. This study proposes a robust framework for multi-label classification (MLC) of comorbidities in patients with OSA using diverse physiological and clinical data sources. We conducted a retrospective observational study including a convenience sample of 144 patients referred for overnight polysomnography at the Sleep Medicine Center (SleepLab Split), University Hospital Centre Split (KBC Split), Split, Croatia. Patients were selected based on predefined inclusion criteria and data availability. A one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) was developed to process and fuse time series signals, oxygen saturation (SpO2), derived SpO2 features, and nasal airflow (FP0), with demographic and physiological parameters, enabling the identification of key comorbidities such as arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and asthma/COPD. The instruments included polysomnography-derived signals (SpO2 and FP0 airflow) and structured demographic/physiological parameters. Signals were preprocessed and used as inputs to the proposed fusion model. The proposed model was trained and fine-tuned using the Optuna hyperparameter optimization framework, addressing class imbalance through weighted loss adjustments. Its performance was comprehensively assessed using multi-label evaluation metrics, including macro/micro F1-score, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, subset and partial accuracy, Hamming loss, and multi-label confusion matrix (MLCM). The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine, University of Split (Approval No. 003-08/23-03/0015, Date: 17 October 2023). The 1D-CNN achieved superior predictive performance compared to traditional machine learning (ML) classifiers with macro AUC-ROC = 0.731 and AUC-PR = 0.750. The model demonstrated consistent behavior across age, gender, and BMI groups, indicating strong generalization and minimal demographic bias. In conclusion, the results confirm that SpO2 and airflow signals inherently encode comorbidity-specific physiological patterns, enabling efficient and scalable screening of OSA-related comorbidities without the need for full polysomnography. Although the study is limited by data set size, it provides a methodological basis for the application of multi-label DL models in clinical decision support systems. Future research should focus on the expansion of multi-center datasets, thereby improving model interpretability and potential clinical adoption.",

    "Abstract": "To address the tradeoff between environmental robustness and fine-grained accuracy in single-sensor human behavior recognition, this paper proposes a non-contact system fusing 77 GHz SIFT (mmWave) radar and a 40 kHz ultrasonic array. The system leverages radar’s long-range penetration and low-visibility adaptability, paired with ultrasound’s centimeter-level short-range precision and electromagnetic clutter immunity. A synchronized data acquisition platform ensures multi-modal signal consistency, while wavelet transform (for radar) and STFT (for ultrasound) extract complementary time–frequency features. The proposed Attention-CNN-BiLSTM architecture integrates local spatial feature extraction, bidirectional temporal dependency modeling, and salient cue enhancement. Experimental results on 1600 synchronized sequences (four behaviors: standing, sitting, walking, falling) show a 98.6% mean class accuracy with subject-wise generalization, outperforming single-sensor baselines and traditional deep learning models. As a privacy-preserving, lighting-agnostic solution, it offers promising applications in smart homes, healthcare monitoring, and intelligent surveillance, providing a robust technical foundation for contactless behavior recognition.",

    "Abstract": "The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is commonly used for outdoor positioning. However, its effectiveness diminishes in urban canyons and indoor environments attributed to signal blockage. This study aims to explore the potential of GNSS signals penetrating indoor spaces through windows and to enhance indoor positioning with 3D Mapping-Aided (3DMA) GNSS, a concept generally applied outdoors. The research employs a 3D model of a corridor with manually labeled window locations to predict satellite visibility within indoor areas. The study integrates Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) with an indoor Shadow-matching (I-SM) technique, utilizing an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to improve positioning accuracy. One of the findings indicates that the proposed method significantly enhances positioning performance and its availability, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) that is 2 m better than using PDR alone or single epoch I-SM. The study concludes that integrating GNSS with I-SM technique and PDR can optimize an indoor positioning solution and highlights the potential for improved navigation solutions in complex urban environments.",

    "Abstract": "Pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) produces systemic alterations that can be reflected in biochemical parameters beyond microbiological resolution. Early characterization of the biochemical response to treatment could provide additional criteria for following up with hospitalized patients. A retrospective observational study was conducted focusing on patients with pulmonary TB from a tertiary care hospital, based on biochemical parameters upon admission (“before”) and between 2 and 10 days after starting anti-tuberculosis treatment (“after”). The patients were grouped into three clusters according to the results of the clinical tests: mild (70.1%), inflammatory (26.7%), and severe (3.2%). After the start of treatment, 30% of the patients migrated toward the most biochemically compromised phenotype (Cluster 3). Sixty-one percent showed deterioration in at least one of the three key parameters; only 12.8% improved simultaneously. Significant associations were identified between unfavorable biochemical evolution and HIV (p = 0.004) or patients with public health coverage (p = 0.01). Overall, after antituberculous therapy, a reduction in CRP and leukocytes was observed (p &lt; 0.001), and progressive anemia (ΔHb: −1.7 g/dL) and renal deterioration (ΔCr: +0.52 mg/dL) were identified. The identification of dynamic phenotypes in patients with pulmonary TB can be used to establish early risk markers and contribute to individualized clinical surveillance.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the potential of digital twin (DT) technology to strengthen urban security, with a specific focus on flood risk management in smart cities. A DT is understood as a virtual representation of real-world assets and processes, continuously synchronised with data from the physical environment. Building on an analysis of the existing DT literature and maturity assessment, identified operational requirements and the authors’ expertise in crisis management, this study proposes a structured set of DT maturity levels with stage boundary conditions and illustrative measurable indications and designs a maturity-driven data content model for a flood-oriented DT. The framework identifies essential data layers, sensing requirements and integration mechanisms necessary for representing hydrological, infrastructural and environmental conditions at operationally meaningful update frequencies. This study further outlines the conceptual architecture of a flood DT and discusses its potential to support prediction, situational awareness and decision making across crisis management phases. By providing recommendations for DT implementation and highlighting opportunities for future development, this study contributes to ongoing efforts to enhance the resilience and safety of urban areas through advanced digital technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Honour-based violence can be considered a serious global problem that involves violations of human rights, and having a disability may increase the risk of being subjected to violence. The purpose of this study was to investigate the situation and needs of persons with disabilities who have been subjected to honour-based violence. Interviews were conducted with a sample of seven women and three men aged 20–60 from different minority groups living in Sweden. All had different disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, PTSD, neuropsychiatric disabilities, mental illness, impaired hearing, deafness or deaf blindness. Thematic analysis was used, identifying four themes: A family context in the shadow of violence, Violence in different forms, Conditional belonging and The price of freedom. An intersectional perspective highlights how disability, in combination with gender, age, culture, religion and honour norms, increases vulnerability to control and violence. The common thread was the group’s specific exposedness to various forms of violence. The results point to the importance of recognising the complexity of having a disability in an honour-based context. A broader perspective is necessary to develop both measures to prevent and combat this violence and support for those who have disabilities and live with protected identities.",

    "Abstract": "The Esquel pallasite provides a valuable record of metal–silicate interaction in differentiated planetesimals, yet many aspects of its formation and thermal evolution remain uncertain. Here, we present a comprehensive multi-technique characterization of a single Esquel specimen, integrating SC-XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM–EDS, XPS, magnetic force microscopy, and X-ray computed tomography. Olivine grains are shown to be structurally pristine, with the first full crystallographic refinement for Esquel confirming a single-domain silicate lattice. XPS demonstrates a stoichiometric silicate surface containing only lattice O2−, Si4+, Mg2+, and Fe2+, indicating that olivine remained chemically unaltered. The Fe–Ni metal preserves diffusion-controlled taenite–kamacite exsolution, compositionally distinct plessite, accessory schreibersite and troilite as resolved by SEM. Quantitative Ni zoning, evaluated through interface-to-center gradients and a width–center-Ni correlation method, yields a self-consistent cooling rate of ~10–20 °C/Myr. MFM reveals microscale magnetic structures that correlate directly with Fe–Ni chemical zoning, providing magnetic confirmation of slow cooling. CT analysis further identifies interconnected metal networks, inclusions, and micro-porosity reflecting melt migration and late-stage modification. These results establish Esquel as an exceptionally well-preserved pallasite and demonstrate the value of integrated, multi-scale analytical workflows for reconstructing early Solar System processes.",

    "Abstract": "The study investigated the prevalence of students meeting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) recommendations and factors associated with MVPA during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 4059 university students (2200 females [F]) during the lockdown using an electronic form. PA was assessed using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-SF). Independent variables included sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge to perform PA, pre-pandemic PA, sedentary behavior (SB), and health self-reports related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, 56% of students met MVPA recommendations (males [M]: 57.7%, F: 54.3%; χ2 = 4.703, p = 0.030). Knowledge to perform PA (M: OR = 3.012, 95% CI: 2.413–3.759; F: OR = 2.948, 95% CI: 2.444–3.556) and being physically active before the pandemic (M: OR = 2.651, 95% CI: 2.060–3.412; F: OR = 1.459, 95% CI: 1.079–1.974) increased the likelihood that students attained the MVPA recommendations. In contrast, longer daily exposure to SB was negatively associated with MVPA in both sexes. In this context, the present findings reinforce the relevance of universities as strategic settings for the promotion of PA in middle-income countries, where social and economic vulnerabilities may exacerbate the long-term consequences of physical inactivity.",

    "Abstract": "Ultramarathon runners experience pain during the race. Their mental responses to pain influence race performance. This scoping review synthesises the existing literature on the mental pain responses of ultramarathon runners. The framework of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for scoping reviews (PRISMA-Scr) was followed. We screened four online databases, obtaining 121 non-duplicate publications. We filtered these publications to eventually include seventeen research articles. Results were structured according to four overarching categories: thought processes, psychological traits, pain expectations, and cultural discourses. Ultramarathon runners have both associative and dissociative thoughts in response to pain. They are less harm avoidant and less anxious about pain than the general population. They expect and accept pain. Their mental pain responses are modulated by ultra-running discourses. Conclusions: While mental pain responses of ultramarathon runners have been moderately described in the literature, their effects on race performance remain largely unknown. This represents an exciting opportunity for future research.",

    "Abstract": "A well-developed national park scheme is of great significance in ensuring the sustainability of the ecological environment and addressing the risks of community green development. As a key mechanism for the transformation of ecological product value, the implementation and optimization of the concession system contribute to the coordinated development of national park protection and community interests. How to promote the transition of national park concession from “system establishment” to “system efficiency improvement” is an important issue in system optimization, and the key to solving this issue is to assessing the credibility of national park concession systems in the community. Community residents are important stakeholders in the national park concession system, and their perception of this system’s credibility reflects its levels of rationality, efficiency and sustainability. This study takes residents of four villages in Wuyishan National Park as an example, obtains data through a questionnaire survey, and uses linear regression analysis to study the influencing factors of residents’ credibility of national park concession systems from five aspects, including household location, demographic characteristics, functional perceptions of the concession system, normative perceptions of the concession system, and expectation perceptions of the concession system. The results show that: (1) Residents show different perceptions of the concession system in national parks; they generally believe that it conforms to the collective interests and should be permanent. (2) The normative perceptions and expectation perceptions of the concession system in national parks have a significant positive impact on its credibility. Furthermore, age and educational attainment significantly influence residents’ perceptions of the system’s credibility. The impact of household location on the credibility of national park concession systems is not significant.",

    "Abstract": "Food systems are major drivers of global environmental change, accounting for about one-third of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contributing to land degradation, freshwater depletion, and biodiversity loss. Within this system, post-retail activities generate an estimated 18–20% of total food-related GHG emissions. In Europe, food service is responsible for roughly 12% of total food waste, making collective catering a strategic sector for sustainability interventions. Objective: Through menu design and composition, collective catering services can influence the environmental performance of thousands of meals served daily. This study introduces a novel meal-level scoring system—the App for the Environmental Impact Assessment of Dishes in Collective Catering (EcoRistApp, ERA)—designed to assess and communicate the environmental performance of institutional canteen dishes. Methods: EcoRistApp was developed and applied to a representative selection of first courses, second courses, and side dishes. Environmental impacts were quantified using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with SimaPro 9.5.5 software and the ReCiPe Midpoint (H) method. Normalized and weighted impact results were aggregated into a composite Environmental Impact Index (EII), which was then translated into a five-color interpretative scale to enhance usability and comprehension. Results: The analysis highlighted marked differences in environmental performance among dishes, largely driven by ingredient type and origin. Plant-based meals, such as lentil soup, consistently achieved lower impact scores, while dishes containing animal-derived ingredients, particularly beef and fish, showed higher impacts across multiple categories. Recipes combining high- and low-impact ingredients demonstrated potential for reducing overall environmental burdens. Conclusions: By converting complex LCA outcomes into an intuitive scoring system, EcoRistApp supports informed decision-making by catering operators and consumers, encourages plant-forward menu strategies, and contributes to the environmental transition of food service systems.",

    "Abstract": "The global push for energy decarbonization has increased interest in hydrogen as a clean energy carrier. Biohydrogen from agricultural residues is a promising pathway for countries with strong agro-industrial sectors. This study evaluates the technical, economic, and environmental feasibility of hydrogen production from palm oil rachis in two post-conflict regions of Colombia: a large-scale facility in Bolívar and a small-scale plant in Santander. The assessment integrates Aspen Plus® (version 14) simulations using the NRTL thermodynamic model, an attributional gate-to-gate Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with ReCiPe Midpoint (H), and a techno-economic analysis. The simulated process includes biomass drying, decomposition, steam gasification, syngas cleaning, and methane reforming. A key technical finding was the non-linear relationship between feedstock composition and process yield. Although Santander’s biomass had a higher hydrogen content (9.42% vs. 6.58%), Bolívar achieved a much higher conversion efficiency (0.198 kg H2/kg biomass) and produced over seven times more hydrogen while processing only 5.8 times more biomass. Environmental results showed clear advantages for Bolívar, which presented lower impacts across most categories compared to Santander and the fossil-based hydrogen benchmark. Bolívar achieved a Global Warming Potential of 2.47 kg CO2 eq/kg H2, far below the 15.03 kg CO2 eq/kg H2 of Santander, and showed favorable performance in particulate matter formation, acidification, and fossil resource scarcity. Economically, Bolívar was viable, with a Net Present Value of USD 25.01 million, a Benefit–Cost Ratio of 3.29, and a discounted payback period of 4.54 years. Santander was economically unfeasible under all conditions. Hydrogen production from palm rachis is technically feasible, environmentally beneficial, and economically viable when biomass availability and process integration are adequate, as illustrated by the Bolívar case.",

    "Abstract": "Climate change is a pressing issue that has far-reaching effects on the global ecosystem, societies, and economies. Climate-induced disasters exacerbate multidimensional poverty through economic, social, and environmental pathways. This study examines the relationship between climate-induced disasters and multidimensional poverty, applying a mixed-method design comprising a PRISMA-guided systematic review and thematic analysis. Articles published between 1999 and 2025 were retrieved from Scopus and Web of Science, yielding 3587 articles. After reference checking and screening for relevance and availability, we finally reviewed 17 articles. The results highlight that climate-induced disasters disrupt economic and livelihood activities, negatively impact GDP, slow financial development, reduce per capita expenditure ability, and harm agricultural production. Disasters also have negative impacts on health and well-being, education, gender, the natural environment, and culture; these disasters promote intergenerational poverty. Among all stressors, floods and droughts are the most pervasive, and they have different magnitudes and durations of impacts. The assessment identifies governance quality, gender inequality, education, social positions, and environmental degradation as the significant mediating systems influencing vulnerability and recovery. To cope with vulnerabilities, individuals employ a variety of strategies based on their socioeconomic status. Building on these insights, the study develops the Multidimensional Climate–Poverty Dynamics (MCPD) Framework to conceptually capture climate–poverty as a socially constructed and institutionally mediated process. The study contributes theoretically to environmental sociology and empirically to climate policy by framing adaptation as a social process of transformation rather than as solely a survival mechanism.",

    "Abstract": "Alternative splicing of pre-mRNA is a crucial mechanism in gene expression regulation. As a core component of the spliceosome, the biological function of the Skip protein in Aspergillus flavus remains unknown. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed the presence of two skip gene copies in A. flavus. Single-copy deletion of Skip resulted in slowed growth, reduced conidiation, abolished sclerotial formation, increased aflatoxin biosynthesis, and diminished crop colonization. Meanwhile, Skip was found to regulate the oxidative stress response by modulating the alternative splicing of yapA. Subsequently, immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses identified lysine 325 (K325) as the benzoylated site on the Skip protein, which catalyzed by the acyltransferase EsaA. Mutation of benzoylated site K325 directly impaired fungal morphogenesis, pathogenicity, and stress adaptation. These findings established the crucial role of Skip and its benzoylation in A. flavus and suggested a potential target for controlling its infection in important crops.",

    "Abstract": "Influenza (flu) is a common respiratory virus with seasonal global spread. Zoonotic viruses can occasionally cross species, leading to pandemic-level spread, and for flu viruses, this is considered an “antigenic shift”. The flu can be particularly severe during pregnancy due to immune system adaptations that occur during pregnancy, with prior global pandemics causing excess hospitalizations, deaths, and other complications in the mothers and the neonates. We aim to review the current literature with respect to novel avian H5N1 and the potential impact of infection with flu during pregnancy. A systematic literature search was conducted. Here we provide a rapid summary of epidemiology and understanding of viral spread, published risks of H5N1 in pregnancy, the unique physiologic, cellular, and molecular adaptations making H5N1 infection unique in pregnancy, implementation of an effective vaccine program in event of a pandemic specific to pregnant individuals, optimizing peripartum care for infected individuals, and direction for future research to direct vaccine strategy and mitigate risks in a future flu pandemic.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Miller–Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a rare Guillain–Barré variant defined by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. Pediatric MFS is uncommon, and infectious triggers remain underrecognized. Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is neurotropic but rarely linked to immune-mediated neuropathies. In this paper, we describe a child with MFS associated with HHV-6 detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and review reported pediatric infections related to MFS. Methods: A 5-year-old girl presented with acute ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and diminished reflexes. Neuroimaging, ophthalmologic tests, CSF analyses, and serologic andpolymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were performed, including multiplex reverse transcription–PCR of cerebrospinal fluid using the BioFire® Meningitis/Encephalitis panel. A literature search was performed on Pubmed to identify pediatric (0–18 years) MFS cases with infectious triggers. Two reviewers independently screened and summarized the literature, and a PRISMA-style flow diagram was used to transparently report the study selection process. Results: HHV-6 DNA was detected via CSF PCR twice, while tests for other pathogens were negative. Anti-GQ1b and related antibodies were negative or borderline. The patient received intravenous immunoglobulin and corticosteroids, with full recovery after one month. Among 20 published pediatric cases (1997–2021), Campylobacter jejuni was most frequent, followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae and influenza viruses. Anti-GQ1b IgM positivity and favorable outcomes were commonly reported, including cases managed conservatively. Conclusions: This case raises the hypothesis that HHV-6 may represent a potential post-infectious association in pediatric MFS. The review findings indicate that pediatric MFS generally follows infection, responds well to immunotherapy, and has an excellent prognosis. Viral testing may be considered in selected, hypothesis-generating contexts in atypical or seronegative pediatric MFS presentations.",

    "Abstract": "Background: In 2022, Romania experienced a sharp increase in hepatitis A virus (HAV) infections, with evidence of predominant fecal–oral transmission through sexual contact, raising concern for an outbreak among men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: We conducted a prospective multicenter study between 1 March 2022 and 1 March 2023 in two tertiary hospitals in Bucharest. HAV infection was defined by a compatible clinical presentation, elevated liver enzymes, and positive anti-HAV IgM serology. Clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared by transmission route and HIV status. Results: A total of 191 patients were diagnosed with HAV, including 105 MSM and 86 with foodborne transmission. All were unvaccinated. Most patients were male (82.2%), with a median age of 30 years (IQR 24–38). MSM were significantly younger and reported higher-risk sexual behaviors, including chemsex and multiple or occasional partners (p &lt; 0.0001). Among MSM, 48 (25.1%) were living with HIV, most with preserved immune status and undetectable viral loads. Clinical manifestations were similar across groups, with jaundice being most frequent (89.5%). However, MSM exhibited more severe hepatocellular injury, reflected by higher ASAT and ALAT levels and lower prothrombin concentration, independent of HIV status. MSM were also more likely to have concomitant sexually transmitted infections, including syphilis and mpox (p &lt; 0.001). Disease was predominantly mild, although MSM had longer hospital stays. Conclusions: The 2022 HAV surge in Romania was driven by both sexual and foodborne transmission. Targeted HAV vaccination, along with integrated sexual health services and harm-reduction strategies, is essential to prevent future outbreaks.",

    "Abstract": "Osteopontin (OPN) is a phosphorylated acidic glycoprotein that serves various purposes across various systems. Principally, it aids in adhesion and signaling. It is an important protein related to reproduction, which has been discovered in several species, among which is the dromedary camel, where it has been detected in the endometrium and conceptuses at the time of implantation. The objective of this research is to investigate and examine the expression patterns of OPN mRNA and protein in both endometrial uterine horns with their associated fetal membranes during the first trimester of camel pregnancy. Endometrial and fetal membranes were collected from eight pregnant female camels during the first trimester of pregnancy (Days 70–110 of pregnancy). The temporospatial expression of OPN was studied in endometrial tissues and their conceptuses from the left uterine horn (LUH) and right uterine horn (RUH) using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques. The results showed a gradual increase in OPN mRNA expression with advancing pregnancy in both LUH and RUH of endometrial and fetal membranes tissue. OPN protein was predominantly found in the uterine luminal epithelium (LE) and fetal trophectoderm (Tr), stroma, and uterine glands. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that OPN is consistently present in both the endometrium and fetal membranes throughout the first trimester of pregnancy. This observation advances previous knowledge by confirming OPN expression even during the early first trimester, suggesting its crucial role in supporting embryo attachment, implantation, and placentation processes in the dromedary camel.",

    "Abstract": "The efficiency of power transfer is a critical issue for wireless charging applications in electric vehicles. The misalignment between the transmitter coil and the receiver coil in wireless charging leads to a significant reduction in efficiency. This article investigates improving coil misalignment performance in wireless power transfer for electric vehicles using magnetic flux density analysis. The objective is to study the effect of the automatic alignment transmitter system’s movement on error distance. The automatic alignment transmitter system was integrated with a wireless power transfer system to realign the transmitter coil whenever lateral misalignment occurred between the transmitter and receiver coils. The experiment was performed with a horizontal misalignment of 0.35 m and was repeated three times. The gap between the coils was held constant at 0.15 m. The wireless charging system was designed according to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standard. The experimental results demonstrated that the movement error distance was 0.001 m, with an average error of 0.33%. These findings indicate that the automatic alignment transmitter system achieved an operational effectiveness of 99.67%. The maximum wireless charging efficiencies of 75.78% and 75.59% were recorded for the X-axis and Y-axis adjustments, respectively.",

    "Abstract": "Ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is widely used as a key material in biomedical implants such as artificial joints due to its exceptional wear resistance, high impact strength, and good biocompatibility. However, its inherent bio-inertness, hydrophobicity, risk of osteolysis induced by wear debris, and insufficient mechanical and processing properties severely limit its long-term clinical performance. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in the functional enhancement of UHMWPE via hybrid strategies, including surface modifications (e.g., coatings, chemical grafting, laser processing, plasma treatment) and bulk blending modifications (involving both organic and inorganic composites). These approaches have been shown to significantly improve wear resistance, bioactivity, hydrophilicity, and mechanical properties, while effectively suppressing oxidative degradation and inflammatory responses. The current challenges in modification technologies, such as balancing multiple properties, ensuring long-term biosafety, and achieving clinical translation, are also discussed. Finally, future directions toward multifunctional integration, intelligent responsiveness, and personalized customization of implants are outlined, providing critical insights for the development of next-generation high-performance and long-lasting biomedical materials.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We present new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) imaging of a megahertz peaked-spectrum source that was found using commensal low-frequency data taken with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). The source, J0330–2730, was identified in multiepoch data from the VLA Low-band Ionosphere and Transient Experiment (VLITE). VLITE continuously collects low-frequency data at 340 MHz during regular VLA observations. Our analysis of the VLITE light curve demonstrates that J0330–2730 has significant 340 MHz flux variability at the ∼20% level over a timescale of approximately 1 yr. Our VLBA images reveal a resolved, double-lobed morphology with a projected linear size of 64 pc. We consider plausible mechanisms that could explain the observed 340 MHz variability and the source properties on milliarcsecond scales. We rule out variable Doppler boosting and conclude that refractive interstellar scintillation or variable free–free absorption are the most likely explanations. We argue that the properties of J0330–2730 are consistent with the class of compact symmetric objects and consider the evolutionary stage of the source. The extent of the resolved lobes revealed by the VLBA is significantly smaller than predictions based on the turnover–size relation for a standard synchrotron self-absorbed jet model. We discuss possible explanations for the departure from the turnover–size relation, including jet formation by a transient phenomenon such as a tidal disruption event or a “frustrated jet” impeded by the presence of dense gas or a high-pressure environment. This study highlights the potential of VLITE for the identification of compact and young radio sources.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We propose that a hierarchical shock model—including supernova remnant shocks, galactic wind termination shocks, and accretion shocks around cosmic filaments and galaxy clusters—can naturally explain the cosmic-ray spectrum from ∼1 GeV up to ∼ 200 EeV. While this framework applies to the entire cosmic-ray spectrum, in this work we focus on its implications for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We perform a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation to investigate the power processed at shocks around clusters and filaments. The downstream flux from nearby shocks around the local filament accounts for the softer, lower-energy extragalactic component around the ankle, and the upstream escaping flux from nearby clusters accounts for the transition to a hard spectral component at the highest energies. This interpretation is in agreement with UHECR observations. We suggest that a combination of early Universe galactic outflows, cosmic-ray streaming instabilities, and a small-scale turbulent dynamo can increase magnetic fields enough to attain the required rigidities. Our simulation suggests that the available volume-averaged power density of accretion shocks exceeds the required UHECR luminosity density by 3 orders of magnitude. We show that microgauss magnetic fields at these shocks could explain both the origin of UHECRs and potentially contribute to the diffuse radio synchrotron background below 10 GHz. The shock-accelerated electrons produce a hard radio background without overproducing diffuse inverse Compton emission. These results motivate further observational tests with upcoming facilities to help distinguish accretion shocks from other UHECR sources.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will monitor tens of millions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for a period of 10 yr with an average cadence of 3 days in six broad photometric bands. This unprecedented data set will enable robust characterizations of AGN UV/optical variability across a wide range of AGN physical properties. However, existing tools for modeling AGN light curves are not yet capable of fully leveraging the volume, cadence, and multiband nature of LSST data. We present EzTaoX , a scalable light-curve modeling tool designed to take advantage of LSST’s multiband observations to simultaneously characterize AGN UV/optical stochastic variability and measure interband time delays. EzTaoX achieves a speed increase of ∼10 2 –10 4 × on CPUs over current tools with similar capabilities, while maintaining equal or better accuracy in recovering simulated variability properties. This performance gain enables continuum time-delay measurements for all AGNs discovered by LSST—both in the Wide Fast Deep survey and the Deep Drilling Fields—thereby opening new opportunities to probe AGN accretion-flow geometries. In addition, EzTaoX ’s multiband capability allows for robust characterization of AGN stochastic variability down to hourly timescales, facilitating the identification of accreting low-mass AGNs—such as those residing in dwarf galaxies—through their distinctive variability signatures.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract While the temporal variations of the spectropolarimetric nature of pulsars remain unexplored, this investigation offers significant potential for uncovering key insights into pulsar emission mechanisms, magnetic field geometry, and propagation effects within the magnetosphere. We developed a package for investigating time-varying spectral behavior for full Stokes parameters and demonstrate it on a millisecond pulsar (MSP), J2144−5237, in a binary system (orbital period ∼10 days) using the Parkes Ultra-Wideband Low receiver. In this study we report rotation measure variation with orbital phase. We find that the temporal variations in the spectra of Stokes I , Q , and V are generally correlated throughout the orbit, while Stokes U exhibits intervals of both correlation and anticorrelation with Stokes I , depending on the orbital phase. We also provide a Poincaré sphere representation of the polarization properties of J2144−5237, demonstrating a systematic temporal change of Poincaré sphere location for the main component with orbital phase. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of the time-varying properties of the spectropolarimetric nature of any pulsars or MSPs. Extending this study to probe the spectrotemporal nature of full Stokes data on a larger sample of MSPs or pulsars has the potential to provide vital information on emission mechanisms inside the magnetosphere, interstellar propagation effects, and binary interactions.",

We employ two independent methods to derive the limb shift curve: a spectral-averaging method (Method 1) and a velocity-averaging method (Method 2). By comparing synthetic and observed data, we determine the convective blueshift, which is not accounted for in the CHASE observations. The simulations reproduce the observed trends for both methods at the instrument’s spatial resolution (=1 <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" overflow=\"scroll\"> <mml:mover> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>.</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mtext>″</mml:mtext> </mml:mrow> </mml:mover> </mml:math> 2). However, at resolutions below &lt;1″, Method 2 produces limb-shift curves that depart significantly from both Method 1 results and traditional limb-shift profiles, whereas Method 1 remains in agreement with classical behavior. Further analysis finds that the results from Method 1 comprise two distinct components: a contrast contribution caused by the correlation between velocity and line depth and a Dopplergram contribution caused by density inhomogeneities and corrugation effects.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract A sample of 278 triple systems with outer separations under 300 au and resolved inner pairs is studied, focusing on the mutual alignment between the inner and outer orbits. The degree of alignment increases with (i) decreasing outer separation, (ii) decreasing ratio of outer and inner separations, (iii) decreasing mass of the inner primary component, and (iv) increasing inner mass ratio. There is no dependence on the outer mass ratio. The average mutual inclination is ∼40° for the full sample and ∼10° for 38 triples with primary components less massive than 1 M ⊙ and outer separations below 50 au. Inner eccentricities in aligned triples are smaller compared to misaligned ones. In another sample of 371 hierarchies with known outer orbits and inner eclipsing subsystems, only 22% show mutual alignment within 20°, while the rest are aligned randomly. These findings match qualitatively the current understanding of the formation of hierarchical systems, where the N -body dynamics dominates at large scales, while the accretion and migration shape systems closer than ∼100 au. Fragmentation of isolated cores apparently produces approximately aligned low-mass hierarchies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts z ≥ 9 remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive “heavy seeds” must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA)-QUEST, a new framework built on the MESA code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars—massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes (BHs) at their cores—believed to be the progenitors of direct collapse BH seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated convection regimes and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central BHs to ≥10 3 M ⊙ under favorable conditions, with saturated convection models yielding black-hole-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55 M * —five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and general relativistic radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.",

However, due to its orbital geometry, the object is too close to the Sun near perihelion to be observed from the ground, and space-based measurements are therefore required. Here we characterize the water production rate of 3I/ATLAS using Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/SWAN Ly α observations from 2025 November to December (heliocentric distances 1.4–2.2 au) with 3D Monte Carlo modeling.

Furthermore, it displayed remarkable stability in the activity with no signs of outbursts or rapid depletion of water production.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We present an overview of the Weighing Halos Accurately, Locally, and Efficiently with Supernovae (WHALES) survey, the first to discover and measure Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in and around galaxy superclusters. By building a sample of SNe Ia around these massive environments, we aim to provide new constraints on bulk-flow models while laying the groundwork for improved estimates of supercluster masses. Here, we present data from the first two seasons targeting the Shapley Supercluster (0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.06), which is responsible for a large but unknown fraction of our Local Group’s motion. Until now, no supernovae (SNe) had been analyzed in the direction of Shapley. Through the WHALES survey, we have identified 12 likely SNe Ia in this region using SkyMapper, including eight with spectroscopic confirmation. We present the first light curves of these SNe and combine our observations with data from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. We demonstrate that the low number of discovered SNe Ia per season is consistent with various rate calculations, highlighting the need for future surveys to monitor superclusters over a multiyear time span. Finally, we present simulations of SN Ia observations in the environments of massive galaxy clusters, demonstrating how the inferred peculiar velocities can constrain cluster masses, and highlighting the added complexity within superclusters. We find that a sample of 100 SNe Ia would enable a 25% precision measurement of the total mass of the Shapley Supercluster.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Restricted by event horizon suppression, tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a unique window into otherwise hidden supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the lower end of the mass spectrum, allowing the connection between star formation and SMBH mass to be explored across a broad stellar mass range. We derive stellar masses and specific star formation rates using Prospector fits to UV–mid-infrared broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 42 TDE hosts, together with a high-mass comparison sample, and combine these with SMBH mass estimates from the literature. We first verify our approach by reproducing the established result that quenched galaxies host more massive SMBHs than star-forming systems at fixed stellar mass, a result widely interpreted as evidence for SMBH growth driving the blue-to-red sequence transition. However, examining the TDE sample in isolation reveals a trend reversal at lower masses, uncovering a surprising population of low-mass (10 9.6 ≲ M gal ≲ 10 10.5 M ⊙ ), quenched galaxies hosting SMBHs systematically less massive ( M BH ≲ 10 6.5 M ⊙ ) than those in star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass. After ruling out degeneracies in our SED fits, we conclude that this reflects a physical difference in the quenching mechanism between these TDE hosts and the more massive galaxies. This is unlikely to be driven by active galactic nucleus feedback, and could instead result from environmental processes, which can end star formation and hinder SMBH growth. We also show that the quenched and poststarburst population within the TDE sample is likely underrepresented due to selection biases, suggesting the true fraction could be even higher than observed.",

We explore whether the big dip in the radial distribution of molecular gas in the Milky Way is peculiar and find several other galaxies with similar patterns, all with similar morphological classifications of YClxxGnR, indicating a clearly defined, long bar leading to a grand-design spiral. This category is fairly rare among galaxies in the PHANGS sample, but all galaxies with this classification have some evidence for dips in the radial distribution of CO emission. The lengths of the bars correlate with the extents of the dips. The Milky Way and the other galaxies with dips have similar stellar masses and star formation rates, both lying near the high ends of the distributions for all PHANGS galaxies.",

    "Abstract": "Sepsis‑induced vasoplegia, a life‑threatening complication of sepsis, has become a focal point of research endeavors aimed at determining its complex mechanisms. However, existing investigations predominantly focus on the role of endothelial cells (ECs) in sepsis, inadvertently dismissing the pivotal contribution of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The present review highlights the frequently underappreciated role of VSMCs in sepsis‑induced vasodilation, and provides a comprehensive and systematic elucidation of the associated pathophysiological mechanisms. The current review examines the structural characteristics, localization, phenotypic transitions and heterogeneity of VSMCs, emphasizing their critical role in maintaining vascular homeostasis and regulating blood pressure. Subsequently, the review delves into the multifaceted effects of sepsis on VSMCs. Direct injury to VSMCs in sepsis occurs through pathogens. Additionally, the sepsis‑associated cytokine storm can activate key signaling pathways, such as the NF‑κB and p38 MAPK pathways, leading to a phenotypic shift in VSMCs from a contractile state to a synthetic state, thus enhancing their proliferative and migratory abilities. Concurrently, sepsis disrupts the intricate interaction between ECs and VSMCs, and interferes with calcium homeostasis, ultimately resulting in reduced vascular reactivity and abnormal vascular remodeling. Together, these mechanisms contribute to sepsis‑related vascular dysfunction and multiorgan failure. The in‑depth analysis of these processes in the present review offers novel insights into the pathological mechanisms of sepsis‑induced vasoplegia. The current study also provides a theoretical foundation for the development of clinical intervention strategies targeting VSMCs, with the potential to advance sepsis treatment strategies.",

The lesion first appeared during adolescence and remained asymptomatic and clinically inapparent except upon exposure to cold. Cold stimulation induced a transient, linear, wrinkled, hyperpigmented papular lesion on the left thigh, which resolved spontaneously within seconds after rewarming. Histological examination revealed dermal fibrosis and well-organized lobules of smooth muscle cells, confirming the diagnosis of SMH without requiring immunohistochemical analysis.

Despite the clinical importance of severe hypospadias demonstrated by prolonged hospital stays, repeated surgeries, and substantial costs, the genetic etiology of severe hypospadias remains incompletely understood, particularly in diverse populations. To determine the molecular basis, we performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 30 Chinese patients from southeastern China with confirmed 46,XY karyotypes. Our analysis identified clinically relevant genetic variants, including single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and copy number variations (CNVs), with subsequent phenotypic correlation. Clinically relevant genetic variants were identified in 33.3% (10/30) of cases, including novel SNVs in gonadal regulators (nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 1 [ NR5A1 ] c.1344dupC/c.244+1G&gt;T and SRY-box 3 [ SOX3 ] c.1273G&gt;C), morphogenetic modulators (GLI family zinc finger 3 [ GLI3 ] c.4731delA and aristaless-related homeobox [m ARX ] c.644C&gt;G), and syndromic genes (patched domain containing 1 [ PTCHD1 ] c.667G&gt;A and euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 1 [ EHMT1 ] c.3081C&gt;T). Additionally, recurrent CNVs at 22q12.3 and a novel CNV exon 18 deletion in myelin regulatory factor ( MYRF ) and 18q11.2 were identified.

Coiled-coil domain-containing protein 113 ( CCDC113 ) encodes a coiled-coil domain-containing protein critical for the assembly of cilia and flagella.

The mutations (c.901A&gt;C; p.K301Q and c.404A&gt;C; p.E135A) cosegregated with infertility phenotypes and were associated with defective sperm flagella. Functional analyses demonstrated that these mutations led to less stable CCDC113 protein and severely disrupted axonemal structures in spermatozoa from our three human patients. We generated Ccdc113 knockout mice, which recapitulated the human infertility phenotypes, including abnormal sperm morphology, impaired motility, and defective spermatogenesis. Importantly, one patient achieved successful pregnancy by intracytoplasmic sperm injection, highlighting the translational potential of genetic diagnostics. These findings suggest that CCDC113 is essential for male fertility and contribute to the understanding of the genetic landscape of infertility, offering novel insights into its diagnosis and management.",

    "Abstract": "Kleene Algebra (KA) is a useful tool for proving that two programs are equivalent. Because KA's equational theory is decidable, it integrates well with interactive theorem provers. This raises the question: which equations can we (not) prove using the laws of KA? Moreover, which models of KA are complete, in the sense that they satisfy exactly the provable equations? Kozen (1994) answered these questions by characterizing KA in terms of its language model. Concretely, equivalences provable in KA are exactly those that hold for regular expressions. Pratt (1980) observed that KA is complete w.r.t. relational models, i.e., that its provable equations are those that hold for any relational interpretation. A less known result due to Palka (2005) says that finite models are complete for KA, i.e., that provable equivalences coincide with equations satisfied by all finite KAs. Phrased contrapositively, the latter is a finite model property (FMP): any unprovable equation is falsified by a finite KA. Both results can be argued using Kozen's theorem, but the implication is mutual: given that KA is complete w.r.t. finite (resp. relational) models, Palka's (resp. Pratt's) arguments show that it is complete w.r.t. the language model. We embark on a study of the different complete models of KA, and the connections between them. This yields a novel result subsuming those of Palka and Pratt, namely that KA is complete w.r.t. finite relational models. Next, we put an algebraic spin on Palka's techniques, which yield a new elementary proof of the finite model property, and by extension, of Kozen's and Pratt's theorems. In contrast with earlier approaches, this proof relies not on minimality or bisimilarity of automata, but rather on representing the regular expressions involved in terms of transformation automata.",

    "Abstract": "Cadavers are essential for anatomical education, but limited availability necessitates long-term preservation. While formalin is widely used, it is carcinogenic and alters muscle morphology and joint mobility, reducing anatomical accuracy. The modified Larssen solution (MLS) has shown promise in improving joint flexibility, yet its efficacy remains underexplored. This study aimed to evaluate muscle condition and joint range of motion in rat specimens preserved with 4% formalin followed by MLS immersion, compared to continuous 4% formalin preservation. Eighteen rat cadavers were allocated into three groups: intracardiac perfusion followed by 0.9% NaCl immersion, intracardiac perfusion and threemonth immersion in 4% formalin, and intracardiac perfusion with 4% formalin followed by three-month immersion in MLS. Statistical analysis included the <i>t</i>-test or Mann-Whitney test, depending on data distribution. Pearson correlation was used to assess the relationship between muscle fiber fragmentation and joint range of motion. Data from the NaCl group were excluded due to sample decomposition. The MLS group showed significantly redder muscle color (<i>P</i><0.05), softer muscle consistency (<i>P</i><0.05), and a non-significant increase in joint range of motion (<i>P</i>>0.05), without observable muscle fiber fragmentation. Correlation analysis could not be conducted due to the absence of fragmentation. MLS may serve as an effective alternative preservative by maintaining muscle color, texture, and structural integrity. Although the increase in joint mobility was not statistically significant, it was more pronounced than in the 4% formalin group. Future studies should explore longer observation periods and potential correlations with histological findings.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. This study investigated the association between growth hormone (GH) gene polymorphism and postnatal growth and placental traits of Tuj sheep over a 3-year period (2020–2022) at the Atatürk University Sheep Research Farm, Erzurum. The genotype–phenotype association analyses comprised Tuj ewes and their progeny. The polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method using the Hae-III restriction enzyme was applied to identify GH gene variants. Three genotypes were detected: LL (49.0 %), LV (39.0 %), and VV (11.0 %). The mean birth weights were 4.45 kg (LL), 4.52 kg (LV), and 4.36 kg (VV); the weaning weights were 14.80, 15.55, and 14.43 kg, respectively; and the average daily gains were 0.213, 0.226, and 0.209 kg d−1, respectively. Although the GH genotype had no significant association with birth weight (p&gt;0.05), it was significantly associated with weaning weight (p&lt;0.05) and daily live weight gain (p&lt;0.01). The present study involves an analysis of the placental traits (placental area, placental weight, and placental efficiency). The results indicated that there were no statistically significant relationships between the GH genotype and placental traits (p&gt;0.05). The study revealed a significant effect of parity on placental area (p&lt;0.05). Twin lambs demonstrated a higher placental weight than single lambs (p&lt;0.05). No significant differences were identified between lamb sex and placental traits. The LV genotype in Tuj ewes was found to be associated with slightly higher growth performance and had favorable indicators for placental traits in comparison with the LL and VV genotypes. These findings suggest that GH gene polymorphism could serve as a potential genetic marker for improving growth performance in Tuj sheep populations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Ground-level ozone (O3) pollution has recently become of increasing concern in China. Studies have shown that conventional models often fail to predict accurately the net O3 production rate (P(O3)net) due to the absence of certain mechanisms, particularly the kinetics from missing reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) species, and hence affects the reliability of evaluation for O3 formation sensitivity (OFS). Therefore, we conducted a field observation of P(O3)net and OFS using a P(O3)net (NPOPR) detection system based on a dual-channel reaction chamber technique at the Guangdong Atmospheric Supersite of China in Heshan, Pearl River Delta (PRD) in autumn of 2023. The in-situ monitoring data were then compared with results from a zero-dimensional model incorporating the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM v3.3.1). We tested the model performance by incorporating parameterization for 4 processes including HO2 uptake by ambient aerosols, dry deposition, N2O5 uptake, and ClNO2 photolysis, and found that the discrepancies between the modelled P(O3)net (P(O3)net_Mod) and measured data (P(O3)net_Mea) did not change evidently, the maximum daily P(O3)net differed by ∼ 44.8 %. Meanwhile, we found that the agreement of OFS assessment results between the direct measurements and the modelling study was lower in the P(O3)net rising phase (08:00–09:00 LT, 63.6 %) than in the P(O3)net stable phase (10:00–12:00 LT, 72.7 %) and P(O3)net declining phase (13:00–17:00 LT, 72.7 %). The results in this study reflected that unmeasured oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were the most effective compensating factor for the discrepancies between observed and computed P(O3)net and OFS, hinting clearly at the importance of quantitative understanding the total reactivity of VOCs in O3 chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Atmospheric aerosols significantly contribute to air pollution and influence atmospheric chemistry, impacting air quality and public health. Decrease in aerosols can hinder the radical uptake sink of HO2, and thus increase NOx and OH, and subsequently increase ozone levels. This study investigates the seasonal variations of PM10 and aerosol surface area and their effect on surface ozone levels in India, using the GEOS-Chem Chemical Transport Model for the years 2018 and 2022, two years with high and low simulated PM10 concentrations, respectively. The results reveal substantial seasonal variations in PM10 and aerosol surface area. In winter (DJF), higher PM10 and aerosol surface area in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and western Central India (CI) result from biomass burning and industrial activity, while coastal regions show lower aerosol surface area. A decrease in aerosol surface area is seen during the pre-monsoon (March–April–May; MAM) and monsoon (June–July–August–Septmember; JJAS), followed by an increase in the post-monsoon (ON) season. As a result, aerosol-induced HO2 uptake during winter and post-monsoon suppress surface ozone by approximately 5–10 µg m−3 in 2022 when compared to that of 2018. In contrast, during monsoon in 2022, the decrease in aerosol surface area caused an ozone increase of 5–7.5 µg m−3 when compared to that of 2018. On average, this increase in surface ozone due to the decrease in aerosols can be mitigated by reducing anthropogenic NOx emissions by about 25 %–50 %. Thus, we recommend integrated strategies addressing aerosols, precursor emissions and regional meteorology to combat ozone pollution.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. MAMAP2D-Light is an airborne passive remote sensing imaging push-broom spectrometer developed at the Institute for Environmental Physics at the University of Bremen to determine atmospheric methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) column anomalies in the 1.6 µm-band to quantify point-source emissions. In its initial version, as flown in 2022 in Canada, a significant stray light level of 5.6 % of the measured signal has been observed post-campaign, causing apparent error patterns in the retrieved CO2 and CH4 column anomalies. Measurement data collected during an airborne campaign in 2022 in Canada offer the unique opportunity to investigate the end-to-end impact of stray light and its correction on the retrieved CO2 and CH4 column anomalies, as well as the derived emission rates. We successfully developed and applied a stray light correction to the instrument and investigated its impact on the CH4/CO2 proxy method, the CH4 column, and derived point-source emissions. In nearly all cases, applying the CH4/CO2 proxy method reduced the stray-light-related column errors below the CH4 column noise. The derived emission rates for the proxy-retrieval with and without stray light corrected spectra are comparable, proving the ability of the CH4/CO2 proxy method to correct stray-light-related artifacts. In this paper, we additionally investigate the impact on the CH4 total column retrieval for a high contrast scene condition under which the correction by applying the proxy method is no longer sufficient. Following the initial campaign in 2022, the post-campaign stray light characterization and analysis revealed that a significant fraction of stray light was attributed to reflective surfaces in the object plane of the spectrometer. Based on these findings, the total stray light was reduced by ∼ 63 % by implementing a hardware modification from 2023 onward.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Benthic foraminiferal assemblages are key indicators for reconstructing past environmental conditions due to their ecological preference and preservation potential. This study investigates the hard-shelled benthic foraminifera of Edisto Inlet; an Antarctic fjord located on the Northern Victoria Land Coast (Ross Sea). The Inlet is characterized by a well-preserved Holocene laminated sedimentary sequence, providing an invaluable tool to reconstruct local and regional environmental changes. Living and fossil assemblages from the upper 5 cm of sediment were analysed across five sites along an inner-to-outer fjord transect to assess their ecological preferences and preservation patterns. Sites located on the inner fjord are characterized by high accumulation rates, low dry densities, fine grain sizes, and elevated content of organic carbon, indicative of high phytodetrital input and anoxic, reducing conditions probably derived by the burial of fresh organic matter. The surface sediments at these sites host low-diversity low-densities living assemblages but are abundant in dead specimens, suggesting substantial mortality events probably linked to post-sea-ice breakup, high organic matter flux to the bottom, and oxygen depletion associated with low current activity. Total assemblages are characterised by calcareous (Globocassidulina biora, G. subglobosa) and agglutinated (Paratrochammina bartrami, Portatrochammina antarctica) taxa, reflecting sluggish circulation along with a high input of fresh organic matter. A sharp decline in calcareous forms points to intense carbonate dissolution caused by the low redox potential within the sediment that develops during the year. In contrast, transitional and outer sites show more diverse and better-preserved assemblages, including Trifarina angulosa, Nodulina dentaliniformis, Reophax scorpiurus and Globocassidulina spp. among others, consistent with stronger bottom currents and more oxygenated conditions of the outer bay in respect to the inner fjord sites. The site located at the fjord mouth reveals distinct fossil faunas, likely shaped by ecological succession and/or dissolution, highlighting the high environmental variability of this setting. Resistant agglutinated species (Pseudobolivina antarctica, Paratrochammina bipolaris, Miliammina arenacea) dominate these areas, underscoring their potential value for paleoenvironmental reconstruction. Comparison with the succession of the palaeocommunity collected in a nearby marine sediment core (TR17-08) suggests recent improvements in bottom conditions and organic matter content, though key taxa have not recovered to Late Holocene (3600–1500 years BP) levels. These findings highlight the sensitivity of benthic foraminiferal communities to sea-ice dynamics, organic matter input, and hydrographic conditions in Antarctic fjord systems.",

However, the effectiveness of DRM measures remains insufficiently understood, which hinders effective and target-oriented decision-making in GLOF DRM. Existing research predominantly focuses on hazard aspects, with few scientific studies modelling the impacts of DRM measures comprehensively. In order to fill this gap, this study assesses the effectiveness of three different DRM measures for GLOFs in the Ala-Archa catchment, Kyrgyz Republic. Using numerical modelling, we map and assess the effect of three DRM measures: lake lowering, a deflection dam, and a retention basin and compare it to the current baseline hazard map. We develop a hazard reduction score for comparison of the measures and evaluate their effectiveness based on cost and benefit considerations. This study proposes a conceptual framework and methodology that can guide the management of GLOF and debris flow risks in similar contexts globally.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Understanding the distribution and geometry of subsurface faults is critical for predicting fault penetration and associated leakage of fluids such as groundwater, hydrocarbons, and injected anthropogenic waste through sealing intervals. Fault dimensions are often underestimated due to the resolution limits of seismic reflection data, which only image portions of faults with sufficient displacement to offset seismic reflectors. To address this fault underestimation problem, we quantify relationships between host rock composition and fault displacement gradients using a well-exposed outcrop of normal faults in mechanically layered sedimentary rocks in the footwall to the west branch of the Moab Fault, Utah. We integrate high-resolution digital photogrammetry, structural mapping, X-ray diffraction (XRD) mineralogy, and Schmidt rebound measurements to analyze how mineralogy and mechanical properties influence fault displacement vs. height relationships. Our results indicate that normal fault displacement gradients tend to be higher in less competent beds and lower in more competent strata, and that fault displacement gradient is positively correlated with clay content and negatively correlated with strong minerals (e.g., quartz, feldspar, dolomite). Outcrop-derived relationships are used to build a predictive framework that uses fault displacement and mineralogy to predict fault height. We apply this framework to a worked seismic interpretation example and demonstrate that fault dimensions are likely substantially underestimated in conservative seismic interpretations. Our results highlight the importance of mechanical stratigraphy in controlling fault geometry and provide a data-driven approach for estimating sub-seismic fault dimensions, with implications for reservoir characterization, fluid containment, and geohazard assessment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. To improve our understanding of firn compaction and deformation processes, constant-load compressive creep tests were performed on specimens from a Summit, Greenland (72°35′ N, 38°25′ W) firn core that was extracted in June 2017. Cylindrical specimens were tested at temperatures of −5, −18 and −30 °C from depths of 20, 40 and 60 m at stresses of 0.21, 0.32 and 0.43 MPa, respectively. The microstructures were characterized before and after creep using both X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and thin sections viewed between optical crossed polarizers. The results of these experiments comprise a novel data set on the creep of firn at three depths of a firn column at three different temperatures, providing useful calibration data for firn model development. Examining the resulting strain vs. time and strain vs. strain rate curves from the creep tests revealed the following notable features. First, the time exponent k was found to be 0.34–0.69 during transient creep, which is greater than the 0.33 usually observed in fully-dense ice. Second, the strain rate minimum (SRmin) in secondary creep occurred at a greater strain from specimens with lower density and at higher temperatures. Third, tertiary creep occurred more easily for the lower-density specimens at greater effective stresses and higher temperatures, where strain softening is primarily due to recrystallization. Fourth, the SRmin is a function of the temperature for a given firn density. Lastly, we developed empirical equations for inferring the SRmin, as it is difficult to measure during creep at low temperatures. The creep behaviors of polar firn, being essentially different from full-density ice, imply that firn densification is an indispensable process within the snow-to-ice transition, particularly firn deformation at different temperatures connected to a changing climate.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. We present a digital shadow Kalman filtering framework based on the direct linearization of a trusted multibody aeroservoelastic wind turbine model. In contrast to shadowing based on ad hoc modeling approaches, reusing validated industrial or research-grade models reduces the development effort, leverages resources invested in tuning and validation, and, eventually, increases confidence in the results. Building on earlier work, the filter-internal model is extended to improve applicability under non-symmetric, waked, and yaw-misaligned inflow conditions. In addition to tower fore–aft and rotor-speed dynamics, the model incorporates tower side–side motion as well as blade flapwise and edgewise degrees of freedom. Real-time inflow observers estimate rotor-equivalent wind speed, vertical and horizontal shear, and yaw misalignment, enabling operating-point-dependent scheduling of the linearized model. To further enhance predictive accuracy, the white-box model is augmented with data-driven corrections, considering both a bias-correction approach that acts on states and outputs, and a neural-network-based output correction. The proposed method is validated in simulation under freestream, waked, and wake-steering scenarios and subsequently on field data from an instrumented wind turbine. Additional field cases with extreme shear and waked operation are used to assess robustness. Even without data-driven correction, damage-equivalent loads estimated from field data exhibit accuracy comparable to simulation-based results. When correction strategies are applied, accuracy improves substantially, with damage-equivalent load errors reduced to only a few percent.",

    "Abstract": "This study employs three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) to investigate the coupled thermo-mechanical behavior and electrical energy characteristics of Through-Oxide Thermal Via (TOTV) structures under thermal cycling conditions, with an emphasis on quantifying trade-offs between mechanical reliability and electrical efficiency. A unified three-dimensional thermo-mechanical and electrical modeling framework is established to capture stress concentration, deformation behavior, and geometry-dependent parasitic effects in a physically consistent manner, with observed trends showing qualitative agreement with prior TOTV-related studies. Single-objective optimization results indicate that geometric refinement can reduce the maximum principal stress from 119.54 MPa to 97.64 MPa, corresponding to an 18.3% relative improvement within the adopted modeling assumptions. However, such mechanically optimized configurations are accompanied by increased parasitic capacitance, leading to higher dynamic energy consumption. This observation quantitatively highlights the inherent conflict between structural integrity and electrical energy efficiency in dense TOTV arrays. To systematically explore this trade-off, a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) is employed to construct a Pareto-optimal design set. A representative compromise solution—characterized by a via radius of 21.246 µm, pitch of 69.172 µm, and copper thickness of 1.011 µm—achieves a 14.8% reduction in maximum principal stress and a 72% reduction in axial deformation (0.0156 µm), while avoiding the severe energy penalties observed in reliability-only optimizations. Rather than emphasizing absolute performance prediction, the proposed framework serves as an energy-aware design-space exploration methodology, providing quantitative insight into the relative severity of mechanical–electrical trade-offs for future high-density 3D integrated circuits and silicon photonics applications.",

    "Abstract": "Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, characterized by complex pathological processes including ionic imbalance, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis. Carvacrol, a naturally occurring monoterpenoid phenol, has gained attention in drug development for its potent antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7)-inhibitory properties. This review summarizes current evidence regarding the neuroprotective effects of carvacrol in various in vitro and in vivo models of cerebral ischemia and hypoxia. Mechanistic insights reveal that carvacrol modulates multiple molecular pathways, mitigates oxidative damage, suppresses neuroinflammation, alleviates neuronal apoptosis, and inhibits TRPM7 channel activity in cerebral ischemia and hypoxia. Finally, the broader applications of carvacrol in various diseases and its translational prospects are discussed, emphasizing the need for further preclinical and clinical studies to facilitate its development into a novel neuroprotective agent and adjunctive drug for stroke therapy.",

Area of study: The research was conducted and validated at Salahaddin University-Erbil’s Quail Research Hall, Grdarasha Station, Department of Animal production and health, and College of Agricultural Engineering Sciences. Material and methods: A total of 540 quail chicks from three local lines (Desert, Brown, and White) were studied to evaluate growth patterns using four non-linear models (Gompertz-Laird, Logistic, Richards, and Von Bertalanffy). Model comparisons were based on coefficient of determination (R²), adjusted coefficient of determination (R²adj), akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to determine the best fit. Growth parameters, including asymptotic weight (β0), maturity index (β0), inflection point weight (IPW), and inflection point time (IPT), were estimated. Main results: Both genetic line and sex significantly influenced growth parameters, with Desert quails showing superior growth performance and higher body weights than Brown and White lines. The Gompertz model provided the best fit, based on higher R² and R²adj values and lower AIC and BIC values. Desert quails had the highest asymptotic weights (β0), while White quails exhibited the highest maturity index (β0), suggesting faster growth rates, and Desert quails had higher IPW and IPT values, with females maturing later than males. Research highlights: The findings give beneficial insights for improving quail breeding programs that can enhance their growth efficiency and meat yield.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: The scientific advance in cryobiology allows the cryostorage of human semen without the use of toxic permeable cryoprotectants. To do this, the cellular suspensions are supplemented with non-permeable cryoprotective agents that possess mild cytotoxicity. Alternatively, the freezing is executed in vitrification solutions and preservation extenders, with preliminary selected spermatozoa via density-gradient centrifugation and swim-up techniques, although these procedures sometimes cause sperm DNA fragmentation. OBJECTIVE: To introduce unique results concerning the cryopreservation of larger volumes native human semen (above 20‐30 μL) on water-repellent soot-coated surfaces, eliminating the involvement of any freezing extenders and formulations. RESULTS: The natural biomolecular matrix of seminal plasma combined with the icephobicity of rapeseed oil soot promoted the survival of over 5,500,000 forward-moving spermatozoa in 1 mL liquefied ejaculate. CONCLUSION: The future improvement of this technology may facilitate the assisted human reproduction, helping to solve the demographic problem in Europe.",

Cryopreservation of testis tissue may offer fertility restoration for pre-pubertal male cancer survivors. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of PHD-inhibitor GSK360A on the function of testis graft following cryopreservation. Besides, the underlying mechanism is explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wister rats were randomly divided into three groups: fresh control group (neither freezing nor autograft), vehicle group (freezing + autograft + vehicle), and GSK360A group (freezing + autograft + GSK360A). The rate of apoptotic Leydig cells and expression of RIPK1 and caspase-8 were assessed on day 7 post-transplantation. At the 30 th day post-transplantation, the number of spermatogonia, as well as microvessel density of graft were measured. RESULTS: GSK360A statistically increased the number of spermatogonia per round tubule, redued the rate of apoptotic Leydig cells, and enhanced the microvessel density of the graft. Furthermore, diminished protein expression of RIPK1 and enhanced caspase-8 expression were found in the GSK360A group than in vehicle group. CONCLUSION: GSK360A exhibits protective effects on testicular frozen graft by increasing the number of spermatogonia and reducing the rate of apoptotic Leydig cells. Its mechanism may be related to attenuating ischaemic injury and switching cellular death mode from necroptosis to apoptosis in testis grafts.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vitrification freezing has been shown to reduce mammalian oocyte developmental competence, and this has been strongly associated with abnormal mRNA expression in oocytes thawed by vitrification freezing. However the effect of vitrification freezing on the transcriptional machinery of oocytes examined by RNA sequencing has rarely been reported. OBJECTIVE: To study differentially expressed genes in mouse oocytes as a result of vitrification freezing. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: Differential gene expression was determined using DEseq2 (p-value &lt;0.05, minimum multiplicity set at 1.5), and the transcriptomes of mouse stage MII oocytes from the Fresh and Vitrification groups were analyzed by employing the Smart-seq technique. The differentially expressed mRNAs were retrieved according to the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG databases, and finally, a real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to characterize the reliability of the transcriptome data. RESULTS: Among them, 545 genes were detected to be up-regulated and 274 genes were up-regulated. Ten genes related to oxidative phosphorylation were screened to be downregulated, and 44 genes were down-regulated with genes related to the HIF-signaling pathway, ribosomes and apoptosis.GO enrichment analysis showed that these genes were mainly concentrated in the cytoplasm, organelle membranes, mitochondrial membranes, and the Golgi apparatus. The four randomly selected candidate genes’ mRNA expression levels were consistent with the results of RNAseq. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that vitrification freezing affects mouse M II stage oocytes mainly through down-regulation of transcription, which leads to a decrease in the developmental capacity of vitrified oocytes. Our findings will help to identify ways to improve the vitrification efficiency of oocytes.",

    "Abstract": "This study focuses on solving the Allen-Cahn (AC) equation with consideration of varying phase boundary thickness using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN). Traditional numerical methods often exhibit declining computational efficiency and accuracy as problem complexity increases when handling complex phase boundary conditions; PINNs offer a novel approach to addressing such challenges. The study first conducts a detailed derivation of the AC equation and constructs a PINN-based solution model, including three key steps: designing a specific neural network architecture; building a loss function composed of partial differential equation (PDE) residual terms, boundary condition residual terms, and initial condition residual terms; and performing model training. The computational results demonstrate that the established PINN model can effectively solve the AC equation with varying phase boundary thicknesses, accurately revealing the distribution patterns of the order parameter under different phase boundary thicknesses, and adapt to the challenges brought by changes in phase boundary thickness by adjusting the number of iterations to achieve stable and efficient numerical solutions. The phase boundary thickness parameter has a significant impact on order parameter distribution, computational stability, and convergence. Additionally, a discussion is conducted between PINN and the finite difference method. This research provides support for in-depth understanding of the physical connotation of the AC equation and optimization of numerical calculation methods, and also lays a foundation for the application of PINN in solving similar complex problems in fields such as materials science and condensed matter physics. Future work can further expand the application of PINN in high-dimensional phase-field models and multi-physics coupling problems, combine other technologies to improve the accuracy and efficiency of phase-field simulations, and carry out more studies on practical application cases. 本研究聚焦于物理信息神经网络（PINN）求解不同相界厚度变化的Allen-Cahn（AC）方程。传统数值方法在处理复杂相边界条件时，其计算效率与精确度常随问题复杂度而下降；PINN为解决此类问题提供了新途径。本研究首先详细推导了AC方程，进而构建了基于PINN的求解模型，包括设计特定的神经网络架构、构建由偏微分方程残差项、边界条件残差项和初始条件残差项所组成的损失函数，并进行模型训练。计算结果表明，所建立的PINN模型能有效求解不同相界厚度变化的AC方程，准确揭示序参数在不同相界厚度下的分布规律，且能通过改变迭代次数适应相界厚度变化带来的挑战，实现稳定高效的数值求解。此外，将PINN计算结果与有限差分法进行了对比。本研究为深入理解AC方程物理内涵、优化数值计算方法提供支持，也为PINN在材料科学、凝聚态物理等领域解决类似复杂问题奠定基础。未来可进一步拓展PINN在高维相场模型、多物理场耦合问题中的应用，结合其他技术提高相场模拟精确度和效率，并开展更多实际应用案例研究。",

    "Abstract": "Venous adventitial cystic disease (VACD) is a rare vascular disorder characterized by mucin-filled cysts in the venous adventitia. We encountered five patients who presented to our vascular clinic with an initial diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but were later diagnosed with VACD on imaging. The patients were aged 64-81 years; lesion locations included the common femoral vein (n=3), external iliac vein (n=1), and popliteal vein (n=1). Four patients underwent surgical intervention, and one patient received conservative management with medical therapy. All surgically treated patients demonstrated improvement in leg swelling after complete cyst excision. One of the two patients with concomitant thrombus developed a massive pulmonary embolism with hemodynamic instability following catheter-directed mechanical thrombectomy. VACD can mimic DVT; however, computed tomography together with duplex ultrasonography is usually sufficient for differentiation. Thrombosis may occur secondary to outflow obstruction, and complete cyst excision remains the treatment of choice.",

    "Abstract": "Circle material is a fundamental topic in geometry that often causes misconceptions in high school students due to the difference between scientific knowledge and knowledge taught in school. This study aims to analyze the external didactic transposition of circle material by comparing the conceptual structure of scientific knowledge (scholarly knowledge) to the knowledge to be taught in high school mathematics textbooks. This study uses a qualitative descriptive approach with a document analysis method, comparing university-level geometry textbooks as a representation of scholarly knowledge with high school mathematics textbooks as a representation of knowledge to be taught. The results of the study show that external didactic transposition occurs in almost all circle concepts, characterized by simplification of language, adjustment of abstraction levels, reduction of concept classification, and addition of pedagogical and visualization contexts. The simplification and addition of pedagogical context can affect students’ conceptual understanding, especially in the relationships among elements of circles, such as arcs, central angles, circumferential angles, and tangents. These findings open up further research opportunities into internal didactic transposition and other mathematics topics and can serve as a reference for teachers and book developers to improve the quality of coherent, conceptual mathematics learning.",

    "Abstract": "Building on a previous study of Swedish middle-school students’ perspectives on historical significance (Sjölund Åhsberg, 2024b), where students expressed a strong moral engagement with the past, this article further explores and defines two tentative criteria: ethical and affective significance. Using thematic analysis of focus-group interviews and relating the findings to historical empathy (Karn, 2023), the study shows that ethical significance involves making moral judgments about history that students care about and wish to change, while affective significance reflects more intuitive emotional responses. The results indicate that students are highly interested in ethically significant history and its implications for the present and future, yet experience the history classroom as largely silent on these issues. Students also express feelings of guilt and responsibility in relation to ethically challenging histories and a desire to engage with these topics in greater depth. The findings point to didactical opportunities for a more inclusive and engaging history education and highlight guilt as an underexplored dimension of historical significance.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives To synthesize evidence on neurobiological mechanisms, clinical outcomes, and policy interventions related to occupational and socioeconomic stress as primary health determinants. Methods A narrative review was conducted synthesizing evidence from PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases (1990-2024) focusing on meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Search terms included allostatic load, occupational stress, job strain, work-related disease, cardiovascular outcomes, and mental health. Meta-analytic evidence was prioritized for robust effect estimates. Results Allostatic load demonstrates dose-dependent associations with health outcomes. Meta-analyses of &gt;600,000 participants show job strain is associated with 23% increased coronary heart disease risk. Long working hours (≥55 hours/week) are linked to 33% increased stroke risk and 13% increased coronary heart disease risk. Chronic stress correlates with hippocampal atrophy, impaired prefrontal function, elevated inflammatory markers, and 2.5-fold increased depression risk. Work-related stress is associated with over $300 billion annually in U.S. healthcare costs and lost productivity. Conclusions Occupational and socioeconomic stressors demonstrate robust associations with adverse health outcomes through well-characterized neurobiological pathways. Effect sizes rival traditional risk factors. Evidence-based interventions from international comparisons suggest potential effectiveness of structural workplace modifications.",

    "Abstract": "Early detection and accurate identification of melanoma, the most lethal form of skin cancer, are critical for improving patient survival rates. However, conventional diagnostic tools often fail to detect early-stage melanoma due to limited sensitivity. This research introduces an advanced Vision Transformer (ViT)-based model equipped with explainability features, specifically designed to address the complex challenge of early-stage melanoma detection. Self-attention-based Melanoma Analysis using Reliable Transformers with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (SMART-XAI) combines ViT with self-attention methods and explainable AI techniques like Attention Rollout and Self-Attention Attribution to create a melanoma diagnostic system. The ViT architecture leverages multi-scale feature extraction and self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global patterns within skin lesion images. By segmenting images into patches, the model effectively identifies critical melanoma features across various scales, enhancing classification accuracy and interpretability. To ensure clinical transparency, the model incorporates explainable artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, namely Attention Rollout and Self-Attention Attribution, which enable the visualization of image regions that influence the modelís decisions. This interpretability allows clinicians to understand the diagnostic rationale behind AI, thereby fostering greater trust and usability in clinical settings. Experimental validation demonstrated strong performance, achieving 96.0 ± 0.87% accuracy, 95.2 ± 0.75% sensitivity, and 94.1 ± 1.05% specificity across 5-fold cross-validation. These results confirm the system’s reliability as an early detection tool for melanoma, while providing interpretable insights for informed clinical decision-making. Overall, the integration of deep learning with explainable AI represents a significant advancement in dermatological diagnostics, particularly for the management of early-stage melanoma.",

    "Abstract": "The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has driven significant advancements in fields such as agriculture, manufacturing, industry, and transportation. However, the highly interconnected and resource-constrained nature of IoT ecosystems makes them particularly vulnerable to cyberattacks. Although AI-based intrusion detection systems provide an effective protection, their deployment on IoT devices is hindered due to limited memory, processing power, and storage capacity. One strategy for addressing these limitations is dimensionality reduction, consisting of the removal of redundant or irrelevant features in order to reduce computational demands without compromising model accuracy. This work analyses the effectiveness of various dimensionality reduction approaches for the development of efficient and lightweight Random Forest models for anomaly detection in IoT environments. Among the considered methods, Permutation Feature Importance consistently produced the most balanced models, reducing inference time, model size, and RAM usage, while slightly enhancing predictive performance. Furthermore, the feasibility of model deployment in real-world environments was assessed through experiments on a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi device.",

    "Abstract": "Mobile banking in Saudi Arabia has experienced rapid growth driven by the government’s digital transformation efforts under Saudi Vision 2030, which has prompted the adoption of innovative technologies to improve service delivery across digital financial transformation. Analyzing user reviews is instrumental in gauging the success of mobile banking applications (apps). Utilizing sentiment analysis allows banking providers to convert customer feedback into actionable insights, which can help improve their services, attract new customers, and retain current customers. In this study, we conducted a comparative sentiment analysis of mobile banking apps in Saudi Arabia across iOS and Android platforms. We systematically analyzed 15,459 iOS and 230,734 Android user reviews in multiple languages from 10 leading Saudi banks. Utilizing a pre-trained sentiment model, we classified user sentiments into three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. To deepen the evaluation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with GPT-4o was applied to extract fine-grained user concerns, which were visualized through heatmaps of the most frequent usability issues. Our findings revealed clear differences in user satisfaction across mobile banking apps on iOS and Android. On Android, Alrajhi showed the strongest positive sentiment. Both Banque Saudi Fransi and Saudi Investment Bank received consistently negative reviews on iOS and Android. Arab National Bank received strong positive sentiment on iOS but weak positive sentiment on Android. The comparison between 2022 and 2023 showed mixed outcomes: Saudi National Bank improved on Android and Saudi Awwal Bank on iOS, but Alinma on iOS and Arab National Bank on Android worsened. Beyond sentiment, usability was examined through the ISO 9241-11 model, which highlighted persistent issues in effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. The results uncovered recurring problems in instability ( e.g ., crashes), performance slowness ( e.g ., delayed responsiveness), User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) shortcomings ( e.g ., confusing layouts), authentication difficulties ( e.g ., login failures), feature limitations ( e.g ., missing functions), and insufficient customer support ( e.g ., unresponsive assistance). Saudi banks should continuously enhance their apps by systematically analyzing user feedback, identifying recurring usability issues, and fixing key emerging problems. Early resolution of critical issues in mobile banking apps, coupled with continuous refinement, enhances customer loyalty and sustains competitiveness within the rapidly evolving digital financial ecosystem.",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates the performance of a deep learning framework supported by a cross-replication strategy for predicting Alzheimer’s disease (AD) from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). EfficientNetV2-B0 was selected due to its favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off. The workflow consisted of two stages: (i) clustering-based relabeling of the full dataset into five clinically meaningful categories, and (ii) training a classifier on the relabeled data. To assess the stability of the proposed approach, the model was trained across multiple random initializations on a fixed train/validation/test split. Class-wise Average Precision, macro- and micro-averaged Precision-Recall Area Under the Curve (PR–AUC) and Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC–AUC), and their 95% confidence intervals were reported using bootstrap resampling. The cross-replication strategy yielded improved stability across initializations, with a mean test accuracy of 0.95 compared with 0.94 for the single-run baseline, along with consistently higher PR–AUC and ROC–AUC values. These findings suggest that cross-replication enhances the reliability of AD stage prediction by reducing performance variability due to stochastic initialization, although further evaluation with alternative data partitions or external validation cohorts is warranted.",

    "Abstract": "Multi-modal fake news detection is a technique designed to identify and classify fake news by integrating information from multiple modalities. However, existing multi-modal fake news detection models have significant limitations in capturing structural information when processing social context. The core issue stems from the reliance on simple linear aggregation or static attention mechanisms in existing graph detection methods, which are inadequate for effectively capturing complex long-distance propagation relationships and multi-layered social network structures. Furthermore, existing multi-modal detection approaches are limited by the feature representations within the respective semantic spaces of each modality. The semantic gaps between modalities lead to misalignment during information fusion, making it difficult to fully achieve modality complementarity. To address these issues, we propose GINMCL, a graph isomorphism network-driven modality enhancement and cross-modal consistency learning method for multi-modal fake news detection. This method builds on the extraction of text and image features by incorporating graph isomorphism networks (GIN) based on the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) injective aggregation mechanism to effectively capture both local dependencies and global relationships within social graphs. Modality consistency learning aligns text, image, and social graph information into a shared latent semantic space, enhancing modality correlations. Additionally, to overcome the limitations of traditional methods in modality fusion strategies, we leverage a hard negative contrastive learning mechanism, which softens the penalty on negative samples and optimizes contrastive loss, further improving the accuracy and robustness of the model. We conducted systematic evaluations of GINMCL on the Pheme and Weibo datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that GINMCL outperforms existing methods across all metrics, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

    "Abstract": "Recommender systems (RSs), which provide recommendations tailored to user preferences, are valuable in managing overloaded information. Traditional recommendation systems usually function as black-box models and lack explanation; as a result, user trust and system transparency are adversely affected. Explainable RSs (XRSs) aim to overcome this issue by providing interpretable justifications for recommendations. Previous XRS studies suffer from limited integration of user reviews with knowledge graphs (KGs), resulting in incomplete user preference modeling and lack of interpretability. Although improvements in XRSs have been achieved worldwide, studies on Arabic RSs a lack advanced tools and explanation methods, such as KGs, because of resource limitations, the challenges posed by the Arabic language, and its different dialects. This study introduces Shareh, an explainable KG-based Arabic recommender that utilizes meta-path-guided reasoning and graph attention networks to fuse user reviews with a heterogeneous Arabic KG. Experimental results on the Books Reviews Arabic Dataset show that Shareh improves mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE) by approximately 30% compared to baseline models. The system, which has a model fidelity score of 99.76%, effectively backs nearly all recommendations with reasonable explanations. Such high fidelity indicates that the produced explanations accurately reflect the fundamental concepts of the model, thereby improving the system’s interpretability and reliability and increasing user trust.",

Resting energy expenditure (REE), exercise energy expenditure (EEE), energy expenditure rate (EER), respiratory quotient (RQ), fat energy supply rate (FESR), fat energy supply proportion (FESP), fat oxidation amount (FOA), fat oxidation rate (FOR), sugar energy supply rate (SESR), sugar energy supply proportion (SESP), sugar oxidation amount (SOA), sugar oxidation rate (SOR), rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and feeling scale (FS) was measured before exercise, during exercise in class, during a 3-h recovery period after class, and for 4 consecutive days after class. Results EEE, FOA, and FESP were significantly lower ( P &lt; 0.01) for open motor skills but higher ( P &lt; 0.01) for SESP than for closed motor skills during in-class practice. Within 3 h of recovery after class, EEE, FOA, FESP, and FS were significantly higher for open motor skills than for closed motor skills ( P &lt; 0.05), but lower for SOA, SOA, SESP, and RPE than for closed motor skills ( P &lt; 0.01). Within 4 consecutive days after training, the REE for open motor skills was higher than pre-training ( P &lt; 0.05) on days 1 and 2, and higher than closed motor skills ( P &lt; 0.05) on day 1. The RQ of open motor skills was lower than that of pre-exercise and closed motor skills on day 1 and day 2 after exercise ( P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.05), whereas both REE and RQ of closed motor skills were not significantly different from pre-exercise at 4 days. Conclusion (1) Open and closed motor skills have similar effects in promoting lipid and glucose metabolism, but open motor skills have a higher perception of exercise experience. (2) During exercise, open motor skills are more dependent on glucose supply than closed motor skills. However, during the recovery period, open motor skills are more fat-fueled and glycogen is more likely to be resynthesized to replenish depleted glycogen during exercise. (3) Open motor skills are superior to closed motor skills in increasing resting metabolic levels and fat metabolism efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Background While systemic muscle loss is associated with physical dysfunction, the role of localized upper extremities muscle deterioration in hand disability remains unclear in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We aimed to explore the impact of low muscle mass in upper extremities on hand dysfunction in patients with RA. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in a Chinese RA population and control subjects. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Hand function assessment included handgrip strength and hand disability according to the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI). Muscle mass was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis and muscle mass index of upper extremities (MMI UE ) was calculated. Logistic regression analyses evaluated associations between MMI UE and hand dysfunction. Results A total of 1,104 RA patients and 3,281 control subjects were included in this study. RA patients exhibited lower MMI UE compared with controls (1.42 ± 0.32 vs. 1.73 ± 0.40 kg/m 2 , P &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of low MMI UE was higher in RA patients (45.9%, 507/1104) than in controls (14.5%, 475/3,281, P &lt; 0.001). Among RA patients, 57.2% (632/1,104) had low handgrip strength and 39.6% (437/1,104) had HAQ-DI hand disability. RA patients with low MMI UE showed significantly poorer hand function than those with normal MMI UE , including lower handgrip strength (14.59 ± 6.78 vs. 18.67 ± 8.14 kg), higher prevalence of low handgrip strength (70.0% vs. 46.4%) and HAQ-DI hand disability (46.9% vs. 33.3%, all P &lt; 0.001) than those with normal MMI UE . Logistic regression analyses showed that RA patients with low MMI UE had higher risks of low handgrip strength (AOR = 2.44, 95% CI [1.84–3.23], P &lt; 0.001) and HAQ-DI hand disability (AOR = 1.59, 95% CI [1.15–2.19], P = 0.005). Conclusions The present cross-sectional study demonstrates that localized low muscle mass of the upper extremities is associated with hand dysfunction in RA, independent of inflammation. These findings support the need for further longitudinal studies to explore the potential benefits of incorporating routine muscle assessments into RA care.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a recognized risk factor for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), but the molecular mechanisms behind this association are still unclear. This study aims to reveal shared key genes and pathways involved in both COPD and LUAD, and identify potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Methods Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) data was performed to evaluate genetic causality. Differential expression analysis was performed on GSE76925 (COPD) and GSE116959 (LUAD), followed by LASSO regression, enrichment analysis, immune cell infiltration analysis, RNA modification analysis, competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network construction, and drug sensitivity prediction. Single-cell RNA sequencing data ( GSE270667 , GSE189357 ) were used to explore cell-type-specific expression, and qPCR was performed to validate gene expression in patient blood samples. Results MR confirmed the genetic relationship between COPD and LUAD. Three key genes ( FCRLA , GREM1 , and MMP9 ) were significantly upregulated and involved in immune regulation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. Single-cell analysis revealed that these genes were specifically expressed in B cells, T cells, and monocytes. Multiple omics analyses indicated epigenetic and RNA level regulation. Several candidate drugs have been identified. Conclusion FCRLA, GREM1 , and MMP9 are inflammation-associated genes that may link the pathobiology of COPD and LUAD, and serve as valuable biomarkers with therapeutic potential in high-risk populations.",

    "Abstract": "A new species of Croton, microendemic of the dry forests of northeastern Brazil in the state of Pernambuco, is here described. Morphological and ITS molecular data provide evidence for placing C. buiquensis sp. nov. as part of Croton section Pedicellati . Specimens of C. buiquensis had been previously identified in herbaria as C. pedicellatus , but the former can be distinguished from the latter by the hispid indumentum of the leaf blade, the ovate shape of the petals of staminate flowers, pistillate flowers with 4-fid to multifid styles, and a crossbow-shape caruncle. Evidence from ecological niche modeling points to other areas in the state of Pernambuco, specifically the “Agreste” region, as likely locations for the occurrence of the new species, which could be the target of future botanical surveys. Croton buiquensis is here provisionally considered as Critically Endangered based on IUCN criteria. This is the first record of multifid styles (more than six stigmatic tips) in C. sect. Pedicellati and also the first species of the section endemic to the state of Pernambuco.",

    "Abstract": "Background Tennis, characterized by intermittent high-intensity bursts, demands both aerobic and anaerobic energy pathways for optimal performance. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has emerged as a potential method to enhance athletic outcomes. This study aimed to explore the impact of RIPC on anaerobic capacity, specifically the maximal accumulated oxygen deficit (MAOD), in well-trained college tennis players. Methods In a single-blinded, randomized, controlled crossover design, 16 participants (eight men and eight women; age: 20.9 ± 1.4 years; height: 1.73 ± 0.76 m; weight: 63.5 ± 8.2 kg; BMI: 21.2 ± 1.4 kg/m 2 ) completed supramaximal intensity tests across baseline, placebo, and RIPC conditions. RIPC involved alternating bilateral occlusion of 220 or 20 mmHg for 4 × 5 min applied to both arms. Subsequently, the subjects performed a supramaximal test on the treadmill at 110% VO 2max intensity until exhaustion. Results The results indicated that RIPC had no discernible effect on time to exhaustion compared to baseline or placebo conditions ( p &gt; 0.05). Moreover, parameters including MAOD ALT (Alternative MAOD, derived from the fast component of excess post-exercise oxygen consumption and oxygen equivalent for blood lactate accumulation), lactic anaerobic capacity, alactic anaerobic capacity, and excess post-exercise oxygen uptake dynamics remained comparable across the three interventions ( p &gt; 0.05). Notably, a strong correlation was observed between MAOD and MAOD ALT ( r = 0.739; p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion In conclusion, this study provides evidence that remote ischemic preconditioning did not improve anaerobic capacity, as indicated by MAOD, among well-trained college tennis players. These findings emphasize the nuanced interplay of physiological factors in the context of RIPC and suggest that its impact on anaerobic capacity may be limited within this athletic cohort.",

    "Abstract": "Myosin IXb (Myo9b) is a single-headed motor protein in the myosin superfamily. It contains a unique Rho guanosine triphosphatase-activating protein domain, which enables it to regulate cytoskeletal dynamics and cell migration. Most studies on Myo9b are focused on epithelial repair, intestinal barrier function, and immune cell motility; however, its roles in immune regulation, inflammatory responses, tumorigenesis, and various autoimmune diseases have garnered notable attention in recent years. This study comprehensively reviews the structural characteristics, regulatory mechanisms, and biological functions of Myo9b, along with emphasizing its crucial roles in various pathological conditions and its potential as a therapeutic target.",
