    "Abstract": "Importance Semaglutide reduces the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in adults with overweight or obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) but without diabetes. The cost-effectiveness and budget impact of semaglutide therapy could inform ongoing Medicare price negotiations but are uncertain. Objective To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of semaglutide for secondary prevention of CVD and potential effect on US health care spending. Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based cohort simulation study used the CVD Policy Model, a validated simulation model of CVD outcomes and costs in the US, to evaluate lifetime cost-effectiveness of semaglutide. The addition of lifetime treatment with weekly subcutaneous semaglutide to usual care compared with usual care alone in US adults age 45 years or older, with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 27 or higher, and history of myocardial infarction or stroke, without diabetes were evaluated. The model incorporated annual semaglutide cost of $8604 (2023 US price net of rebates and discounts) and adopted a health-system perspective. Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty. These data were analyzed from January 2024 and June 2025. Exposure Semaglutide and usual care compared with usual care alone. Main Outcomes and Measures Main outcomes were lifetime MACE (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke), incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), and change in annual US health care spending. Results Adding semaglutide to usual care in the estimated 4 million US adults without diabetes eligible for secondary prevention of CVD is projected to avert 358 400 MACE at a cost of $148 100 per QALY gained (95% uncertainty interval, $127 100-$173 400). The mean age of this cohort was 66 years and 55% were male and 45% were female. Treatment with semaglutide was projected to increase annual health care spending by $23 billion. Semaglutide would be cost-effective at a threshold of $120 000 per QALY gained if the annual cost were lowered an additional 18% to $7055. Semaglutide is cost-effective for this indication at the cash price currently available to self-paying customers ($5988; incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $99 600 per QALY gained). Conclusions and Relevance Semaglutide for secondary prevention of CVD in US adults with overweight or obesity but without diabetes is projected to yield meaningful health benefits. Lowering annual drug costs by 18% from $8604 to $7055—or making the current cash price available to all patients—would make semaglutide cost-effective at $120 000 per QALY gained.",

    "Abstract": "Importance Before elective surgery, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are discontinued following a standardized protocol. However, this could result in insufficient lowering of DOAC levels that could increase bleeding risk. Objective To estimate the proportion of patients with elevated DOAC levels at the time of elective surgery, evaluate factors associated with DOAC levels, and examine associated blood loss. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study (DOAC Level Prior to Incision [DALI]) assessed adult patients prescribed a DOAC (apixaban, dabigatran, or rivaroxaban) for any indication and at any dose, undergoing an elective procedure requiring DOAC interruption between May 27, 2018, and February 25, 2024, at 2 Dutch hospitals. Exposure Standardized interruption protocol (1 day before moderate- and 2 days before high bleeding-risk procedures) with interruption adjustments for the patient’s kidney function. Main Outcomes and Measures Blood was drawn immediately before surgery to determine DOAC levels (by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry). Proportions of preoperative DOAC levels of 30 ng/mL or higher and their 95% CIs were estimated, stratified by DOAC type and surgical bleeding risk. Factors associated with DOAC levels were identified through multivariable linear regression. Surgical blood loss and 30-day postoperative complications were described according to DOAC concentrations. Results The study was terminated after including 257 patients (100 receiving apixaban, 100 receiving rivaroxaban, and 57 receiving dabigatran due to the slow inclusion rate of those receiving dabigatran; median [IQR] age, 72 [66-78] years; 173 male [67%]); 212 patients (82%) underwent a high bleeding-risk operation. Preprocedural DOAC levels were 30 ng/mL or higher in 7.6% (95% CI, 4.9%-11.6%) of patients. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban had similar proportions, whereas 13.1% (95% CI, 7.8%-21.2%) of patients treated with apixaban had levels of 30 ng/mL or higher. Treatment with apixaban, decreased kidney function, and a shorter interruption time were associated with higher levels. Surgical blood loss (median [range], 0 [0-4250] mL) was not associated with DOAC levels. Twelve patients (4.7%; 95% CI, 2.7%-8.0%), who all had DOAC levels less than 30 ng/mL, experienced major bleeding. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, most patients following the current protocol had DOAC levels less than 30 ng/mL, although the proportion of patients with elevated levels was higher for apixaban. Preoperative DOAC levels were not associated with blood loss during surgery.",

    "Abstract": "Importance Survivors of infant heart surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD) have high risk for neurodevelopmental (ND) disorders; few multistate data report the percentage with ND diagnosis or utilization across health care settings. Objective To characterize time to and cumulative prevalence of any ND diagnosis and associated health care utilization in the first 5 years after infant heart surgery for publicly insured children. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study included children with CHD with a birth hospitalization and infant cardiac surgery between January 2016 and December 2020. Data were obtained from the Merative MarketScan Medicaid Claims Database of deidentified individual Medicaid enrollees across 12 states. Data were analyzed from December 13, 2022, to October 4, 2024. Exposures CHD and infant heart surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures Times from index surgery to first ND diagnosis and ND utilization and their cumulative prevalences by 5 years after index surgery. Results Among 3147 patients (mean [SD] duration of enrollment, 30.5 [17.4] months), 1686 (53.6%) were male; 619 (19.7%) were Black, 228 (7.2%) were Hispanic, 1051 (33.4%) were White, 145 (4.5%) belonged to additional racial and ethnic groups, and 1108 (35.2%) had missing data on race and ethnicity. Surgery was neonatal (&amp;amp;lt;30 days) in 1518 (48.2%); 709 (22.5%) had a genetic diagnosis; and highest Risk Adjustment for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-2) category was 1 for 945 patients (30.0%), 2 for 915 (29.1%), 3 for 398 (12.9%), 4 for 577 (18.3%), and 5 for 312 (9.9%). The cumulative prevalences of 1 or more ND diagnoses and use of 1 or more forms of ND services were, respectively, 43.5% (95% CI, 42.2%-44.7%) and 80.0% (95% CI, 78.9%-80.9%) at 3 years and 51.7% (95% CI, 50.4%-52.9%) and 82.9% (95% CI, 81.9%-83.8%) at 5 years. Although 1752 (55.7%) had ND screening, fewer had psychological or neuropsychological (207 [6.6%]) or comprehensive developmental (268 [8.5%]) evaluation. Independent risk factors for time to first ND diagnosis were Black race (hazard ratio [HR], 1.14 [95% CI, 1.00-1.30]; P = .04) or Hispanic ethnicity (HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.02-1.50]; P = .03) compared with White race and RACHS-2 category 4 (HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 1.09-1.49]; P = .002) or 5 (HR, 1.32 [95% CI, 1.08-1.61]; P = .007) compared with category 1.

Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of publicly insured children who underwent infant heart surgery, the prevalence of ND disorders and utilization of ND services was high. Developmental screening percentages were comparable with those in general pediatric samples, but few children received society-recommended formal ND evaluations.",

    "Abstract": "Importance Substance use disorder (SUD) is commonly found in individuals with schizophrenia, with a high co-occurrence rate of approximately 41.7%. Despite this high prevalence, people with both schizophrenia and SUD are frequently excluded from clinical trials and systematic reviews; this special group is particularly challenging to treat and imposes a significant economic burden on health care systems. Objective To evaluate the efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability of psychological and psychosocial interventions in patients with schizophrenia and co-occurring SUD. Data Sources The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group registry was searched up to January 13, 2025. Data analysis was performed from March to April 2025. Study Selection Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) examining psychological and psychosocial interventions compared with control groups in adults with schizophrenia and concomitant SUD were identified. No restrictions were applied regarding the type of substance used, including alcohol, cannabis, nicotine, and stimulants, such as amphetamines. Data Extraction and Synthesis A systematic review and random-effect pairwise meta-analyses were conducted to estimate standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals and were reported following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) reporting guidelines. Confidence in the estimate was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were overall symptoms and substance use reduction measured by validated scales at posttreatment. Results A total of 35 RCTs were included (4136 participants), with 29 trials involving 3831 participants contributing to pairwise meta-analyses comparing psychological and psychosocial interventions with control conditions. Among the 3748 participants with reported sex, 951 (25.4%) were female, and mean (range) age was 37.2 (20.6-57.5) years. A very small effect favoring the intervention group was observed in reducing overall symptoms (SMD, –0.11; 95% CI, –0.27 to 0.05; 13 trials; low confidence in the estimate), mainly driven by nicotine studies. No difference was found between intervention and control groups in reducing all types of substance use (SMD, –0.01; 95% CI, –0.21 to 0.18; 8 trials; moderate confidence). When considered separately, alcohol, cannabis, amphetamines, and other stimulants showed similar no-effect results, while nicotine use indicated a small effect. Conclusion and Relevance The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that current psychological and psychosocial interventions provide limited benefit in reducing symptoms and no effect in reducing substance use in individuals with schizophrenia and SUD compared to control conditions, with the exception of nicotine use, highlighting the urgent need to develop more effective treatment strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Importance Sleep plays a critical role in postoperative recovery, influencing immune function, pain perception, neurocognitive performance, and wound healing. Although surgical interventions are known to disrupt sleep, the extent and trajectory of these disruptions across varying procedural risks remain poorly characterized. Objective To characterize postoperative alterations in sleep stages and determine how these trajectories vary across different surgical procedures. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study used wearable device–derived sleep data linked to electronic health records from US participants in the prospectively maintained All of Us Research Program database. Adults undergoing surgery from January 2012 to December 2024 with 90 days or more of preoperative and 30 days or more of postoperative wearable sleep data were included. Data analyses were performed from July to November 2025. Exposure Surgical intervention stratified by procedural risk levels. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was sleep metrics, including total sleep and rapid eye movement (REM), deep, light, and wake-stage durations, compared across 9 postoperative epochs and stratified by surgical risk (low, intermediate, or high). Linear mixed-effects models were fitted for each metric with opioid exposure, dose, and patient age as covariates. Association between each sleep metric and postoperative complications was assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results A total of 634 unique surgical procedures in 512 patients were included in the analytic cohort; median (IQR) patient age at the time of surgery was 59 (46-67) years, and 558 patients (88.0%) were female. High-risk procedures were associated with significant and sustained mean (SD) reductions in REM and deep sleep through postoperative day 7 (deep: Δ, –18.7 [48.6] minutes; P &amp;amp;lt; .001; REM: Δ, –12.4 [30.1] minutes; P &amp;amp;lt; .001), while total sleep was reduced acutely (Δ, –19.4 [145.3] minutes; P = .004). Light sleep decreased transiently; wake-stage duration increased significantly (mean [SD] Δ, +13.9 [31.8] minutes; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). Intermediate-risk procedures were associated with milder disruptions, primarily limited to days 0 through 3. In contrast, low-risk procedures were not associated with significant changes in any sleep metric at any postoperative epoch. Opioid exposure was associated with increased light (β, approximately +5.1 minutes; P &amp;amp;lt; .001) and wake-stage (+10.2 minutes; P &amp;amp;lt; .001) durations but suppressed deep sleep (–5.1 minutes; P &amp;amp;lt; .001). Age was similarly linked to greater wake-stage sleep (+0.30 minutes/y) and reduced restorative sleep (–0.05 minutes/y). Finally, each 10-minute reduction in change in total sleep duration was associated with higher odds of Clavien-Dindo grades I and II complications (adjusted odd ratio, 1.13 per 10 minutes; 95% CI, 1.04-1.24; P = .006). Conclusions and Relevance Per the results of this cohort study, sleep architecture is differentially disrupted following surgery, with the greatest and most prolonged impairments occurring after high-risk procedures, with REM and deep sleep being most affected.",

    "Abstract": "Importance As trauma care–related demand continues to rise, the US trauma system’s current utilization and ability to accommodate surges from mass casualty events or disasters remain uncertain. Understanding existing trauma bed occupancy and reserve capacity is essential for national preparedness. Objective To assess the current occupancy and distribution of adult trauma-designated beds across US hospitals and evaluate the system’s ability to absorb a sudden and sustained surge in trauma volume. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study analyzed 121 weeks (January 2022–April 2024) of facility-level bed availability and occupancy data from the US Department of Health and Human Services for 2027 hospitals with trauma center designation. Simulation modeling was conducted to evaluate bed capacity under various casualty influx scenarios, assuming a 10% allocation (n = 3610) of the 36 101 adult-trauma designated beds in level I/II centers nationwide. Exposures Various casualty influx scenarios. Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcomes included mean weekly occupancy rates for adult inpatient and intensive care unit (ICU) beds by trauma center level and region, percentage of centers exceeding 80% occupancy for prolonged durations, and simulated bed deficits under sustained patient influx scenarios. Results Level I and II trauma centers consistently operated at high occupancy, exceeding 80% for inpatient beds and 75% for ICU beds across most regions. Nearly 80% of level I/II centers in the South and West exceeded 80% inpatient occupancy for 75 weeks or longer. In contrast, level III and lower-level centers showed lower occupancy but notable regional variation. Simulation modeling revealed that at sustained influx rates of 1500 to 2000 patients per day, national trauma bed deficits exceeded 20 000 beds within 45 days. Even modest influxes of 241 patients per day saturated all designated trauma beds within 90 days under dynamic length-of-stay assumptions. Conclusions and Relevance The US trauma system, particularly its tertiary centers (level I/II) are operating under sustained high occupancy with limited reserve capacity for patient surges. These findings highlight the urgent need for national trauma capacity planning, regional load-balancing mechanisms, and scalable infrastructure to enhance trauma system resilience.",

    "Abstract": "AlphaFold models provide static structural predictions, limiting their use in interpreting flexible regions in low‐resolution cryo‐EM maps. Here, we assess whether AlphaFold‐generated distograms can instead reveal conformational flexibility, focusing on binding‐induced hinge motions. For this, we examined the key metabolic AK2/AIFM1 complex, where molecular dynamics and cryo‐EM confirm a hinge motion in AK2 upon binding. Notably, this motion is captured in the AlphaFold2/3 distograms of apo AK2, even though it is absent in the predicted structures. By extending our analysis to other systems, we demonstrate that distograms may offer a valuable, model‐independent method for interpreting ambiguous hinge regions in cryo‐EM maps. Impact statement We reveal that AlphaFold distograms can successfully predict binding‐induced hinge motions. This establishes distograms as a valuable, structure‐free metric for identifying alternative conformational states, aiding the interpretation of ambiguous densities in cryo‐EM maps.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The networked stochastic systems (NSSs) affected by disturbances and bias injection attacks (BIAs) are studied, which are representative in practical engineering applications. To mitigate the negative impact of disturbances and BIAs on the NSSs, the interconnected observers include stochastic disturbance observer (SDO) and a stochastic attack observer (SAO), have been designed, which can effectively leverage the available information. In a more general sense, the additional attack information is generated when the BIA occurs, and then the neural network (NN) method is used to approximate it by selecting an appropriate neural network basis function. On this basis, the compound observer‐based controller is constructed to compensate for the disturbances and BIAs, ensuring that the systems can converge to a bounded region. Finally, the proposed scheme is demonstrated to be effective through simulation experiments.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Excessive and continuous production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a significant factor contributing to severe inflammation, bacterial infections, and poor angiogenesis, and it can also delay the healing of diabetic wounds. However, traditional clinical treatment methods are unable to effectively eliminate ROS. Herein, a dual ROS‐scavenging platform that integrates multifunctional niobium carbide (Nb 2 C) reinforced with curcumin (Cur) with UV‐crosslinked hydrogel microneedles (MN) is presented. In this system, Cur, acting as the primary scavenger, can rapidly neutralize extracellular ROS. Under near‐infrared (NIR) irradiation, the embedded Nb 2 C not only triggers the on‐demand release of curcumin but also, through its enzyme‐like peroxidase‐mimicking activity, acts as a secondary scavenger to eliminate deep intracellular ROS, thus providing a two‐stage antioxidant defense mechanism. This NIR‐enhanced dual‐action synergistic effect can balance the oxidative microenvironment, promote the repolarization of macrophages from the M1 type to the M2 type, facilitate angiogenesis, and produce a powerful photothermal combined antibacterial effect. The results of in vivo experiments indicate that the use of Nb 2 C‐CurCD‐GelMA MNs can significantly accelerate the healing of full‐thickness diabetic wounds. The mechanism lies in coordinating the reduction of inflammation and tissue regeneration. This study offers a sophisticated and safe treatment strategy for refractory diabetic wounds.",

While conventional fiber‐based actuators often rely on multi‐material assemblies and complex interfacial engineering, their performance is limited by structural heterogeneity and low‐efficient energy coupling. This review highlights the emerging paradigm of single‐fiber or in‐fiber artificial muscle design, where actuation functionality is intrinsically encoded within the molecular architecture of individual fibers. We comprehensively examine state‐of‐the‐art material systems such as phase‐transition materials, block copolymer self‐assemblies, mechanically interlocked polymers, covalent supramolecular hybrids, and woven polymer networks. Particular emphasis is placed on the structure–property–function relationships that govern the actuation strain, stress output, response speed, and long‐term durability. We also propose a unified framework for evaluating single fiber actuator performance based on key metrics and critically discuss manufacturing challenges, scalability, and integration with smart sensing system. This review provides a roadmap for molecular design of the high‐performance artificial muscle, offering new strategies for intelligent actuation and soft material systems in real‐world applications.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT As a renewable energy source, wave energy exploitation reduces fossil energy pollution and aids carbon neutrality. Traditional electromagnetic generators (EMGs) have low low‐frequency conversion efficiency, limiting large‐scale application. Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), invented in 2012, offer a new way for wave energy harvesting with advantages of wide material selection, low‐frequency adaptability, light weight and low cost, but are restricted by marine corrosion and inefficient low‐frequency capture. This work designed an arch‐structured TENG (Arch‐TENG) that captures wave energy via bending. Compared with CS‐TENG, its charge transfer increases by over 450%, with a charge output density of 12.7 nC cm 2 at 0.5 Hz and stable performance after 26 h tests. The array‐integrated device capable of large‐scale wave energy harvesting is designed based on the Arch‐TENG. It was verified that this device can not only stably power low‐power electronic devices but also be used for cathodic protection tests of carbon steel Q235 in seawater, which will provide more practical applications of TENG in marine environments.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In situ monitoring of the temperature distribution on a turbine blade can enhance the real‐time evaluation of air‐cooling efficacy and facilitate the optimization of cooling channel designs. Microfabricated thin‐film thermocouples (TFTCs) provide next‐generation in situ temperature monitoring solutions for turbine designers, delivering precise temperature measurement and quick response time. However, significant challenges persist in the conformal and monolithic integration of thermocouple arrays, especially on surfaces with complex geometries and varying curvatures, like those on actual turbine blades. This study has introduced a new method for the conformal integration of thin‐film thermocouple arrays on continuously variable curvatures in a single microfabrication process, while maintaining the aerodynamic performance of the turbine blades. By using 3D‐printed shadow masks during sputtering processes, this method tackles the difficulties of conformal metal alloy thin‐film formation caused by twisted curvatures in conventional microfabrication. E‐type TFTCs are conformally microfabricated using a 3D shadow sputtering process on turbine blade test structure surfaces, forming an on‐blade in situ temperature characterization network. These microfabricated thin‐film thermocouples act as a toolbox for characterizing the temperature distribution on air‐cooled turbine blade surfaces. Furthermore, the proposed method presents a strategy for conformal microfabrication and integration of thin‐film sensors on multi‐scale complex industrial surfaces.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Since the advent of synthetic hydrogels, their capabilities have expanded steadily, and their application landscape has broadened. However, low strength and toughness continue to hinder engineering deployment. Despite notable progress in high‐strength, tough hydrogels, the inherent strength‐toughness trade‐off remains unresolved. Bioinspired structural design has emerged as a powerful paradigm to overcome this limitation. This review synthesizes recent advances in strong and tough hydrogels through a dimension‐based framework (spanning one‐dimensional fibers, two‐dimensional films, and three‐dimensional bulk architectures) by examining biological archetypes, fabrication strategies, structural–property relationships, and application potentials. We elucidate the underlying mechanisms by which bioinspired designs enhance mechanical performance and outline pathways for their implementation in functional systems. We highlight the convergence of interdisciplinary approaches with advanced manufacturing technologies as key to enabling scalable and adaptive hydrogel systems for use in flexible electronics, tissue engineering, and intelligent soft robotics.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms (pNEN) are rarely encountered, accounting for about 2% of all pancreatic neoplasms. Disease progression is frequently observed as recurrence or distal metastasis. Mechanisms underlying pNEN progression are still poorly investigated, and treatments against pNEN are challenging due to the pronounced neoplastic heterogeneity. Here, by performing clinicomolecular analysis, we report a novel mechanism of positive regulatory circuit between Cav1.2‐mediated calcium signaling and epigenetic control by H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac). Tumor‐cell‐specific expression of Cav1.2 strongly contributes to disease progression and correlates with malignant biological behaviors of pNEN. Moreover, we find calcium channel blockers (CCBs), especially amlodipine, remarkably inhibit pNEN progression in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, administration of CCBs correlates with better progression‐free survival (PFS) and a lower rate of distal metastasis. Our work uncovers the novel mechanism of the Cav1.2‐epigenetic circuit and expands the scope of therapeutic strategy for further investigation in pNEN.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) of polymers underlies the formation of biomolecular condensates and offers a versatile route to functional soft materials. Traditionally, LLPS is attributed to changes in solvent quality or associative coacervation, but here a purely entropic connectivity‐driven mechanism is demonstrated: reversible crosslinking. Using coarse‐grained simulations of a minimal bead–spring model in good solvent, it is shown that transient, pairwise crosslinks alone can drive phase separation at ultralow polymer densities, yielding highly swollen, water‐rich condensates. The phase behavior exhibits closed‐loop coexistence and re‐entrant percolation. This is captured quantitatively by a mean‐field Semenov–Rubinstein theory with a single fit parameter, the effective repulsion parameter. Notably, phase boundaries are largely robust to rearrangements of crosslinkable domains along the sequence; only highly blocky sequences appreciably reduce the phase separation region and can even convert condensates into micelles or connected micelle networks. These results establish an entropy‐enabled mechanism for mesoscale organization and suggest routes to programmable, membraneless materials in synthetic and RNA‐protein contexts.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Magnetoelectric materials, which generate electric fields in response to alternating magnetic stimulation, are increasingly recognized for their applications in neuromodulation, tissue engineering, wireless drug delivery, and cancer treatment. This study addresses the cytotoxicity concerns associated with heavy metals in traditional magnetoelectric composites by introducing a heat‐mediated magnetoelectric approach utilizing biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticles and pyroelectric polymers, thereby enhancing biomedical safety. The nanoparticles were synthesized with controlled size and shape via thermal decomposition of iron oleate, employing an in situ temperature labeling technique that simplifies the synthesis process and ensures uniform particle formation. These nanoparticles, optimized for high heating efficiency, were combined with the pyroelectric polymer P(VDF‐TrFE) to create composite films that exhibit a heat‐mediated magnetoelectric effect. This effect involves an alternating magnetic field heating the nanoparticles, leading to reversible material depolarization and the generation of a pyroelectric current. We explored the magnetopyroelectric effect on cell differentiation, demonstrating excellent biocompatibility with neural progenitor cells and significant enhancement in neuronal differentiation, attributed to the synergistic effects of heat and electricity. The pro‐differentiation mechanism of magnetopyroelectric stimulation involves phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase AKT pathway and calcium signaling. This heat‐mediated magnetoelectric approach not only presents a potential for applications such as neuronal repair and targeted drug delivery but also provides a safer and more versatile alternative to conventional magnetoelectric materials.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Memristive devices are promising building blocks for next‐generation memory and neuromorphic circuits in artificial intelligence. Among them, filamentary memristors offer great potential for high‐performance and densely integrated systems. However, achieving both low‐power operation and long‐term cycling stability remains a key challenge. Here, we present a 2D AgCrS 2 volatile memristor that operates via a novel cation‐driven valence change mechanism (CVCM). Unlike traditional filament‐based conduction, this mechanism enables Ag + ‐driven switching without metal filament growth. The threshold switching process is governed by the reversible intercalation of highly mobile Ag + ions into tetrahedral vacancies between CrS 2 layers, forming and rupturing the highly conductive Ag 2 CrS 2 pathway and thus delivering an on/off ratio exceeding 10 5 at 0.1 V. The AgCrS 2 memristor enables a reduced threshold voltage of 0.2 V and an ultralow power consumption down to 200 pW when the compliance current is further reduced to the nA level. Additionally, the absence of elemental Ag metallization in the switching layer prevents structural degradation, enabling stable operation for over 3 × 10 5 switching cycles. These findings establish CVCM as a promising way for developing energy‐efficient and reliable memristive technologies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT CuCrP 2 S 6 is a van der Waals multiferroic where the tunable Cu + sublattice underpins its exceptional ferroelectric and electronic switching properties. Yet, the microscopic mechanism governing Cu + ordering has remained elusive. Here, we combine single‐crystal X‐ray and neutron diffraction with pair distribution function analysis to uncover a temperature‐driven evolution of Cu + ordering, giving rise to an incommensurate quasi‐antipolar phase between the paraelectric and antiferroelectric states. The modulation originates from correlated Cu + occupancy redistribution coupled to breathing distortion of surrounding S 3 triangles, establishing a symmetry‐adapted lattice distortion mode. Diffuse scattering persisting over 35 K above the transition confirms that the structural instability follows an order‐disorder mechanism. The spontaneous off‐centering of Cu + positions CuCrP 2 S 6 as a model platform for correlated order‐disorder phenomena in 2D layered ferroics, and provides design principles for next‐generation memory and logic devices.",

Herein, we address this challenge through a dual‐modification strategy, synthesizing a Cl‐terminated MXene/MAX (Ti 3 C 2 Cl x /Ti 3 ZnC 2 ) heterostructure by a dynamic etching approach for efficient electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). This catalyst achieves an NH 3 yield of 20.1 µg h −1 mg −1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 38.1% at −0.2 V vs. RHE in 0.1 m KOH electrolyte, with high stability for over 70 h, positioning it among the top‐performing MXene‐based NRR electrocatalysts. Experimental and theoretical analyses demonstrate that the Ti 3 C 2 Cl x /Ti 3 ZnC 2 heterostructure modulates the electronic structure of Ti sites, thus optimizing the intermediate adsorption and reducing the energy barrier of *NH 2 → NH 3 conversion in the distal pathway to 0.7 eV. The Zn‐N 2 battery assembled with Ti 3 C 2 Cl x /Ti 3 ZnC 2 can reach a peak power density of 36.5 µW cm −2 , with an NH 3 yield of 13.1 µg h −1 mg −1 . This study has demonstrated that the dual modification strategy involving surface terminations regulation and heterostructure construction is effective to improve both NRR activity and stability of MXene‐based electrocatalysts, which is crucial for efficient NH 3 production and energy generation. This improvement paves the way for efficient ammonia and energy co‐generation, providing a viable materials design strategy and deeper mechanistic insights.",

Finite‐element analysis identifies a critical inter‐pore spacing approximately 20 times the pore radius as necessary to minimize electric field coupling, enabling rational array design.

Diverse nanopore arrays with 75 nm pores and 800 nm spacing are utilized for the specific detection of alpha‐fetoprotein. Detection of alpha‐fetoprotein demonstrates label‐free sensing at concentrations down to ∼3 fM across six orders of magnitude in dynamic range.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Radioulnar synostosis with amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia type 2 (RUSAT‐2) is a rare inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by congenital or progressive thrombocytopenia, frequent radioulnar synostosis, and variable multisystem involvement. It is caused by heterozygous germline pathogenic variants in the MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus ( MECOM ) gene, which encodes transcription factors essential for hematopoietic stem cell regulation and embryonic development. Disruption of highly conserved zinc finger domains within MECOM impairs long‐term hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, leading to amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and, in many cases, progression to pancytopenia. Although MECOM is also implicated in leukemogenesis through somatic dysregulation, germline variants associated with RUSAT‐2 result in a distinct developmental and hematologic phenotype with highly variable penetrance and age of onset. As of 2025, there were approximately 66 reported cases of RUSAT‐2 reported in the literature, with clinical severity ranging from isolated thrombocytopenia to early‐onset bone marrow failure requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This review summarizes the current understanding of the genetic basis, clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, clinical course, management considerations, and outstanding mechanistic questions surrounding RUSAT‐2.",

NDs are the results of multifactorial processes causing pleiotropic changes in molecular and protein networks linking a host of biological processes that lead to protein dysregulation and aggregation that ultimately leads to neurodegeneration. Genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic studies have been instrumental to identify novel genes and proteins implicated on diseases that point to novel disease mechanism, as well as the identification of disease biomarkers.

Although digital technologies play a central role in advancing ESG practices, little is known about how technology leaders, the senior technology managers in top management teams (TMT), influence ESG performance. This study draws on upper‐echelons theory, resource‐based view, and role theory to explore how technology leader presence (TLP) affects ESG performance in construction firms. Using a sample of Chinese listed construction companies from 2010 to 2022 and applying ordered logit, ordinary least squares and propensity score matching, we find that TLP is positively correlated with ESG performance in construction enterprises, moderated by strategic (i.e., digital transformation and voluntary corporate social responsibility [CSR] disclosure) and upper‐echelon (i.e., TMT age) factors. We also find that TLP improves ESG performance through green innovation. Our findings contribute to the literature on ESG and technology leadership and offer actionable implications for construction practitioners seeking to strengthen ESG outcomes via technology leadership. Given the sample's focus on Chinese construction firms, future research should extend this inquiry across industries and national contexts.",

To bridge this gap, 103 peer‐reviewed articles, published from 2000 to 2025 from the Scopus and Web of Science (WOS) databases were examined utilizing the SPAR‐4‐SLR (Scientific Procedures and Rationales for Systematic Literature Reviews) protocol along with TCCM (Theory, Context, Characteristics, and Methodology) and ADO (Antecedents‐Decisions‐Outcomes) frameworks. The research identifies four primary antecedent categories, namely, brand‐specific, consumer‐oriented, cultural/experiential, and influencer/advocacy that influence coolness perceptions. Brand connection results involve increased emotional attachment, brand affection, advocacy, and a propensity to pay a premium. Mediating effects arise from psychological processes and value‐based mechanisms, whereas demographics, customer traits, and service quality function as moderators. A novel conceptual framework of BC is demonstrated by conducting expert interviews with 17 branding professionals and academicians, providing theoretical and management insights. The results designate BC as a unique research field and underscore its strategic importance in differentiation and relationship development. Future study avenues are proposed to enhance comprehension within digital, cultural, and sustainability frameworks.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used in quantum chemistry, but their reliability hinges on uncertainty quantification (UQ). In this study, we compare two prominent UQ paradigms—deep evidential regression (DER) and deep ensembles—on the QM9 and WS22 datasets, with a specific emphasis on the role of post hoc calibration. Raw uncertainties from both methods were systematically miscalibrated: DER produced uncertainty estimates where data noise and model uncertainty were not cleanly separated, while ensembles produced sharper yet underconfident estimates. Applying calibration techniques such as isotonic regression (ISR), standard scaling, and GP‐Normal corrected these deficiencies, aligning predicted variances with observed errors. On QM9, calibration enabled DER to filter high‐confidence predictions more effectively than ensembles. On WS22, calibrated ensembles not only improved statistical reliability but also delivered substantial computational savings in active learning, reducing redundant ab initio evaluations by more than 20%. These results demonstrate that post hoc calibration is essential to transform uncertainty estimates from descriptive metrics into actionable signals, ensuring both trustworthy predictions and resource‐efficient molecular modeling.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Concern over the mental health of young people continues to increase. Over the last few decades, the field of education has been identified as being particularly well placed to promote physical and mental wellbeing through the delivery of preventative measures ‐ such as settings‐based interventions. However, research indicates the benefits derived from this ‘stand‐alone’ measure are inconclusive. It is argued that even the Whole School Approach needs to have a more robust underpinning to its framework. A cohesive, sustainable Model of Best Practice described here was discussed for its merits (and a limitation). Based on philosophical theories and concepts, including those of salutogenesis, social capital and the social model of health promotion, the vital integral components of the model include an emphasis on an all‐inclusive, positive School Culture and eliciting ‘the student voice’ on matters appertaining to students' own mental health needs. An opportunity existed recently to include ‘the student voice’ in a significant revision and remodelling of the RSHE (Relationships, Sex and Health Education) secondary school curriculum, made statutory in 2020. Several additional topics were included for public consultation, and although young people were asked their opinions on the items under review, the matter of the mandatory inclusion of ‘the student voice’ itself was not under consideration. The Department of Education is urged to reconsider this position.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Porous superhydrophobic (SHP) membranes are gaining considerable attention due to their excellent underwater absorption and drag reduction properties. They exploit the Cassie‒Baxter state of wetting to remove the bubble in a fast and reliable manner. Despite advancements in the understanding of droplets, the interaction of bubbles in such systems is not well understood. In the present study, we explore the impact dynamics of bubbles on a completely immersed porous SHP membrane. We focused on its bubble absorption capabilities under practically relevant variations in the impact angle and hydrostatic loading. Furthermore, wettability is also considered by exposing the material to oxygen plasma without changing the underlying physical structure. Concurrent with the fundamental investigation, we also propose a novel and efficient bubble absorption configuration using the same system. This scenario poses an inverse problem to the droplet spreading on solid surfaces with analogous implications and bear far‐reaching consequences in domains ranging from biomedical engineering to underwater collection of hydrocarbons.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT When output power from photovoltaic power generation system (PV system) to distribution system approaches the stability output limit, the power conditioning system (PCS) becomes uncontrollable. In this study, the stability output limit in the distribution system, where two PV systems are connected, were investigated. A numerical calculation method was developed to estimate the influence of the magnitude of output power and the connection location of PV systems on the stability output limit. It was assumed that a PV system (PV system1) is connected in the middle of the distribution line and the other one (PV system2) is connected to the end of that. In case that one PV system1 is con nected near the end of the distribution line, the stability output limit decreases with an increase in the output power. On the other hand, if the connection location of PV power1 is closer to a distribution substation, there are conditions under which the stability output limit increase with the output power. By calculating the stability output limit according to the actual the power distribution system conditions and setting the output power of PV system, it is possible to obtain the output power conditions for stable operation of PCS.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective This study was undertaken to evaluate whether synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) expression on peripheral immune cells predicts treatment response to levetiracetam in epilepsy. Methods High‐dimensional flow cytometry was used to prospectively assess SV2A expression on immune cells from levetiracetam responders, nonresponders, and healthy controls. SV2A expression levels were further validated using real‐time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‐qPCR) in an independent retrospective cohort. The predictive value of SV2A expression on naive CD8 + T cell‐specific SV2A/CD3 + median fluorescence intensity (MFI) ratio was determined, and correlations with central nervous system (CNS)‐resident cell expression were examined in the wild‐type (WT) C57BL6 mouse model. Results Naive CD8 + T cells showed significantly lower SV2A expression ( p = .0029) in nonresponders compared to responders, confirmed by RT‐qPCR ( p = .0022), with no difference in overall CD8 + T‐cell abundance. The naive CD8 + T cell‐specific SV2A/CD3 + MFI ratio (&gt;.4733) correctly identified most responders, with a positive predictive value of 81.8%. SV2A concentration was stable over time (mean interval = 121.2 days, 95% confidence interval = 93.64–148.7 days), unaffected by age, gender, dose, or treatment duration, and neuronal SV2A expression in the CNS of WT C57BL6 mice correlated with SV2A expression of CD8 + in circulating blood cells ( r = .655, p = .008). Significance Naive CD8+ T cell‐specific SV2A MFI ratio may represent a potential indicator of treatment response for levetiracetam. Pending further validation, its stability and accessibility suggest that it could potentially support treatment decisions and help to reduce ineffective drug trials.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In densely populated urban areas, the spread of fire between buildings is a significant risk. Many urban spaces have evolved with a preference for quick and cheap construction in deference to fire safety and adherence to any applicable local building regulations. With the increasing use of combustible and flammable materials inside and on our buildings, exacerbating the potential for building‐to‐building fire spread, it is therefore necessary to re‐evaluate the threat to the built environment due to this scenario. In order to address this research gap, computational fluid dynamics is implemented as a tool to simulate the behaviour of a fire and to determine the spatial evolution of the external temperature and heat flux away from the burning compartment's external openings under varied fuel load, fire growth rate and ventilation modes. It is shown that these outputs are a function of the heat release inside of the compartment as well as the internal ventilation conditions, with internal doors being closed increasing the intensity and extent of external conditions. This gives insight into factors which could lead to subsequent secondary ignition away from the compartment of origin. We also show that for a given heat release rate, the criteria for window breakage and therefore the time at which window breakage occurs is irrelevant to the ultimate magnitude and extent of the external conditions. These reflect essential considerations, necessary for ignition criteria of novel/new material consideration in the context of building‐to‐building fire spread in high density housing stock.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective We compared the reporting of patient and public involvement (PPI) in the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) with the guidance regarding PPI in the auspicing organisation's guideline development manual. Methods We examined the PPI guidance provided by seven guideline auspicing organisations from four countries, that provided guideline development manuals referencing PPI inclusion in guideline development. We determined whether the auspicing organisations provided guidance on four aspects of PPI critical to understanding the process; (i) which patients and public (PPs) to involve, (ii) how to recruit PPs, (iii) where in the process to involve PPs, and (iv) how PPs should contribute to guideline development. We assessed a random selection of 24 CPGs affiliated with these organisations for consistency of reporting of PPI with the guidance provided. Results Half (50%) of the auspicing organisations' guideline development manuals provided guidance on all four aspects of PPI. Five of the 24 CPGs (21%) affiliated with auspicing organisations that made reference to PPI in guideline development did not report PPI in their development. Although 79% (19/24) of guidelines did report PPI in their development, only half (10/19) reported PPI that was consistent with the auspicing organisations guidance. Conclusion Auspicing organisations often do not provide guidance to guideline developers on critical aspects of PPI. Even when auspicing organisations do provide guidance, CPG developers may not report PPI, and/or not report PPI consistent with that guidance. It is unknown whether this is because PPI was not conducted, or because it was conducted, but not reported, or was reported incompletely. Practice Implications Auspicing organisations need to improve guidance on PPI in guideline development, and CPG developers need to report PPI more diligently when it is done. Understanding guideline developers' motivations for PPI implementation and/or reporting is critical to facilitate improvement in this area.",

Introduction MND is a devasting neurodegenerative disease that has no cure and eventually leads to paralysis, progressive speech difficulties and respiratory failure. There are a plethora of interventions to support people living with MND, however, information regarding these interventions is often not organised in a manner that best supports the MND community. An evidence and gap map will provide a visual presentation that highlights the existing evidence that is available to support specific interventions, and indicate where there is no evidence. This will help inform future guideline and research efforts. Inclusion Criteria Studies if they describe care interventions for people living with MND, carers, asymptomatic genetic carriers, family, friends and healthcare professionals caring for people with MND. Peer‐reviewed randomised controlled trials, and nonrandomised studies of interventions, systematic reviews and qualitative studies describing the experience of an intervention will be included. Methods An evidence and gap map will be conducted according to Campbell guidance and JBI guidance for scoping reviews. A comprehensive search of academic databases and clinical trial registries will be performed to identify eligible studies. An evidence inclusion framework has been developed with members of the MND community. Data screening and extraction will be independently performed by two reviewers.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Distinct recurrence patterns of gastric cancer (GC) and Siewert II/III gastroesophageal junction cancer (GEJC) following curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy remain unclear. We aimed to investigate the initial recurrence patterns of GC/GEJC following curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. We retrospectively analyzed recurrence sites and timing in 1255 patients with GC/GEJC (338 with GEJC; 917 with GC) treated with curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy (2011–2018). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify predictors of recurrence patterns. Of the 430 patients who experienced recurrence, complete data were available for 352 (124 with GEJC; 228 with GC). In GEJC, distant recurrence was predominant (47.6%), followed by multifocal (22.6%), peritoneal (15.3%), and locoregional (14.5%) recurrence. Peritoneal metastases occurred primarily within four postoperative years, with two late exceptions. In GC, multifocal recurrence was the most frequent (36.8%), followed by distant (29.8%), peritoneal (26.8%), and locoregional (6.6%) recurrence. A notable proportion of patients with GC developed peritoneal and distant metastases annually after surgery, even beyond 5 years postoperatively. Most recurrences occurred within 3 years (81.5% GEJC; 77.2% GC). Multivariate analysis identified GEJC as an independent risk factor for locoregional (hazard ratio [HR], 1.953; p = .008) and distant recurrences (HR, 1.618; p = .004). Recurrence patterns after curative resection and adjuvant chemotherapy vary significantly between patients with GEJC and those with GC, and surveillance strategies should be tailored according to their respective characteristics. Intensive follow‐up within the first 3 years is recommended for patients with GC/GEJC.",

Methods This prospective, single‐surgeon cohort study included women with SUI who underwent TVT or TOT at a single center (July 2021–October 2022). Follow‐up was conducted at 26–41 months through chart review and patient interviews. Satisfaction was rated on a 0–100% global scale (≥75% = satisfied). Outcomes and complications followed International Continence Society criteria. Continuous variables were compared with the Mann–Whitney U ‐test and categorical variables with Fisher's exact test. Sensitivity analysis addressed the effects of loss to follow‐up. Statistical significance was set at P &lt; 0.05. Results Fifty‐three women (25 TVT, 28 TOT) completed follow‐up. Satisfaction (≥75%) was reported by 88.0% of TVT and 89.3% of TOT patients ( P ≈ 1.00). Sensitivity analyses assuming all lost patients were satisfied or unsatisfied did not alter statistical significance ( P ≈ 1.00 and P = 0.54, respectively). Among women with pre‐existing overactive bladder, improvement in symptoms occurred in 78.3% (18/23) of TVT and 61.1% (11/18) of TOT patients ( P = 0.47). One bladder perforation occurred in the TVT group; other complications were infrequent and similar between groups. Conclusions Both TVT and TOT provided high satisfaction and improvement in OAB symptoms at 26–41 months, with low complication rates. These findings suggest that both procedures remain safe and effective in the medium term, reinforcing their established role in the surgical management of SUI.",

Mianzi (“面子” in Chinese) is an indigenous concept related to the social perception of one's prestige or admiration. The goal of this 2‐year longitudinal study was to examine the moderating role of social preference in the relations between self‐reported concern for mianzi and adjustment in Chinese adolescents. Methods Participants in this study included junior high school students ( N = 938; 461 boys) initially in seventh grade ( M age = 12.41 years) in urban and rural areas of China. Students completed a self‐report measure of concern for mianzi, peer assessments of social preference, prosociality, and aggression. Head teachers in each classroom rated each student in the class on their behavioral problems and learning problems. Results &amp; Conclusions Adolescents' concern for mianzi was found to negatively predict later aggression, behavioral problems, and learning problems for students who had high initial social preference. Concern for mianzi also positively predicted later aggression for students, particularly boys, who had low initial social preference. The results suggested that concern for mianzi might be a sensitivity factor in adolescents' social‐behavioral and school adjustment and highlighted the role of context in shaping the relations.",

This study aimed to analyze the status and dynamics of pediatric dental education using bibliometric methods. Methods Publications from 1988 to 2024 were searched in the PubMed database. Two investigators screened and identified articles for further study based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. VOSviewer and CiteSpace were used to analyze and visualize the bibliometric networks. Results A total of 342 articles were included in the bibliometric analysis. The United States published the largest number of articles. The Journal of Dental Education ( n = 85), Pediatric Dentistry ( n = 74), and European Journal of Dental Education ( n = 25) were the top three journals according to the number of publications. Most literature focused on the postgraduate education (47.66%) and undergraduate education (30.99%) in pediatric dental education. The two most repeatedly used keywords were “pediatric dentistry” and “dental education.” Research hot topics in the field of pediatric dental education have focused on “competency‐based education,” “clinical education,” and “advanced dental education.” Conclusion Based on bibliometric mapping from 1988 to 2024, this study provides a relatively comprehensive overview of the global landscape of pediatric dental education, highlighting publication trends, influential contributors, and evolving research themes. The analysis reveals the research hotspots of pediatric dental education focused on competency‐based education, clinical training, and advanced dental education, reflecting the discipline's movement toward more diversified and technology‐enhanced teaching models.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Soil salinity is a major abiotic stress limiting crop productivity, particularly for glycophytic species such as sage ( Salvia officinalis L.), a medicinal plant of high pharmacological and economic importance. Conventional tolerance mechanisms in sage, including proline accumulation and osmotic adjustment, are energetically costly and insufficient under severe stress. This study investigated the potential of co‐cultivation with Aptenia cordifolia and Spergularia salina to enhance sage growth, physiology, and survival under controlled sodium chloride (NaCl) stress. Results Glasshouse experiments were conducted with sage in monoculture and in co‐culture with halophytes under four salinity levels (0, 2, 5, and 10 g/L NaCl). Morphological, physiological, and biochemical analyses revealed that salinity reduced growth, biomass, and water content, while increasing proline and sugar accumulation. Co‐cultivation significantly improved plant performance: survival at 10 g/L NaCl was 30% in monoculture but rose to 90% with A. cordifolia and 85% with Spergularia salina . Co‐culture also mitigated proline overaccumulation (710% increase in monoculture versus 471.6% and 386.7% in association with A. cordifolia and Spergularia salina , respectively). Principal component analysis and robust regression confirmed that halophytes buffered stress effects, with Spergularia salina providing the most stable improvements. Machine learning analyses further identified biomass and sugar content as key discriminant traits between treatments. Conclusion These findings demonstrate that companion planting with halophytes enhances the tolerance of Salvia officinalis to salt stress by reducing physiological costs and improving survival. This approach represents a sustainable and scalable agroecological strategy for cultivating medicinal plants in saline environments, with implications for resilient agriculture under climate change. © 2026 Society of Chemical Industry.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Lebrikizumab is approved to treat patients with moderate‐to‐severe atopic dermatitis (AD). Objectives This study evaluated the 16‐week efficacy outcomes of lebrikizumab in adults and adolescents with severe AD in ADvocate trials who would be eligible for treatment based on South Korean reimbursement‐like criteria. Methods This was a post‐hoc analysis of pooled data from ADvocate1 (NCT04146363) and ADvocate2 (NCT04178967). Patients were randomised 2:1 to receive lebrikizumab or placebo every 2 weeks. Two non‐mutually exclusive subgroups were selected based on South Korean reimbursement‐like criteria: Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) score ≥ 23, AD duration ≥ 3 years, and previous use of any systemic treatment (ST subgroup) or previous treatment with cyclosporine or methotrexate (CM subgroup). Week‐16 outcomes were Investigator's Global Assessment score of 0 or 1 (IGA [0,1]) with ≥ 2‐point improvement, ≥ 50%/75%/90% improvement in EASI score (EASI 50/75/90), Pruritus Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ≥ 4‐point improvement, and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) ≥ 4‐point improvement. Response rates to lebrikizumab and placebo were analysed using Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel tests. Common risk differences and 95% confidence intervals were reported. Results The ST subgroup included 322 patients, and the CM subgroup included 111 patients. More lebrikizumab‐treated than placebo‐treated patients achieved outcome responses. Percentage differences in favour of lebrikizumab ( p &lt; 0.01) were: IGA (0,1): ST = 25.7% (18.2%–33.1%), CM = 20.8% (7.9%–33.7%); EASI 50: ST = 42.7% (32.5%–52.9%), CM = 36.9% (19.8%–54.0%); EASI 75: ST = 40.2% (31.4%–49.1%), CM = 33.3% (19.1%–47.5%); EASI 90: ST = 27.4% (20.3%–34.5%), CM = 22.1% (11.3%–32.8%); Pruritus NRS ≥ 4‐point improvement: ST = 34.7% (26.7%–42.7%), CM = 26.7% (14.9%–38.4%); and DLQI ≥ 4‐point improvement: ST = 44.2% (33.2%–55.2%), CM = 39.5% (20.2%–58.8%). Conclusions In this post‐hoc, exploratory subgroup analysis, lebrikizumab improved AD skin and pruritus at week 16 in adults and adolescents who would be eligible for treatment based on South Korean reimbursement‐like criteria.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective There is no consensus on blood thinner management in the perioperative period for head and neck free flap reconstructions. This study evaluated head and neck free flap outcomes in patients on baseline blood thinners, aspirin flap prophylaxis, and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis regimens. Methods Patients undergoing head and neck free flap reconstruction at a single tertiary, academic institution were included. Patients were grouped according to baseline blood thinners, aspirin flap prophylaxis, and DVT prophylaxis regimens. The primary outcome was overall complication rate, while secondary outcomes included flap compromise, flap failure, bleeding, venous thrombotic events, and arterial thrombotic events. Statistical analysis was performed with Fisher's exact test and risk ratio (RR) regression analysis, using propensity score‐adjusted models. Results Of 470 patients, 16.6% experienced postoperative complications. Longer preoperative holds (odds ratio [OR] = 1.81, p = 0.04) and delayed resumption of baseline blood thinners (OR = 1.56, p = 0.04) were associated with increased complication risk, particularly flap compromise. Unfractionated heparin was associated with higher complication rates compared to sequential compression devices (RR = 3.10, p = 0.018) and low molecular weight heparin (RR = 2.79, p &lt; 0.001) for DVT prophylaxis. No other perioperative blood thinner regimens were significantly associated with postoperative complications. Conclusions Most regimens, including baseline blood thinners, aspirin flap prophylaxis, and DVT prophylaxis, can be managed safely in the perioperative period. However, unfractionated heparin was associated with higher complication rates than other DVT prophylaxis regimens. While baseline blood thinners did not increase most complications, prolonged preoperative holding and delayed resumption may jeopardize flap viability—highlighting a modifiable point of intervention.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Limited exciton utilization efficiency—primarily due to spin‐forbidden triplet transitions—remains a fundamental challenge in organic optoelectronics. Unlike conventional closed‐shell luminophores, open‐shell diradicaloids inherently overcome this limitation by enabling spin‐allowed emission from both singlet and triplet excited states. However, achieving high luminescence efficiency in diradicaloids remains challenging due to competing nonradiative decay pathways and structural instability. Herein, we report a super‐stable and highly luminescent Müller‐type diradicaloid, TPT‐CzPh, which achieves a record photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 16.9%—an order‐of‐magnitude improvement over the prototypical Müller hydrocarbon TTM‐PhTTM. Comprehensive spectroscopic and theoretical analyses attribute the enhanced emission to a rationally engineered donor–acceptor framework that enables efficient spin‐allowed transitions and suppresses nonradiative decay via minimized structural reorganization. Remarkably, TPT‐CzPh also exhibits pronounced X‐ray‐induced scintillation, representing the first luminescent diradicaloid functioning as a metal‐free organic scintillator. This dual achievement not only deepens understanding of excited‐state dynamics in diradicaloids but also bridges open‐shell photophysics with radiation detection, paving the way for next‐generation high‐efficiency optoelectronic materials.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Topological photonics has emerged as a transformative paradigm for terahertz (THz) science and technology, offering unprecedented control over electromagnetic waves through modes that are inherently robust against disorder, defects, and fabrication imperfections. 3D topological insulators (TIs), characterized by spin‑polarized Dirac surface states, provide a powerful materials platform for realizing tunable, low‑loss THz components with functionalities that surpass those of conventional photonic systems. Operating across a spectral range central to next‑generation imaging, sensing, and high‑capacity wireless communications, TI‑based devices promise enhanced performance, stability, and energy efficiency. This paper covers recent advances in THz photonic devices and circuits enabled by TIs and topological design principles. We first outline the fundamental electronic and optical properties of 3D TIs and evaluate their integration into THz modulators, switches, detectors, and emitters. We then discuss the progression from traditional TI‑based photonics to fully topological photonic platforms, highlighting the emergence of structures that support unidirectional, backscattering‑immune light transport. Finally, we examine how advanced topological phases, including quantum spin Hall, quantum valley Hall, and higher‑order topologies, unlock defect‑immune propagation, reflectionless interfaces, and reconfigurable THz circuitry. Together, these developments position topological photonic materials and architectures as a foundational technology for scalable, resilient, and high‑performance THz and quantum photonic systems.",

    "Abstract": "Russeting is one of the most important horticultural problemsin apple production worldwide. Fruit cultivars differ generally in their susceptibility to russet. Apple variety “Red Velox” lately introduced in Himachal Pradesh is very prone to russeting. Hence, an experiment was conducted during 2021–2022 at Regional Horticultural Research and Training Station, Mashobra, Shimla, to investigate the effect of different concentrations and timings of gibberellins A 4 and A 7 (GA 4 + 7 ) + 6‐benzyladenine (BA) application on russet control and quality of “Red Velox” apple. Minimum russet formation on skin surface of apple (1.21%) was observed when GA 4 + 7 + BA at 10 ppm were sprayed at full bloom and petal fall stage. Physical parameters, viz., fruit weight (193.00g), fruit size in terms of length and breadth (66.88 mm × 73.20 mm) and fruit volume (385.33 cc), fruit firmness (9.10 kg cm −3 ), and total sugar (10.13%), were recorded maximum with three sprays of GA 4 + 7 + BA at 10 ppm at petal fall and later at 10‐day intervals. Fruit shape index (0.96) was recorded maximum in plants treated with GA 4 + 7 + BA at 25 ppm at petal fall and full bloom stage. However, titratable acidity (0.42%) was maximum with two sprays of GA 4 + 7 + BA at 1 ppm at petal fall and later at 10‐day interval. Ascorbic acid content (6.33 mg/100g) was maximum in plants treated with three sprays of GA 4 + 7 + BA at 2.5 ppm at petal fall and later at 10‐day interval. Thus, a targeted plant growth regulators regime robustly suppresses russet and elevates overall fruit quality in this russet‐susceptible cultivar “Red Velox.”",

    "Abstract": "The purpose of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of the phytochemical composition, nutritional value, and health benefits of edible flowers in the Asian region. Edible flowers have been highly valued in traditional medicine and cuisine in Asia for centuries. They are rich in macronutrients, micronutrients, and phytochemicals such as flavonoids, phenolic acids, and carotenoids, which confer the anti‐inflammatory, anti‐oxidant, and cardiovascular effects. These properties contribute to the prevention of chronic diseases by reducing oxidative stress, managing inflammation, and supporting cardiovascular functions. This review highlights the importance of these properties, supporting the application of edible flowers in functional foods and dietary supplements. It further evaluates the safety and the potential toxicity of edible flower consumption and the innovative approach of using edible flowers in the green synthesis of nanoparticles. The results of this study suggest that edible flowers are a promising plant‐based alternative to synthetic food additives. However, further studies and guidelines are required to ensure safe consumption and facilitate commercial applications. Overall, this study bridges the traditional knowledge and the modern science, highlighting the potential of Asian edible flowers to contribute to plant‐based innovations, public health, and sustainable food systems for broader societal benefits.",

    "Abstract": "A study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of greenhouse whitefly, Trialeurodesvaporariorum (Westwood), and its parasitoids ( Encarsia formosa Gahan and E. sophia Girault &amp; Dodd) on cucumber crops in Himachal Pradesh, India, during April–July of 2022 and 2023. The research aimed to understand colonization patterns of greenhouse whitefly invasion due to protected cultivation expansion and climate change. In 2022, greenhouse whitefly populations emerged in the 19th standard meterological week (SMW) (0.36 nymphs/leaf), peaking at 57.47 nymphs/plant in the 28th week. The 2023 season showed higher infestation levels, with initial detection in week 21 (1.02 nymphs/leaf) and peak density of 127.76 nymphs/leaf in week 30. The parasitoid E. formosa appeared in week 21 (2022) and week 23 (2023), reaching peak parasitism of 19.04 and 19.23 nymphs/plant, respectively. Similarly, E. sophia emerged later, showing peak parasitism of 11.34 nymphs/plant (week 29, 2022) and 6.85 nymphs/plant (week 32, 2023). Optimal sampling analysis revealed an inverse relationship between pest density and required sample size, with low densities requiring ≈584 samples to achieve 10% precision. The findings of this investigation provide valuable empirical data for establishing an efficient sampling protocol for T. vaporariorum and its associated parasitoids, E. formosa and E. sophia , in cucumber cultivation systems.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the essential oil (EO) content, composition, and antibacterial activity of different plant parts of palmarosa cultivated under unexplored mid‐hill conditions of the Western Himalayas. EO was extracted by hydrodistillation and analyzed using GC and GC–MS, identifying geraniol (82.5%–85.0%), neryl acetate (8.4%–9.8%), cis‐β ‐terpineol (1.48%–2.06%), linalool&lt;dehydro&gt; (0.82%–1.6%), and caryophyllene (0.23%–0.70%) as chemical constituents, together accounting for 98.43%–99.60% of the total composition. Geraniol was most abundant in the whole plant (82.53%–88.13%), followed by leaves (80.26%–86.78%) and inflorescences (80.23%–83.77%). The EO exhibited strong antibacterial activity against both gram‐positive ( Micrococcus luteus , Bacillus subtilis , Staphylococcus aureus ) and gram‐negative ( Klebsiella pneumoniae , Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa ) strains. Inflorescence oil produced the largest inhibition zone (19.66 ± 0.47 mm, B. subtilis ) and the smallest (5.66 ± 0.47 mm, K. pneumoniae ). Minimum inhibitory concentrations ranged from 2.0% to 0.125% (v/v), with inflorescence oil showing the greatest potency (0.125% for five strains). The antibacterial activity is attributed to the synergistic action of major and minor constituents. This study addresses a knowledge gap by analyzing EO yield and composition across palmarosa plant parts and demonstrating antibacterial efficacy in the mid‐hills of the Western Himalayan region.",

    "Abstract": "In vitro techniques help speed propagation and preservation of elite cultivars. To improve the efficiency of in vitro culture initiation of kiwifruit plants, we have investigated the influence of the nodal explant position on the donor plant and explant source. Field‐grown and indoor‐grown cane materials from Actinidia chinensis var. deliciosa ‘Hayward’ and A. chinensis var. chinensis ‘Zesy002’ were used. A total of 1106 nodal explants were used in this study. Explants proximal to the apical shoot bud were more likely to result in successful culture initiation than those from distal positions. The effect of lateral shoot position along the cane on culture initiation was generally smaller than effects relating to nodal position on the lateral shoots, the source of the nodal explants (indoor dormant cane vs. outdoor actively growing cane) and cultivar. Plant material sprouted indoors from dormant cane cuttings showed less microbial growth than explants obtained from field‐grown material in active growth. This study reveals that the success of in vitro culture initiation declined with increasing distance of explants from the lateral shoot apical bud. These results may be of use for in vitro culture initiation of other species in the genus Actinida and other clonal woody plants.",

    "Abstract": "Postharvest black rot caused by Alternaria alternata significantly reduces tomato shelf‐life worldwide. This study assessed the efficacy of p ‐coumaric acid and the ethanolic extract of Trichoderma longibrachiatum (Ext14) on the growth of A. alternata under in vitro conditions and in tomato fruits and explored the compound's mode of action against the pathogen. Spores were exposed to p ‐coumaric acid (0.5–2 mg.mL −1 ) for 48 h to measure the in vitro inhibition of spore germination. Tomatoes were treated, with Ext14 and p ‐coumaric acid (1.5–6 mg.mL −1 ), inoculated with A. alternata and maintained at 25°C and 80%–90% relative humidity (R.H.) to determine the in vivo antifungal effect of treatments. Alternaria's spore membrane integrity was evaluated by fluorescence microscopy, and molecular docking explored p ‐coumaric acid binding to succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). P‐ coumaric acid maintained 100% inhibition of spore germination at 1.5–2 mg.mL −1 throughout 48 h. On fruit, Ext14 reduced lesion diameter by 61% at 96 h, surpassing p ‐coumaric acid treatment at a concentration of 6 mg.mL −1 , which delayed disease only to 72 h ( p ≤ 0.05). Fluorescence imaging showed a spore membrane disruption in p ‐coumaric acid treated spores. Docking positioned p ‐coumaric acid in the ubiquinone (UQ) pocket of SDH, stabilized by two hydrogen bonds (Asn281, Tyr628) and π‐alkyl contacts, with a binding energy of −5.0 kcal.mol −1 versus −4.7 kcal.mol −1 for UQ. These findings indicate that p ‐coumaric acid inhibits the spore germination of A. alternata and plays an antifungal role by disrupting cell membranes and possibly competes for the SDH active site. These results suggest potential application of P ‐coumaric acid in ecofriendly postharvest protection.",

Results Three hundred and thirty‐one devices were inserted into 311 patients. Median patient age was 0.7 years (IQR 0.15–1.27) and median weight 7.8 kg (4.8–10.6). Median CVC dwell time was 13 (IQR 9.2–18.2) days. The success rate in completing prescribed treatment with the device was 94.9%, with 17 failures. Thirteen failures were due to accidental dislodgement (3.9% of all comers, 77% of failures). A large majority (79%) of patients received outpatient antibiotic therapy. Patients with any history of previous CVC insertion were more likely to have failed devices. All neonatal patient devices successfully completed treatment.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Urban areas are increasingly valued for their role in conserving wild pollinators. Honeybees are often regarded as ambassador species for pollinator conservation, and beekeeping is frequently perceived as a pro‐biodiversity activity, which has become highly popular in urban areas. However, the rapid increase in documented urban honeybee populations raises concerns about potential competition for resources and disease spillover into wild bee populations. This calls for better regulation and management of urban beekeeping. Drawing on previous studies, we present and discuss six critical social‐ecological aspects of urban beekeeping, specifically, (1) the rapid growth of urban beekeeping, (2) asymmetries in the distribution of honeybee hives across beekeepers, (3) disrupted thermal balances, (4) knowledge and perceptions on urban floral resources, (5) competition for floral resources and (6) health management and disease transmission. We then discuss pathways towards a social‐ecological regulation of urban beekeeping. We advocate developing an urban bee management concept as a tool for establishing contextualized and equitable policies that work across urban land‐use gradients. Such a concept can support the management of urban landscapes for mixed uses, including biodiversity conservation and agricultural production, including beekeeping. However, this concept must emerge from co‐design and co‐creation processes involving all stakeholders, including beekeepers and conservationists, thereby integrating diverse views and preventing confrontation. In doing so, cities can better design, manage, and plan their landscapes to support all pollinators. Read the free Plain Language Summary for this article on the Journal blog.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The integration of photothermal conversion and long‐afterglow luminescence into a single textile platform presents a promising strategy for developing intelligent outdoor apparel, but depending on the properties of different functional materials, the preparation of multifunctional coatings with luminescent, and thermal effects remains challenging. Herein, a hierarchical functionalization approach to fabricate a photothermal‐luminescent fabric was developed. A polydopamine (PDA) layer was first deposited onto nylon taffeta via in situ polymerization to serve as an efficient photothermal conversion layer and a versatile adhesive interface. Subsequently, a waterborne polyurethane (WPU) coating containing SiO 2 /KH570 co‐encapsulated SAO phosphors was applied to impart long‐afterglow luminescence. The resulting composite fabric (SAO‐PDA‐PU) exhibits a remarkable equilibrium temperature of 60.3°C under 1000 W/m 2 illumination, significantly outperforming the original fabric (43.3°C). The SiO 2 encapsulation layer effectively shields SAO from moisture, ensuring excellent and stable green afterglow emission even in humid environments. Furthermore, the fabric demonstrates superior practicality for outdoor use, possessing excellent hydrophobicity (with a water contact angle ~114°), high hydrostatic pressure resistance of ~5 kPa, and efficient self‐cleaning capability. This work provides a viable and efficient pathway for designing next‐generation multifunctional textiles for applications in personal thermal management and nighttime safety protection.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The viscosity and elasticity of water‐soluble polymers are critical in the petroleum industry, particularly under high‐temperature and high‐salinity conditions. In this study, a multi‐armed hydrazide‐POSS (HPOSS) and a carbonyl‐functionalized hydrophobic association polymer (CFHAP) were developed to create dual networks (CFHAP/HPOSS). Unlike conventional binary cross‐linkers, HPOSS promoted the formation of dense and stable covalent cross‐linked structures. Even at low concentrations of both CFHAP and HPOSS, CFHAP/HPOSS exhibited robust network formation with exceptional thickening properties, achieving a significantly higher viscosity of 3927 mPa·s at 2 g/L compared to the polymer's 410 mPa s and the binary cross‐linking system's 2453 mPa s. Under a 40 g/L Na + solution, CFHAP/HPOSS exhibited salt responsiveness by enhancing their hydrophobic network, resulting in a viscosity of 5325 mPa s and a modulus G′ &gt; G″. These enhanced rheological properties were further utilized to improve aqueous foam stability. The results revealed improved foam stability with an extended half‐life time (8248 s), low drainage rate (0.0064 g/s maximum), and minimal bubble size distribution variation. SEM images also reveal a fully formed polymer film network, which effectively inhibits foam drainage and coarsening. Our strategy provides valuable insights into developing new materials with adjustable thickening and elastic properties.",

The composite shows 2.21 Ω cm resistivity through conductive filler interactions. EMI shielding in X‐band reveals 80.57 dB total shielding effectiveness, exceeding individual components (PPy/PDMS: 43.54 dB; MXene/PVA: 5.62 dB).

Compared to the neat PI matrix, the dielectric constant of the composites was significantly increased with filler incorporation. The optimal PI/PIC composite films achieved a dielectric constant of 175 with a concurrent low dielectric loss of 0.098 at 1 MHz. Moreover, these composites exhibited a high breakdown strength (&gt; 0.48 V/μm), outstanding thermal stability ( T 10% &gt; 550°C), and a tensile strength exceeding 125.4 MPa.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Bisphosphonic acid groups are emerging as promising functionalities for actinide decontamination, due to their high density of chelating sites. However, the chemistry of bisphosphonate (in particular alendronate) materials remains complex and underexplored. Herein, the synthesis of novel valuable materials, namely poly( N ‐isopropylacrylamide)‐ b ‐poly(acryloylmorpholine‐ co ‐alendronate acrylamide) (PNIPAAm‐ b ‐P(NAM‐ co ‐AleAAm)) was reported. These copolymers were synthesized in three steps. First, poly( N ‐isopropylacrylamide)‐ b ‐poly(acryloylmorpholine‐ co ‐ N ‐acryloxysuccinimide) (PNIPAAm‐ b ‐P(NAM‐ co ‐NAS)) diblock copolymers were prepared by RAFT polymerization. Then, bisphosphonic acid groups were grafted onto the preformed copolymers by a post‐polymerization modification reaction. Original produced alendronate‐based functional copolymers were either water‐soluble or capable of forming hydrogels under suitable concentration and temperature conditions. Sorption properties of such materials for actinides were investigated. For such purpose, the binding affinities of these functionalized copolymers for actinide surrogates, Nd(III) and Ce(III), were evaluated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Experimental results demonstrated good complexation efficiency, which logically raised with increasing bisphosphonic acid content. These results highlight the potential of well‐defined, tunable hydrosoluble/hydrogel bisphosphonate‐based polymers as high potential candidates for actinide decorporation applications.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Due to the presence of additives and mattifying pigments, the use of opaque PET bottles for the packaging of UHT milk was a challenge in terms of recycling. To overcome this limit, a new bottle made from opaque 50% recycled PET (rPET) has been recently introduced on the market by an important food company after the adoption of a closed‐loop recycling. Aim of this study is then to compare the environmental impact of it with a 100% virgin opaque PET bottle by considering a closed‐loop and a non‐closed‐loop recycling of the letter. To this purpose, a life cycle assessment (LCA) has been carried out through the Simapro software, with a cradle‐to‐grave approach. Primary data were retrieved from a leading dairy company, whereas secondary data were retrieved from the Ecoinvent database 3.10 and national consortia. The opaque 50% rPET bottle, compared to traditional ones, presented environmental advantages in 17 of the 27 impact categories considered in the EN 15804 + A2 methodology, with a 30% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and significant improvements in ozone depletion and resource use. This study is the first LCA related to recycled opaque PET bottles, and the results demonstrate how they can be considered, thanks to closed‐loop recycling, a more sustainable packaging alternative for UHT milk. These findings highlight the environmental benefits of rPET and its relevance for sustainable packaging strategies in the dairy sector.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Data assimilation of in‐situ aircraft measurements has greatly benefited numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecast accuracy for decades. Recently, meteorological observations of wind and air temperature have been derived from Mode‐Selective Enhanced Surveillance (Mode‐S) aircraft reports which are used to meet air traffic and navigation requirements. The typical temporal resolution can be approximately 4 s or less per aircraft, compared to approximately seven minutes for aircraft meteorological data relay (AMDAR), with similar errors. Here, three months of European Mode‐S estimates of wind and air temperature were assimilated into the Met Office global deterministic Unified Model, to determine their impact on forecast skill. Their assimilation reduced root‐mean‐squared error (RMSE) of forecasted winds, geopotential height and temperature between 850 and 250 hPa in Europe to T + 48 and in the Northern Hemisphere to T + 96. Trials showed that wind observations provided most benefit, and that results were relatively insensitive to horizontal thinning distance. However, given the high observation density, using a coarser horizontal thinning distance of 120 km allowed independent observations to retain their impact while still benefiting from Mode‐S information. The Mode‐S input error profile can be adjusted to potentially improve the average benefit of Mode‐S. However, careful choice of thinning settings should be considered, to prevent oversaturation of Mode‐S observations and inadvertently worsening forecast skill. For the first time ever, observations from a groundbreaking global Mode‐S network were also assimilated into an NWP model. This dataset includes valuable observations from traditionally under‐observed regions such as Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. The impact on overall forecast skill was considerable, with the global Mode‐S data contributing more significantly to improvements than the European dataset, thanks to its more comprehensive global coverage. The global Mode‐S network is poised to become an indispensable source of data for operational centres worldwide, with great potential to improve both regional and global future forecasts.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Tiger ( Panthera tigris ) attacks are a frequent source of injuries and fatalities among villagers in Nepal, where many communities make extensive use of dense forests for foraging and grazing of livestock. As conservation efforts have boosted the tiger population in the country, a conflict exists between maintaining traditional practises whilst ensuring human safety and protecting endangered predators. Hence, there is a need for cost‐effective management strategies that do not reduce habitat use by humans or wildlife. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) offers a promising approach to mapping tiger presence in real‐time and providing a warning system for villagers. Although tigers vocalize infrequently, their presence triggers alarm calls from prey species, meaning these alarm calls could potentially act as a proxy for detecting tigers. To explore the potential for tracking tigers and other dangerous predators such as leopards using these alarm calls, we designed and tested a PAM system in the Terai region of southern Nepal. We implemented a TinyML low‐memory convolutional neural network (~1000 parameters) for chital deer ( Axis axis ) automatic detection—a species that reliably produce loud predator‐specific alarm calls—and deployed a distributed network of 10 autonomous interconnected sensors for continuous operation over 3 months. The network transmits chital deer alarm call events via a cellular‐connected gateway to a remote base station to generate a heatmap of predator risk. Incidences of high predator risk can be used to alert local forest rangers, who can then inform nearby villagers of areas with a higher likelihood of predator presence. The neural net achieved an F1 score of 0.91 in training and 0.72 in the field. We suggest that this proof of concept indicates that automated PAM could be an effective tool for detecting and tracking tigers and other predators and a potentially valuable tool for facilitating human‐wildlife co‐existence.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper examines the specifics of ecological sustainability, using the measure of the load capacity factor (LCF), over the Next Eleven (N‐11) nations between 1990 and 2022. The main explanatory variables are renewable energy consumption (RNW), information and communication technology (ICT), GDP growth and GDP growth squared (GDP, GDP 2 ), environmental‐related taxation (ENT), financial development (FD), and the interaction of GDP and ICT, and GDP and ENT. The analysis applies fixed effects regression with Driscoll–Kraay standard errors and quantile regression to account for heterogeneity, cross‐sectional dependence, and distributional effects. Framed within the sustainability paradox, the notion that economic and technological progress can both advance and degrade ecological outcomes, the results reveal significant heterogeneity. ENT exhibits a robust positive association with LCF across most specifications, supporting sustainability goals. RNW demonstrates a positive and significant impact at lower quantiles, suggesting benefits in countries with weaker ecological performance, but turns negative and significant at higher quantiles, indicating diminishing returns or potential trade‐offs in more sustainable economies. In contrast, ICT and FD exert negative effects at higher quantiles, indicating that without environmental safeguards, digitalization and financial expansion may intensify ecological pressures. These findings underscore the need for integrated, context‐specific policies that balance development with ecological resilience. The study offers critical insights for aligning national strategies in the N‐11 with global sustainability goals, particularly SDGs 7, 9, 12, and 13.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This study investigates stakeholder perspectives on mobilising private‐sector finance for climate adaptation in Southeast Asia, emphasising Hong Kong's role as a financial intermediary. Through semi‐structured interviews with diverse stakeholders, including practitioners, policymakers, insurers, and project developers, we employed a grounded theory approach to identify key themes. The findings reveal significant opportunities for private capital across five adaptation domains: flood resilience, energy resilience, early warning systems, digital infrastructure resilience, and insurance coverage. However, stakeholders also identified barriers, such as fragmented project pipelines, the public‐good nature of adaptation initiatives, and challenges in quantifying adaptation risks. To overcome these obstacles, participants advocated for a Hong Kong‐based Adaptation Aggregation Facility, developing blended‐finance instruments, and introducing an adaptation taxonomy with disclosure protocols to enhance local capacity. Policy implications highlight the need for seed capital, credit enhancements, tax incentives, and regulatory sandboxes to attract private investment. This study provides actionable insights for scaling private adaptation finance and underscores priorities for further interdisciplinary and practice‐oriented research.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This research is dedicated to improving the efficacy and durability of graphdiyne (GDY), a novel 2D carbon allotrope, for applications in photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Addressing issues such as the relatively poor stability of GDY in practical applications, we innovatively employed a high‐entropy oxide (HEO) to replace conventional copper substrates, successfully preparing an HEO‐GDY composite. This was further integrated with Zn 0.5 Cd 0.5 S to construct the ZHG‐10 photocatalyst. Experimental results demonstrate that ZHG‐10 exhibits superior photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity and cycling stability in comparison to GDY‐based catalysts synthesized from Cu or Cu 2+ precursors, achieving a hydrogen production rate of up to 7.59 mmol/g/h. Photoelectrochemical tests reveal that the multi‐element chemical environment of HEO significantly enhances the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that the multi‐metal synergy and lattice distortion effects in HEO introduce numerous defective active sites (e.g., oxygen vacancies), which not only serve as efficient centers for hydrogen adsorption and activation but also significantly optimize interfacial charge transfer pathways. This study elucidates the dual functionality of HEO‐GDY in enhancing charge carrier separation and providing abundant active sites, offering a new strategy for developing high‐performance and durable GDY‐based photocatalytic systems.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The architecture of graphene stacks has a profound effect on their performance in a broad range of applications, including energy storage or catalysis. Despite its high demand, the identification of a material synthesis/processing method that combines structure tunability with high product quality and quantity remains challenging. Here, this long‐standing challenge is addressed through the electrochemical unzipping of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in a molten salt. Contrary to the established chemical oxidation approach for CNT unzipping, the proposed electrochemical process retains an oxygen‐free surface and eradicates graphene's structural defects. Moreover, the temperature of the melt determines the architecture of restacked graphene sheets, which transition from few‐layered turbostratic to multilayered Bernal‐type stacking. While this tunable graphitic structure is herein correlated with its Li‐ion battery fast‐charging performance, the implications of electrochemical unzipping of CNTs in molten CaCl 2 ‐NaCl are far‐reaching, opening up avenues for numerous applications that rely on graphene‐like and graphitic structures.",

A 12 nm‐thick freestanding MoSiN membrane with lateral dimensions of 10 mm × 10 mm was fabricated with a supporting frame. Reducing the membrane thickness lowers thermal mass, minimizing power consumption and enabling faster heating and cooling for enhanced thermal response. Structural analysis reveals a unique microstructure comprising intermetallic phases (Mo 5 Si 3 , MoSi 2 ) that coexist with an oxygen‐diffused silicon nitride dielectric phase. The intermetallic phases provide free carriers for mid‐infrared absorption, while the dielectric phase enhances mechanical stability and thermal endurance. The membrane exhibits metal‐like emissivity (0.41) and maintains structural integrity up to 900°C. Repeated thermal cycling under pulsed heating demonstrates excellent temperature control, high repeatability, and rapid radiative cooling, confirming its suitability for high‐temperature sensing. This combination of structural, optical, and thermal attributes positions MoSiN membranes as promising candidates for next‐generation gas Microheater, emissivity, free carrier absorption, freestanding membrane, mid infrareddetection technologies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Electrochemical CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) in neutral or alkaline environment suffers from carbonate formation, leading to low CO 2 utilization. Acidic operation can mitigate this issue, but is hampered by the dominant hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, we report a cavitated carbon particle (CCP)–supported Au catalyst featuring abundant inner cavities that sustain elevated local alkalinity. These cavities could be formed by inducing interfacial instability in block copolymer particles. A solid carbon particle (SCP)‐supported Au catalyst, which does not possess any cavities, was also synthesized, and the effect of the cavity for the CO 2 RR was evaluated in 5 wt.% Au/CCP and Au/SCP catalysts at pH 2. Flow cell data and multi‐physics simulation results confirm that a confined cavity geometry (diameter ∼130 nm) could increase local alkalinity significantly, suppressing HER and enhancing CO 2 reduction. The microenvironment was further modulated by changing the binder type, cation identity, and cation concentration. These findings establish cavity confinement as a powerful strategy to modulate the local reaction environment and enable selective CO 2 RR under highly acidic conditions, providing a viable pathway for efficient CO 2 electrolysis.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Multiferroic coupling represents a major research frontier in condensed matter physics and materials science, given its importance for both fundamental studies and device applications. While current investigations predominantly focus on magnetoelectric effects, coupling with ferroelastic order remains an outstanding challenge, especially for controlling it. Here, we report a magnetically switchable ferroelasticity effect in a 2D antiferromagnetic multiferroic lattice, where magnetization reorientation is coupled to reversible switching of ferroelastic polarization. The underlying physics originates from an intriguing spin‐lattice coupling induced by zigzag antiferromagnetic exchange, which produces an anisotropic exchange field and leads to lattice distortion. This spin‐lattice coupling gives rise to 120° ferroelasticity, enabling robust magnetic control of ferroelastic order. Using first‐principles calculations, we further validate this effect in multiferroic monolayer FePS 3 . Our findings open a new pathway for the design of multiferroics with magnetically controllable properties.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Electrolyte additives incorporating multiple functional groups effectively suppress zinc (Zn) anode side reactions, regulate crystal growth, and promote uniform Zn 2+ deposition. However, limited research focuses on the rational design of such additives prior to experiments. Herein, a molecular engineering strategy is proposed to design multifunctional electrolyte additives for synergistic stabilization of the Zn anode. Based on electronic structure calculations screening twenty functionalized amino acids, N‐Glycyl‐L‐tyrosine (GT) is rationally designed by assembling glycine (Gly) and tyrosine (Tyr). The carboxyl group of Gly enables strong coordination with Zn 2+ , regulating the solvation sheath and facilitating desolvation kinetics, while the phenolic hydroxyl and carbonyl groups of Tyr provide strong adsorption affinity toward specific Zn crystal faces. These interactions displace interfacial H 2 O molecules, effectively suppressing hydrogen evolution and corrosion. Moreover, the specific adsorption of GT on the (101) and (100) planes guides preferential epitaxial growth along the dense (002) direction, ensuring uniform Zn deposition and smooth surface morphology. Consequently, GT enables multifaceted synergistic stabilization of Zn||Zn symmetric and Zn||NaV 3 O 8 ·1.5H 2 O full cells. This work provides a molecular‐level design concept for developing advanced electrolyte additives to achieve highly stable Zn metal anodes.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aqueous zinc‐iodine (Zn‐I 2 ) batteries have attracted extensive attention as next‐generation energy storage systems due to their inherent safety, environmental benignity, and theoretical high capacity (211 mAh g −1 ). Nevertheless, their practical application is still hampered by the dissolution and shuttling of soluble polyiodides, leading to rapid capacity decay and inferior cycling stability. Although porous carbon‐based host materials physically confine iodine species, thereby improving electrochemical performance, the crucial role of surface functional groups on carbon (─OH, ─C═O, and ─COOH) in regulating the electrochemical behavior has been neglected. Herein, we designed and synthesized hierarchical micro‐mesoporous carbon (MMC) nanospheres rich with hydroxyl (─OH) and carbonyl (─C═O) groups as iodine hosts. The multiscale porous structure facilitates high iodine loading, while ─OH groups remarkably enhance the chemical adsorption of iodine species via O─H∙∙∙I bond, thereby suppress the shuttle effect. Additionally, ─C═O groups actively participate in additional Faradaic redox reactions. Consequently, the prepared I 2 /MMC‐Rich electrode delivers outstanding electrochemical performance: it provides an initial capacity of 160.87 mAh g −1 at 10 A g −1 and maintains 135.58 mAh g −1 after 25 000 cycles, with a capacity retention rate of 84%.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Defect engineering is a promising strategy in heterogeneous catalysis, while understanding how the defective sites affect reactivity still remains ambiguous. Herein, we demonstrated an in‐depth experimental study of dynamic interaction of CO 2 molecules on defective In 2 S 3 surfaces by integrating operando X‐ray photoelectron spectroscopy with infrared spectroscopy. More specifically, the formation of S vacancy could promote the electron enrichment on adjacent In sites for facilitating CO 2 molecule adsorption, accompanying with the emergence of high oxidation states of surface In sites. Upon light illumination, the adsorbed CO 2 molecules undergo a sequential transformation into *COOH and *CO intermediates. However, an unexpected upside‐down inversion of *CO species on defective In sites from In–*CO to In–*OC has been firstly observed, severely restraining desorption of CO product from In 2 S 3 surfaces. Further tailoring the electronic structure of defective In sites by substituting residual S atom with O atom for inhibiting *CO inversion, a significant improvement of CO evolution activity has been achieved (18.3 µmol g −1 h −1 ), nearly five times higher than that of pristine In 2 S 3 (3.77 µmol g −1 h −1 ). This work provides the new insights on dynamic roles of defect‐derived active sites in determining catalytic activity, which might offer opportunities for fine control of catalytic process.",

    "Abstract": "The steel manufacturing industry's push for decarbonization has led to interest in using biomass‐derived carbon (biocarbon) in electric arc furnaces (EAF), which typically rely on fossil‐based carbon. Supersonic air injectors deliver carbon particles at high speed through the freeboard to penetrate the EAF slag layer. This study compares the behavior of denser fossil‐derived carbon particles (density 800 kg m − 3 ) with lighter biocarbon particles (density 200 kg m − 3 ) when they are injected using a supersonic lance. While lighter particles reach higher peak velocities, they decelerate rapidly, especially at greater distances from the lance. This limits the injection range for the lighter particles. Potential mitigation strategies are examined. No significant advantage from coinjecting denser and lighter particles together is found, as it causes significant particle dispersion away from the injection axis. Lengthening the lance's mixing zone, where the particles interact with the supersonic airflow, provides only modest improvement in particle velocity and reduction in particle dispersion. Increasing the size of the particles, however, enables the biocarbon particles to maintain their speed for a longer distance. It is concluded that using larger particles and/or adjusting the lance position closer to the slag layer is likely needed for effective biocarbon injection.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The antioxidant defense system (ADS) within the tumor microenvironment restricts the efficacy of reactive oxygen species (ROS) based therapies by conferring intrinsic redox tolerance. To overcome this limitation, we develop a tumor cell membrane camouflaged liposomal nanoplatform (C‐MLip@LA) that modulates the ADS to enhance tumor‐targeted therapy through a synergistic reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) cascade. The system encapsulates L‐arginine (LA) as the core, anchors MnO 2 nanoparticles on the liposomal surface, and is cloaked with homologous tumor cell membranes, thereby enabling tumor‐specific recognition and immune evasion. C‐MLip@LA disassembles after cellular internalization, where MnO 2 depletes intracellular glutathione (GSH) and is reduced to Mn 2 + , thereby elevating ROS levels and enabling T 1 ‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Concurrently, the released LA reacts with endogenous H 2 O 2 to generate nitric oxide (NO). The interplay between NO and ROS initiates a cascade reaction that produces highly cytotoxic peroxynitrite, thereby amplifying immunogenic cell death and leading to pronounced tumor growth inhibition in a CT‐2A tumor model. Collectively, this work presents a biomimetic nanoplatform for redox‐modulated cancer therapy with integrated diagnostic and immunomodulatory functions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Despite the availability of antiviral drugs and vaccines, respiratory viral infections remain a serious global health burden. To identify novel therapeutic candidates, we performed metabolomic profiling comparing serum from patients infected with influenza or SARS‐CoV‐2 with healthy individuals. This analysis identified sphinganine‐phosphate (SA) as a potential protective metabolite. In a murine model of influenza infection, SA treatment significantly reduced viral load and attenuated inflammatory responses. Further mechanistic studies, including both in vivo and in vitro experiments, demonstrated that SA enhances antiviral immunity by promoting the proliferation and activation of CD8 + T cells and boosting the production of interferon‐γ and tumor necrosis factor‐α. This effect is mediated through the inhibition of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and subsequent activation of the Janus kinase 1/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 signaling pathway. Our study reveals, for the first time, that SA promotes CD8 + T cell‐mediated immunity against influenza infection, providing important insights for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This paper presents a critical review of one‐class classification (OCC). Old articles defined OCC in a vague way, which allowed OCC models to learn from multiple classes. This paper reconsiders the OCC definition, as training data includes solely one class, and samples belonging to other classes are not available. Moreover, the review introduces a new OCC taxonomy consisting of boundary, distance, probability, fake, and subtask‐based approaches. Additionally, the article reveals that many OCC algorithms have learned multiple classes. Common violations include accessing unlabeled datasets, importing other datasets, and hyperparameter tuning based on the testing results. In addition, this paper suggests two gray zones in OCC: creating fake datasets and fake OCC problems from scratch, and decomposing samples into smaller units for accessing multiple classes. These gray zones could contribute to future theory to learn from a single class. On the other hand, the application of OCC can use multiple classes; generally, multiple classes outperform a single class. However, the applications will no longer be OCC after learning multiple classes.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Human behavior change is needed to stop the triple planetary crisis. Zoos reach millions of people every year and there is evidence available that people do change their behavior because of zoo led interventions. Designing interventions with behavior change frameworks in mind can increase the efficacy of interventions. The Behavior Change Wheel is a guide for describing, designing and evaluating behavior change strategies, rooted in the COM‐B model. It can be used for retrospective assessment of existing interventions. Here we present a content analysis of websites of members of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA). We classified behavior change projects in relation to categories on the Behavior Change Wheel including Intervention Function and Policy Category. A total of 754 behavior change projects were identified and analyzed, resulting in 1650 Intervention Function and 1154 Policy Category codes. Persuasion ( n = 450) and Education ( n = 289) were the most frequently identified Intervention Functions. Communication/marketing ( n = 515, 68.30%), was the most frequently used Policy Category. Zoos themselves were most often the agents of behavior change and projects most frequently targeted the general public. Most projects used multiple intervention functions in conjunction with each other, with only 12.73% ( n = 210) of Intervention Functions occurring on their own. Combining Intervention Functions has positive implications for intervention effectiveness, but barriers to effectiveness such as limited project targets were identified. Developing behavior change projects in zoos with behavior change frameworks in mind would likely further increase the effectiveness of these projects.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the influence of build direction in Ti6Al4V substrates manufactured by Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion (EB-PBF) on the performance of Plasma Electrolytic Oxidation (PEO) coatings. Because of the inherent anisotropy of additively manufactured alloys, arising from differences in thermal history between the build and transverse directions, surface treatments and coating behavior may vary. To explore this, coatings were produced in a silicate–phosphate (Si–P) electrolyte under different current densities and treatment times. The resulting coatings were characterized in terms of morphology, crystalline phase composition, and corrosion performance. The results show that, although build direction affects the initial voltage response during PEO treatment, its influence on coating thickness and porosity is minimal. X-ray diffraction revealed the presence of both anatase and rutile TiO₂ phases, with anatase formation favored at lower current densities. Importantly, PEO treatment eliminated the corrosion anisotropy observed in uncoated Ti6Al4V manufactured by EB-PBF, leading to uniform protective behavior regardless of build direction. Overall, these findings demonstrate the potential of PEO to enhance the functional performance of additively manufactured titanium alloys for biomedical and aerospace applications. In addition, they underscore the importance of electrolyte composition and process optimization in tailoring surface properties.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract All machining processes involve vibrations originating from either the structural dynamics of the machinery system or the impact phenomena related to the interaction between the cutting tools and the workpieces. The latter can lead to a chip regeneration effect, which negatively impacts the machining quality, resulting in poor surface finishes or, in severe cases, damage to the machine tool or workpiece. Traditionally, analytical methods such as stability lobe diagrams and analytical models in the time and frequency domains have been employed to predict and mitigate chatter. These methods offer advantages such as simplicity, low computational cost, and ease of implementation. However, they often rely on assumptions that limit their accuracy, particularly under complex machining conditions. This paper presents the development of a novel analytical algorithm for chatter detection in the time domain, based on signal filtering and energy ratio evaluation. A comparison with the corresponding frequency domain and with other analytical approaches was conducted. The results show that the proposed method demonstrates performance for detection of chatter-free and severe chatter-affected machining processes. Moreover, the proposed analytical time domain algorithm (ATDA) exhibits greater sensitivity in handling non-stationary signals, especially in intermediate machining states, where moderate chatter is observed or where a severe transition from stable to unstable machining occurs. Furthermore, the evaluation of the computational costs confirmed that the proposed time domain method offers good computational performance, highlighting its suitability for in-process applications.",

Herein, dose- and time-dependent in vitro anticancer activity studies of anti-inflammatory drugs, including celecoxib ( C ), indomethacin ( I ), and meloxicam ( M ), in combination with natural products (taxifolin ( T ), quercetin ( Q ), and rutin ( R )) and doxorubicin (Dox), were carried out in MDA-MB-231, BT-20, MCF-7, and HT-29 human cancer cell lines. Drug C demonstrated significant anticancer activity in cancer cells with natural products (&lt; 40 µM) and Dox (&lt; 5 µM). The antiulcerative effect of the most promising drug C in combination with T and R in rats was carried out. The histopathological analysis suggests that the substitution of R with T , when combined with drug C , leads to a statistically significant improvement in the amelioration of gastric mucosal injury. Additionally, in silico studies have been conducted against the important cancer drug target sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1). The obtained results highlight that drug C and T may be potential inhibitor candidates as SphK1 inhibitors for targeted cancer therapy. Overall, the combination of drug C with T has shown promising results, anticancer effects in breast and colon cancer cells and antiulcerative effects in rats.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Rationale Opioid withdrawal is a serious obstacle to self-initiated abstinence, and previous experiences of opioid withdrawal may exacerbate the severity of subsequent incidences. Methods To study the impact of repeated opioid withdrawal episodes, we compared male and female mice after one or five cycles of fentanyl exposure and withdrawal. We selectively expressed hemagglutinin-tagged ribosomes (RiboTag) in microglia of transgenic mice to immunoprecipitate and sequence RNA actively undergoing translation (the “translatome”) from striatal microglia during fentanyl withdrawal. Key changes were confirmed by RTqPCR of RiboTag RNA. Results Repeated bouts of fentanyl treatment and withdrawal impacted striatal microglia much more than a single cycle of fentanyl followed by withdrawal. Multiple withdrawal cycles reduced ramification of microglial processes, suggesting a more reactive cell state, and induced more severe behavioral withdrawal signs in mice. Five cycles of fentanyl exposure and withdrawal increased the expression of gene networks associated with innate immunity signaling. Indeed, 100% of the genes associated with the “microglia core sensome”, were upregulated after five cycles of withdrawal. Conclusions Together these results suggest that mouse striatal microglia initiate a proinflammatory response following five, but not one, opioid exposure and withdrawal experiences and suggest that drug therapies targeting microglial innate immune responses may mitigate the severe withdrawal associated with repeated opioid tolerance and withdrawal.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study explores the feasibility of using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyse the volatilome of human melanoma A375 cells. The goal was to identify and characterise the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and monitor alterations induced by treatment with thapsigargin (TG), a drug known to disrupt calcium homeostasis, thereby inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress and ultimately triggering cell death. Reproducibility of experimental conditions is a major issue in biological experiments, which presents intrinsic variability of the samples to be analysed. In our case, initial analysis revealed a significant batch effect, accounting for 56.88% of the total variance. To address this, external parameter orthogonalisation (EPO) was applied, which successfully reduced the batch variance to just 0.16%. After this correction, the treatment factor became the dominant source of variation, explaining 47.12% of the total variance with strong statistical significance ( p -value = 0.001). A supervised classification model using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was developed and validated to characterise the differences between treated and untreated cells. The model achieved a mean overall accuracy of 92.21% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.974, indicating excellent discrimination between the two classes. The robustness of these findings was confirmed by repeated double cross-validation and permutation testing, which showed that the model’s predictive ability was not due to random chance. The results demonstrate that TG treatment induces a reproducible and highly discriminant volatilome signature in A375. This suggests that VOCs could potentially serve as biomarkers for monitoring cellular responses to drug treatments. Graphical abstract Graphical abstract created with BioRender.com",

    "Abstract": "Acute leukemia (AL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy that often causes serious complications and requires intensive care unit (ICU) treatment. Identifying risk factors for mortality in AL patients during and post-ICU admission can improve prognosis. This retrospective study enrolled AL patients first admitted to the ICU of the Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, from November 2008 to October 2023. It analyzed risk factors associated with ICU mortality, 1-month mortality and 6-month mortality, and conducted a subgroup analysis of the prognosis of ICU survivors. A total of 126 patients were included in this study, with a median age of 42 years. Acute respiratory failure (46%) and sepsis (23%) were the main reasons for ICU admission. Overall, the mortality rates were 57.9% in the ICU, 67.5% at 1 month, and 69% at 6 months. Notably, among the ICU survivors, 26.4% (14/53) died within 6 months, with 85.7% (12/14) occurring within the first month. The time from hospital admission to ICU transfer >10 days and invasive mechanical ventilation were independent risk factors for ICU mortality, 1-month mortality and 6-month mortality. Relapsed or refractory leukemia (OR = 20.715) and low albumin levels (OR = 34.428) were independent risk factors for death within one month among ICU survivors. The risk factors for mortality in AL patients admitted to the ICU exhibit dynamic changes across different stages. For ICU survivors, optimizing nutritional support and initiating anti-tumor treatment as early as possible after discharge are crucial for improving prognosis.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of the lncRNA-HBBP1 and lncRNA-XIST expression profiles in the diagnosis of β-thalassemia patients. One hundred children patients with β-thalassemia participated in this case-control study: 50 patients diagnosed as Beta Thalassemia Major (β-TM) and 50 patients diagnosed as Beta Thalassemia Intermedia (β-TI) groups. Furthermore, there were 50 children as healthy control group. Assessment of both genes’ expression was performed by RT-qPCR. The findings displayed that both lncRNA-HBBP1 and lncRNA-XIST were highly expressed within the β-TM group than in the β-TI and the control groups ( P &lt; 0.001 for both). The lncRNA-HBBP1 and lncRNA-XIST expression were significantly higher in β-thalassemia patients presented with jaundice, thalassemia facies, or organomegaly ( p &lt; 0.001 for all). In addition, lncRNA-XIST expression was significantly higher in β-thalassemia patients with splenectomy ( p = 0.002). Spearman correlation revealed that the expression of both genes was significantly correlated with HbF % in β-TM and β-TI groups ( p &lt; 0.001 for both). Based on the ROC curve analysis, the sensitivity of lncRNA-HBBP1 and lncRNA-XIST for discriminating the β-TM group from the β-TI group was 82% and 80%, respectively. Collectively, the examined lncRNAs could offer novel biomarkers for β-thalassemia disorder once confirmed in extensive upcoming investigations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The mutation of the plant homeodomain finger protein 6 gene ( PHF6 MUT ) in patients with myeloid neoplasms (MNs) is rare and appears to play a role in prognosis, though this is still under debate. We conducted a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 313 patients diagnosed with MNs. We also performed a systematic review (SR) of the literature to evaluate the prognostic role of PHF6 gene status in MNs. We identified 15 patients with PHF6 MUT . In the multivariate analysis, PHF6 MUT was associated with higher mortality compared to PHF6 wild − type (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00–1.05; P = 0.075), with no apparent impact from other co-mutations. In the multilevel logistic model by MN subtype, the presence of PHF6 MUT (independent of variant allele frequency &gt; 20%) was shown to have a positive coefficient (adverse prognosis) in acute myeloid leukemia; in the remainder of MNs, the effect was not significant. PHF6 MUT had a marginal and significant effect compared to PHF6 wild − type cases (HR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.05; P = 0.039). There were no significant differences in time to blast transformation or time to next treatment depending on PHF6 gene status. According to the results of most studies published to date (SR), PHF6 MUT has a prognostic role in MNs; our results are consistent in terms of clinical outcomes, but these marginal effects should be interpreted with caution in the context of existing prognostic models given the limitations of the small sample size.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The clinical success of FLT3 inhibitors has led to their steadily increasing use in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), both in the relapsed/refractory setting and as post-transplant maintenance. Despite their expanding application, there is currently no guidance on the optimal duration of therapy or the feasibility of discontinuation. In the maintenance context, current practice is largely based on trial protocols with predefined treatment periods, yet relapses after cessation have been documented. Similarly, in the relapsed/refractory setting, the management of long-term responders to FLT3 -directed monotherapy lacks evidence-based guidance. We report two cases of FLT3 -ITD AML patients with relapse after discontinuation of prolonged FLT3 inhibitor therapy, despite sustained remission prior to withdrawal. As such scenarios remain insufficiently characterized in the literature, these case vignettes are presented to highlight the unresolved challenge of defining the appropriate duration of FLT3 inhibitor therapy and to underscore the need for systematic evaluation to establish evidence-based strategies for safe discontinuation or extended administration.",

    "Abstract": "Epcoritamab, a CD3xCD20 bispecific antibody, resulted in deep, durable responses with a manageable safety profile in patients with relapsed/refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) in EPCORE<sup>®</sup> NHL-1 (NCT03625037). We report results from a 3-year follow-up. Adults with relapsed/refractory LBCL received epcoritamab until progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR). Median age was 64.0 years, 39% of patients received prior CAR T-cell treatment, and 75% were refractory to ≥ 2 consecutive lines of treatment. As of May 3, 2024 (median follow-up 37.1 months [range, 0.3-45.5]), ORR was 59% and complete response (CR) rate 41% by investigator assessment. Median duration of response was 20.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.0-32.0). Median duration of CR was 36.1 months (20.2-not reached [NR]); the longest ongoing CR was > 43 months. Median progression-free survival was 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.8-5.5) in all patients and 37.3 months (26.0-NR) in patients with CR. Median overall survival was 18.5 months (95% CI, 11.7-27.7) in all patients and NR in patients with CR. Of 119 patients evaluable for minimal residual disease (MRD) assessments, 54 (45%) were MRD-negative at any time during the study. Most common adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (51%), fatigue (25%), and pyrexia (25%), with no new safety signals. Grade 1, 2, and 3 infections occurred in 23%, 34%, and 24% of patients, respectively. The durability of responses and prolonged survival in complete responders suggest long-term disease-free survival with epcoritamab in these patients with relapsed/refractory LBCL.",

    "Abstract": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains the only curative treatment for aplastic anemia (AA). For patients lacking a matched sibling donor (MSD) or matched unrelated donor (MUD), haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT) has become an alternative with comparable efficacy. However, donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSAs) remain the principal barrier. In this study, we compared transplant outcomes in DSA-positive recipients after desensitization with plasma exchange (PE) combined with anti-B-cell therapy. Between January 2019 and December 2023, we enrolled 30 DSA-positive AA patients who underwent haplo-HSCT at our center. All received a desensitization regimen combining PE with anti-B-cell agents. By propensity-score matching (1:2 ratio, caliper 0.02), we additionally enrolled 60 DSA-negative controls matched for key clinical variables to compare therapeutic efficacy and long-term outcomes between the two groups. This study enrolled 90 AA patients who underwent haplo-HSCT: 30 were DSA-positive and 60 were DSA-negative. Baseline characteristics were comparable between the two groups. After desensitization with PE combined with anti-B-cell agents, the DSA-positive group achieved outcomes equivalent to those of the DSA-negative group. Specifically, EBV reactivation (46.7% vs. 68.3%; P = 0.002) was significantly better in the DSA-positive group. Engraftment, aGVHD, Effacacy, OS, and GRFS rates were similar between two groups. However, the risk of cGVHD remains higher in the DSA-positive group (40% vs. 12%; P = 0.009). For DSA-positive AA patients who are candidates for haplo-HSCT and for whom no DSA-negative donor can be identified, desensitization with PE combined with anti-B-cell agents represents an established strategy to improve transplant outcomes; nevertheless, close surveillance for cGVHD is warranted after transplantation.",

This study reports a 66-year-old male Chinese patient who presented with significantly prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and microcytic hypochromic anemia. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation in exon 6 of the KNG1 gene (c.718 C > T, p.Arg240*) in the proband. This mutation results from a cytosine-to-thymine substitution, generating a premature termination codon that leads to truncated HK protein translation and loss of function. Additionally, genetic testing identified a concurrent heterozygous α-thalassemia --<sup>SEA</sup>deletion in the proband, located at 16p13.3 and encompassing the HBA2 and HBA1 genes. Pedigree analysis indicated that both the proband and his sister were homozygous for the KNG1 mutation and exhibited prolonged aPTT, whereas their children and some descendants were heterozygous carriers with normal coagulation function. Within the same family, all heterozygous carriers of the α-thalassemia --<sup>SEA</sup>deletion presented with microcytic hypochromic anemia.

Homozygous Hb CS and compound heterozygous Hb CS/Hb Pakse can present with a wide clinical spectrum. In this study, 49 patients with these α-globin variants-with or without co-inheritance of beta-thalassemia-were evaluated. Genotypes included homozygous Hb CS (n = 27), homozygous Hb CS with Hb E (n = 8), compound heterozygous Hb CS/Hb Pakse (n = 10), compound heterozygous Hb CS/Hb Pakse with Hb E (n = 3), and homozygous Hb Pakse (n = 1). Fetal anemia with hydrops fetalis occurred in 25 patients; 21 underwent intrauterine transfusions (IUTs), resulting in favorable postnatal outcomes in most cases. Two patients with homozygous Hb CS died from complications of severe anemia and prematurity. Early neonatal jaundice occurred in 27 patients, most requiring phototherapy. Direct hyperbilirubinemia was observed in 10 patients; most recovered with supportive care and transfusion, though one died from progressive cholestasis. Twenty four patients required 1-2 postnatal transfusions, with only two requiring later transfusion. Four patients with childhood anemia were initially misdiagnosed with iron deficiency anemia before confirmation of α-thalassemia variants. After the first few months of life, patients typically exhibit mild hypochromic microcytic anemia, elevated red cell distribution width, and reticulocytosis, with basophilic stippling more prominent in Hb CS. During follow-up (3-160 months, median 66), no patients developed hepatosplenomegaly, iron overload, or gallstones. These α-thalassemia variants may cause severe fetal anemia requiring IUT but generally evolve into transfusion-independent mild anemia. Early detection and targeted intervention can improve outcomes in high-prevalence regions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Management of childhood-onset craniopharyngioma (CP) may be challenging, given its rarity and complexity as well as the risks associated with treatment. We aimed at investigating how the practice of neurosurgical management of CP in children differs among neurosurgical centres in Nordic countries. Methods We performed a survey containing 28 questions and focusing on organization of care, expertise availability, treatment decisions and strategies, and follow-up routines, respectively. The survey was distributed to 21 neurosurgical centres in five Nordic countries. Results We obtained answers from 18 centres (86% response rate). In 61% of centres, only 0–1 new cases are treated per year. In only one country (Denmark), the neurosurgical treatment of pediatric CP is centralized to one centre. While all cases are discussed at MDT meetings before surgery and during the follow-up, management strategies, including surgical indications, goals, and approaches, vary substantially among responding centres. Conclusion The practice of neurosurgical management of pediatric CP in the Nordic countries is characterized by relatively low case volumes, differing management strategies, as well as varying degrees of centralization and collaboration between pediatric and adult neurosurgeons. Although some practical aspects may be unique for healthcare practised in the Nordic countries, the results of this survey and, in particular, the embedded discussion of centralization – either restricted to surgery or including complete management of pediatric CP – seem relevant and may provide useful insights also to neurosurgeons outside of the Nordics.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose To evaluate the acceptance of micronutrient therapy in women with symptoms related to a pathological neurostress profile and to explore its association with patient-reported outcomes such as perceived efficacy, side effects, compliance, and perceived lack of information. Methods This retrospective observational study included women aged ≥ 18 years who underwent neurostress testing followed by micronutrient therapy. The study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital Bern. Patients were invited to complete the validated ACCEPT© questionnaire to assess their level of treatment acceptance. Descriptive statistics and non-parametric tests were applied, and correlations were analyzed using Spearman’s rho. Results Eighty-one women participated. Overall treatment acceptance was high, with a median ACCEPT© score of 88.9 (Q1 = 66.6, Q3 = 100). Acceptance of drug-related constraints scored high (median = 100), whereas acceptance of treatment duration was lower (median = 66.6). Side effects were well tolerated (median = 100), and perceived efficacy was rated positively (median = 100). General acceptance correlated significantly with perceived efficacy (p &lt; 0.001) and side effects (p &lt; 0.001), but not with compliance (p = 0.084). A negative correlation was found with the perceived lack of information (p = 0.043). Conclusion Micronutrient therapy in women with a pathological neurostress profile was highly accepted, particularly regarding treatment-related constraints and side effects. Acceptance was closely linked to perceived efficacy, highlighting the importance of patient-centered communication and expectation management.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Since 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has regulated personal data within the scope of the European Union. With the exponential technological advancements in mobile photography, it is crucial to expose forensic professionals to this body of law to maintain good practices for fieldwork and scientific research in this field. GDPR, as far as its application in forensic photography, can be broken down into four pillars: informed consent of the subject, acceptable image capture practices (data), data storage and security at rest, and data transfers and security in transit. All these pillars have different approaches currently in use by forensic professionals. However, only some of them are permitted under the law. We present the appropriate ways to proceed with smartphone photography while remaining in compliance and maintaining the ability to share data critical to fieldwork and scientific research. In addition, some of the common pitfalls are described. An algorithm is proposed to facilitate compliance with European regulations relating to personal data, as applied to mobile forensic photography. The same flow chart can be used in other countries with different regulations concerning health data, privacy, and security issues.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The reliable diagnosis of one of the many types of B-cell lymphoma (BCL) currently requires an integrated approach comprising morphological expertise, immunophenotyping, and inclusion of clinical data, but may also incorporate flow cytometry, cytogenetics, and clonality analysis. In recent years, several studies have elucidated the mutational landscape of BCL, which may also serve as a complementary diagnostic tool. We have developed a custom next-generation sequencing panel for application in the routine diagnosis of BCL based on available literature and our diagnostic questions. We applied this panel to 160 cases of BCL or with this differential diagnosis (DD) in our routine workflow to gain further diagnostic support or on clinical request. Evaluable results were obtained in all but two cases of the entire cohort. Diagnostically informative molecular genetic profiles were identified in 72% of the evaluable cases. Focusing on 21 challenging cases with the DD of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) and the germinal center B-cell-like subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), we detected at least one mutation in all cases, and in 18/21 (86%) cases, panel sequencing provided significant decision guidance. In conclusion, although morphology and immunohistochemistry remain the backbone of diagnosis, panel sequencing provided substantial diagnostic assistance in many cases. It has been particularly useful in providing additional arguments to clarify the clinically important DD between BL and DLBCL in challenging cases.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Metabolic renal cell carcinomas (RCC) deficient in succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) or fumarate hydratase (FH) are rare but clinically significant entities formalized in the last WHO classification. Their recognition typically starts from morphology and is corroborated by targeted immunohistochemistry (IHC) and, where appropriate, molecular and germline testing. In routine practice, however, implementation may be uneven. Hence, we conducted a nationwide, web-based survey (made by 25 items) among members of the Italian Study Group of Uropathology (GIUP) to map real-world awareness, diagnostic pathways, and test availability across Italian centers. Twenty-one pathologists responded; 18/21 (85.7%) reported dedicated uropathology practice with heterogeneous seniority (≤ 5 years, 28.6%; 5–10 years, 19.0%; 10–20 years, 14.3%; &gt; 20 years, 38.1%). Despite substantial renal-tumor workloads (12/20, 57.1% handled &gt; 100 cases in the previous 5 years), direct exposure to metabolic RCCs remained limited (FH-deficient ≥ 1 case, 11/21, 52.4%; SDH-deficient ≥ 1 case, 9/21, 42.9%). Suspicion was predominantly morphology-led: for SDH-deficient RCC, morphology ranked first in 16/21 (76.2%) with the commonest sequence morphology &gt; age &gt; number of lesions (76.2%); for FH-deficient RCC, morphology was top-ranked in 19/21 (90.5%). Key morphologic cues were mixed architectural patterns/papillary elements/macronucleoli for FH-deficient RCC, and eosinophilic cytoplasm with solid–alveolar architecture for SDH-deficient RCC. IHC mirrored these priorities (FH top for FH-deficient, 85.7%; SDHB top for SDH-deficient, 76.2%), whereas 2-succinocysteine (2SC) was rarely available (1/21, 4.8%). Critically, this FH-loss-only workflow can miss non-truncating FH variants (FH immunoreactive but enzymatically inactive) tumors, contributing to under-recognition. Molecular testing would be requested in all suspected cases by 12/21 (57.1%); among selective users, equivocal IHC was the leading trigger (6/8, 75%). Overall, metabolic RCC recognition in Italy is primarily morphology-driven but constrained by uneven access to confirmatory IHC, particularly 2SC, and to molecular assays. The findings argue for harmonized diagnostic algorithms, regional reference laboratory networks, and routine involvement of molecular tumor boards, supported by targeted educational initiatives (including curated digital slide repositories), to standardize practice and improve patient pathways from morphologic suspicion to genetic counselling and tailored surveillance.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Nakadake Volcano in Aso Caldera, central Kyushu, southwest Japan, is among the most active volcanoes in Japan. Eruption records date back to 553 CE, with over 150 eruptions documented since 1239 CE. However, details of individual eruptions and their geological correlations remain unclear. We conducted a trench survey ~ 1 km west of the Nakadake crater to reconstruct the volcano’s historical eruptive sequence. Here, we describe the tephra layers, radiocarbon dating, grain size analysis, microscopic observation, and chemical analysis. The 6-m-high trench revealed 336 thin ash layers (average thickness, 1.8 cm), indicating frequent small-scale eruptions. Based on tephra characteristics, analytical results, and 14 C dating, the sequence was divided into four zones: Zone A (0–158 cm, mid-1700s to present), Zone B (163–333 cm, late 1400s to early 1700s), Zone C (343–416 cm, mid-1300s to mid-1400s), and Zone D (416–595 cm, 1239 CE to mid-1300s). Zone D tephras, primarily dark coarse ash layers rich in juvenile glass shards, suggest dominant ash emissions and strombolian eruptions. Zone C tephras indicate that dominant eruptive styles transitioned from magmatic to phreatic or phreatomagmatic activity. Zone B tephras feature alternating light-colored fine ash layers with lithic fragments and altered minerals, indicating frequent phreatic and/or phreatomagmatic eruptions over 200–250 years. Zone A tephras, mostly dark coarse ash layers, imply dominance by ash emissions and strombolian eruptions in the last 250 years. The total bulk tephra volume for the past 800 years was ~ 0.35 km 3 , yielding an average discharge rate of 0.2 km 3 /ky (dense rock equivalent), consistent with the last 67,000 years. This suggests that eruptive activity at Nakadake over the past 800 years was typical for the post-caldera stage of Aso Volcano, supported by a stable magma supply system with minimal chemical variation. However, eruption types varied between Zones A and D. Frequent phreatic/phreatomagmatic eruptions between the late 1400s and early 1700s likely disrupted human activities, potentially contributing to the decline of the Furubochu mountain temple site (1–2 km west of the crater). This study highlights the historical eruption transitions and provides insights for predicting future volcanic activity and mitigating related hazards at Nakadake Volcano.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Rectal gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) are uncommon and technically challenging to treat due to the confined pelvic anatomy and proximity to the anal sphincter complex. The oncological goal of surgery is R0 resection, but radical procedures often compromise function. Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM/TEO) provides stable exposure and precise full-thickness excision, offering the possibility of organ preservation. The role of tumour size and neoadjuvant imatinib in enabling local excision remains under investigation. Methods We conducted a retrospective single-centre study of all consecutive patients undergoing TEM/TEO for rectal GIST between January 2007 and May 2023. Clinicopathological data, operative outcomes, postoperative course, and follow-up were analysed. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated with the Kaplan–Meier method. Results Thirteen patients were included. Median age was 55 years (IQR 48–69), 69.2% were male, and median BMI was 26.1 kg/m 2 (IQR 22.4–28.0). The median tumour distance from the anal verge was 6.0 cm (IQR 4.0–7.0), and the median pathological size was 5.0 cm (IQR 5.0–7.0). Two patients (15.4%) received neoadjuvant imatinib. Spinal anaesthesia was used in 69.2% of cases, with a median operative time of 80 min (IQR 60–110 min). Peritoneal opening occurred in one case (7.7%), which was repaired transanally. No conversions were required. Median hospital stay was 4 days (IQR 2–6), with no recorded postoperative complications; one patient (7.7%) required salvage reintervention. R0 resection was achieved in 92.3%. At a median follow-up of 60 months, two patients (15.4%) developed local recurrence and one patient (7.7%) died. The 12-month Kaplan–Meier estimates were 92.3% for DFS and 100.0% for OS. Conclusion TEM/TEO achieved a high rate of R0 resection with organ preservation in this small single-centre series of rectal GIST. Tumour size alone should not be considered an absolute contraindication when en-bloc excision without rupture and negative margins are technically achievable. Neoadjuvant imatinib may facilitate local excision in selected borderline cases, but our experience is limited and larger multicentre registries are required to better define selection criteria and long-term outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose The surgical management of severe adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) remains a subject of ongoing discussion among spine-deformity surgeons. While there has been a prevailing shift towards posterior-only fusion (PF) techniques, anterior release with posterior fusion (ARPF) may still be valuable for the correction of large or stiff curves. This study compared the clinical and radiological outcomes of PF and ARPF in a high-volume spinal deformity unit. Methods Patients aged 10–18 years with AIS and a major thoracic curve ≥ 70 ° (Lenke Types 1–4), who underwent PF or ARPF between 2010 and 2019, with ≥ 2 years of follow-up were included. Correction index formed the primary outcome, complemented by several secondary radiological and clinical measures assessed preoperatively, at first-erect radiograph and final follow-up. Results Eighty-nine patients were included (PF = 51; ARPF = 38). Baseline characteristics were similar except ARPF patients were younger (13.7 vs 1.4.8, p = 0.001) and less skeletally mature (Risser 0–2: 60.5% vs 37.3%). Baseline Cobb angle was comparable ( p = 0.0634), but ARPF patients had stiffer curves ( p = 0.0257), reduced flexibility ( p = 0.0408), and achieved a significantly higher CI at final follow-up (248.2% vs. 168.1%, p = 0.0024). Operative time, blood loss and length of stay were greater for ARPF. Conclusions ARPF offers a corrective advantage for patients with stiffer curves and lower skeletal maturity, who are at risk of developing crankshaft phenomena. However, the increased operative morbidity supports PF alone as sufficient for most patients. These results highlight the importance of tailoring surgical strategy to curve characteristics and skeletal maturity to optimise correction and minimise risk.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADES) have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional organic solvents, offering advantages such as low melting points and biodegradability, aligned with green chemistry principles. In this work, a hydrophobic NADES (hNADES) composed of menthol and decanoic acid (1:1 molar ratio) was combined with soy wax to formulate a biodegradable binder for carbon paste electrodes (CPE), serving as a substitute for mineral oil. The binder and its precursors were characterized by thermal analyses (TGA/DTG and DSC) and FTIR spectroscopy, which evidenced chemical interactions between soy wax and hNADES through marked shifts in functional groups associated with hydrogen-bond formation. A hydrophilic ternary NADES based on glucose, tartaric acid, and glycerol (tNADES (gly) ) was also incorporated to enhance conductivity by improving paste cohesion and promoting proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) mechanisms, attributed to the presence of free carboxylic acid groups. Electrochemical performance was assessed via cyclic voltammetry, enabling optimization of composition and identification of CPE (50) /hNADES:wax(3:1)/20%tNADES (gly) as the most suitable formulation. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy further confirmed a pronounced decrease in charge-transfer resistance for the sustainable composite when compared with mineral-oil-based CPE (bare CPE). The resulting electrode, composed exclusively of non-toxic and biodegradable components, was evaluated to detect ascorbic acid, paracetamol, and sulfamethoxazole using differential pulse voltammetry, demonstrating its potential as an environmentally friendly electrochemical sensor which application could be further investigated to detect pollutants in hydric resources, for instance. The most significant analytical response was observed for paracetamol oxidation, presenting higher peak current values and better concentration-current correlation than the bare CPE (mineral oil composition).",

    "Abstract": "Abstract To examine the short-term therapeutic effects of Bioptron light therapy (BLT) on dry eye disease (DED) in postmenopausal women. Sixty postmenopausal women diagnosed with DED, aged 50–62 years with a body mass index ≤ 30 kg/m², were randomly assigned to two equal groups. The Bioptron group ( n = 30) received BLT for 10 min, twice weekly, along with an educational program for four weeks. The control group ( n = 30) received the same educational program only. Outcomes were measured using Schirmer’s test (Schirmer I) for basal tear secretion, Tear Break-Up Time (TBUT) for tear film stability, and the Dry Eye-related Quality of Life Score (DEQS) for quality of life (QOL). Both groups exhibited significant improvements post-treatment compared to pre-treatment in all variables, with greater percentage changes from baseline in the BLT group. Between-group comparisons revealed significantly higher improvements in the BLT group: Schirmer’s test (Schirmer I) improved by MD = 8.7 (95% CI: 7.64–9.76; p = 0.001), TBUT by MD = 2.97 (95% CI: 1.7–4.3; p = 0.007), and DEQS decreased by MD = − 24.1 (95% CI: −37 to − 17.1; p = 0.002). Compared with standardized education alone, adjunctive Bioptron light therapy significantly enhanced tear secretion, tear film stability, and patient-reported symptoms, suggesting its potential as an effective non-pharmacological option for managing dry eye in postmenopausal women.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Long-term outcomes in patients with lung metastases from sarcomas remain unreported. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical utility of lung radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in 52 patients with musculoskeletal sarcoma-derived lung metastases. Patients The study cohort included 29 men and 23 women with a mean age of 55 years at the time of the initial lung RFA, with a mean follow-up duration of 49.2 months. Complete treatment was defined as achieving a tumor-free status following the initial lung RFA. Cases failing to achieve this were classified as incomplete treatment. Results At the final follow-up, 14 patients remained alive, while 38 had died from this disease. Multivariate analysis confirmed that complete ablation and longer disease-free interval were significant prognostic factors. The median survival time for the 27 patients with complete treatment was 96.7 months, compared with 13.1 months for the 25 patients with incomplete treatment. The 3- and 5-year survival rates after the initial RFA in the 27 patients with complete treatment were 55.3% and 51.4%, respectively, whereas the corresponding rates for the incomplete treatment group were 16% and 10.7%. Of the 27 patients who achieved complete treatment, 4 had no new lung metastases, whereas 23 developed new lung metastases and/or local relapse. Local tumor progression occurred in 30 of 266 lung tumors (11%); larger tumors showed a higher incidence of progression. No procedure-related mortality was reported. Conclusions Lung RFA can be a valuable option for treating lung metastases in patients with musculoskeletal sarcoma.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Although proteinuria is a key prognostic marker in immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), the optimal post-biopsy timing for its assessment remains uncertain, particularly given variability in treatment type and timing. Using longitudinal data from the Japan IgA Nephropathy Prospective Cohort Study (J-IGACS), we sought to identify the post-biopsy time point at which proteinuria most reliably predicts kidney outcomes. Methods Proteinuria was assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after biopsy. The primary outcome was defined as a ≥ 50% increase in serum creatinine or initiation of kidney replacement therapy in adults (≥ 20 years) and as a ≥ 25% decline in eGFR or initiation of kidney replacement therapy in patients aged &lt; 20 years. Model performance was compared using the corrected Akaike Information Criterion. Results Among 588 patients (median age 38 years; mean eGFR 76.5 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; median proteinuria 0.64 g/day), 43 (7.3%) reached the primary outcome during a median 78-month follow-up. Proteinuria at all time points was independently associated with kidney outcomes, with the 18-month measurement providing the best model fit. A threshold of 0.44 g/day (or g/gCr) yielded 79% sensitivity and 81% specificity, and patients with proteinuria ≥ 0.44 g/day at 18 months had significantly worse outcomes. Cox regression confirmed a robust association for 18-month proteinuria, irrespective of treatment type or timing. Conclusions Proteinuria measured 18 months post-biopsy showed the strongest association with long-term kidney outcomes in IgAN, supporting its use as a universal treatment target across heterogeneous post-biopsy clinical courses.",

This manuscript provides a structured, contemporary description of the standardized operative method, including patient selection, anesthesia strategies, stepwise dissection, nerve-preserving principles, and evidence-based mesh placement and fixation. Emphasis is placed on precise anatomic exposure, atraumatic cord mobilization, and a tension-free configuration to minimize chronic pain and mesh-related complications. Current evidence and international guidelines continue to support the Lichtenstein repair as the benchmark open approach, demonstrating recurrence and reoperation rates comparable to minimally invasive techniques while maintaining advantages in safety and accessibility across diverse clinical settings.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Strawberries ( Fragaria × ananassa ) are a vital fruit crop in Türkiye, ranking fifth globally in production. However, fungal diseases like leaf spot and fruit rot, recently associated with Neopestalotiopsis rosae , have emerged as significant threats. This study aimed to identify and characterize N. rosae using morphological and molecular tools and assess the resistance of Turkish strawberry genotypes. Field surveys conducted in 2019–2020 in Adana province collected symptomatic samples from 15 fields. Morphological examination on PDA revealed dense white mycelia with ellipsoidal, five-celled conidia bearing 2–3 apical appendages. Pathogenicity tests confirmed N. rosae as the causal agent, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. Disease severity, scored on a 0–3 scale, indicated that genotypes Sweet Charlie, Camarosa, Benicia, and Tüylü were highly susceptible, while Fortuna, Elsanta, and Eren 77 exhibited strong resistance. Twelve isolates were sequenced for the ITS region using ITS1/ITS4 primers and deposited in GenBank (PV065744-PV065761), showing 99–100% similarity with global N. rosae isolates from China, Serbia, Canada, and Peru. Phylogenetic analysis clustered Turkish isolates with international N. rosae strains and others. Fruit infection assays revealed that ‘Fortuna’ had the lowest lesion development, while ‘Sweet Charlie’ and ‘Camarosa’ showed the highest susceptibility. This study highlights the emerging threat of N. rosae in Türkiye and supports breeding efforts toward developing resistant strawberry varieties suited for Mediterranean climates.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The red seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis can reduce methane emissions in livestock by over 90%, but its mariculture remains in its infancy and biomass for research and commercial use relies partly on wild populations. Knowledge on the impacts of harvesting A. taxiformis is lacking, emphasising the need for ecological research to guide the development of its sustainable harvesting. This study examined the regrowth potential of A. taxiformis meadows following small-scale harvesting. A harvest experiment testing the methods, handpicking and cutting, was conducted in Gladstone, Queensland, Australia, during the austral winter, with plots monitored over six months. Harvesting immediately affected percent cover and shoot length. Handpicked and cut plots exhibited regrowth within four to five months in terms of cover, which notably exceeded or were slightly above that of control plots. The shoot length of harvested plots paralleled that of control plots and was mainly influenced by seasonality. Control plots exhibited reduced growth at three months, suggesting that harvesting mimicked the seasonal reduction in biomass after the winter peak. This study also demonstrated the importance of vegetative propagation in the regrowth of A. taxiformis . The sessile benthic community in harvested plots underwent temporal shifts similar to those in the control plots, indicating that harvesting did not substantially alter community dynamics. Approximately 19 taxa of mobile fauna were recorded within Asparagopsis meadows, potentially indicating its habitat role. Overall, these findings provide ecological insights into the harvesting impacts on this seaweed, with further studies needed to assess broad-scale and long-term impacts.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Two carbon fiber reinforced type IV pressure vessels are subjected to step-wise pressurization until burst, while monitored using acoustic emissions (AE). Unlike most prior studies, AE data is collected throughout the entire damage progression. The vessels, manufactured with differing parameters, failed in distinct composite layers – A-type in the hoop layers and B-type in the helical layers. The AE signals are evaluated to study material degradation and identify fiber breaks as signs of critical damage accumulation. The signals are distributed randomly across the surface, with localized accumulation only minutes before rupture, close to the rupture plane. The difference in manufacturing parameters did not result in any clear difference in the AE activity. Felicity and Shelby ratios show consistent decline with increasing pressure, suggesting potential for damage assessment and burst prediction. It is discussed how these ratios are affected by coupling quality of the AE sensors, the shape of the pressurization profile and prior loadings. Different signal features based on the amplitude and the frequency content are extracted for a classification into failure mechanisms. Based on previous studies, AE signals corresponding to fiber breaks have a characteristic high-frequency spectrum and show a delay in occurrence, with an increase in the number of breaking fibers towards the end of the experiment. Indeed, high frequency signals tend to occur later and signals in specific peak-frequency ranges (350 – 400 kHz, &gt; 500 kHz) somewhat resemble the expected behavior. However, the dataset is too variable and too incongruent for any clear interpretations. Likely reasons are signal propagation effects, the complex composite structure, simultaneous occurrence of signals and measurement uncertainties. A review of relevant studies is provided to show that similar issues affect also previous works. Successfully identifying fiber breaks in large-scale, complex composite structures based on AE data, and turning this into an applicable health-monitoring technique, therefore remains a challenge.",

We prove that the empirical neighborhood distribution of this model satisfies a large deviation principle in the framework of local weak convergence. We rely on the concept of BC-entropy introduced by Delgosha and Anantharam (2019) which is inspired on the previous work by Bordenave and Caputo (2015). Our main technical contribution is an approximation result that allows one to pass from graph with marks in discrete spaces to marks in general Polish spaces. As an application of the results developed here, we prove a large deviation principle for interacting diffusions driven by gradient evolution and defined on top of sparse Erdős-Rényi random graphs. In particular, our results apply for the stochastic Kuramoto model. We obtain analogous results for the sparse uniform random graph with given number of edges.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study aims to qualitatively explore the barriers encountered by science teachers in Türkiye during the process of integrating a specifically developed e-Argumentation software into their lessons. The challenges were analyzed using Ertmer’s (1999) model of primary (external) and secondary (internal) barriers, alongside Tsai and Chai’s (2012) framework of third-order barriers, within a qualitative case study design. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with 12 science teachers and analyzed via thematic content analysis. Findings revealed significant primary barriers, including insufficient technological infrastructure, software usability issues, and curriculum constraints, alongside secondary barriers such as adherence to traditional pedagogies and technology-related anxieties. Crucially, the study also identified third-order barriers, specifically a deficiency in teachers’ pedagogical design capacity to orchestrate complex, technology-supported inquiry. Beyond cataloging these obstacles, this study’s primary contribution is to illuminate the synergistic relationship between them. It argues that secondary barriers and third-order design deficiencies often emerge as rational responses to an ecosystem defined by systemic primary barriers. The findings therefore suggest that successful technology integration is less about providing tools and more about cultivating a supportive educational ecosystem that addresses systemic inequities and empowers teachers as key agents of educational change.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Context Agricultural intensification leads to habitat loss and fragmentation, disrupting plant-pollinator interactions directly and indirectly, through changes in landscape configuration and altered land-use practices. This has detrimental consequences for the persistence of plants, pollinators, and the ecosystem services they provide. Objectives We investigated the drivers by which landscape and agricultural context (what crops are being grown) impact pollination services and the reproductive success of native plant species in remnant vegetation within an agricultural mosaic landscape. Specifically, we evaluate the direct and indirect effects of landscape fragmentation (remnant size and edge effect) and the crop type adjacent to natural remnants on bee communities and native plants’ seed production. Methods We combined bee community surveys with field pollination experiments on four native annual plant species in core and edge remnants in the York gum-Jam woodlands of SW Western Australia, an endangered ecosystem. For each remnant, we recorded remnant size, adjacent crop type (canola or wheat), and local community predictors (floral abundance, canopy cover, and organic ground cover). We assessed how landscape and local community predictors influence bee communities and reproductive success in our focal plant species, to evaluate variation in pollination services across highly fragmented and isolated vegetation remnants. Results Bee abundance was higher in remnants adjacent to canola than wheat. Native bee abundance decreased, however, from the core to the edge of remnants adjacent to canola (but not wheat), suggesting a possible pollinator dilution effect next to flowering canola fields. Canola directly and indirectly increased seed production of the focal plant species, mediated by changes in bee abundance. Species-specific responses at the local scale resulted in higher pollen limitation in areas with abundant floral resources and low bee abundance. Conclusions Adjacent crop type, position within remnants, and remnant size are all associated with variation in bee abundances and plant reproduction. At local scales, variation in floral abundances relates to pollination services. Our findings indicate that adjacent crop type, combined with the abundance of bees (generalist insect pollinators) in remnant vegetation, impacts the reproductive success of native plants persisting in remnants of an endangered annual plant system within an intensively managed agricultural landscape.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Obesity-induced insulin resistance is an escalating global health challenge that substantially contributes to the development of metabolic disorders, including type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. This narrative review critically examines the molecular and cellular mechanisms linking excess adiposity to impaired insulin action, with a particular focus on adipose tissue dysfunction, chronic low-grade inflammation, and oxidative stress. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, covering preclinical and clinical studies published primarily over the past two decades. Evidence indicates that adipocyte hypertrophy and hypoxia promote excessive free fatty acid release, ectopic lipid accumulation, and lipotoxicity, thereby disrupting insulin signalling pathways. Numerous clinical studies report that obesity triggers chronic, low-grade inflammation in the liver and pancreas, activating pathways such as NF-κB and SOCS proteins, thereby disrupting insulin signalling. Concurrently, obesity-associated inflammation drives immune cell infiltration and macrophage polarization toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, further exacerbating insulin resistance and metabolic dysregulation. This review also synthesizes current therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms, including insulin-sensitizing agents, anti-inflammatory therapies, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, as well as emerging approaches. Future perspectives highlight the growing relevance of personalized medicine, pharmacogenomics, digital health tools, and gene-based interventions in improving therapeutic precision. A deeper understanding of these interconnected pathways is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate obesity-related insulin resistance and its global metabolic consequences.

    "Abstract": "Abstract According to an influential view in the debate on grounding and essence, there cannot be any cases of ‘upwards essence’, i.e., cases in which a grounding connection flows from the essence of the grounding truth or constituents of it. To use the Finean (2012a) slogan, “it is the fact to be grounded that ‘points’ to its grounds and not the grounds that point to what they may ground”. This paper argues to the contrary. Far from being outright incoherent, potential cases of upwards essence abound. The arguments that have been raised against upwards essence or naturally come to mind turn out to be wanting on closer examination. And we can even derive the existence of certain cases of upwards essence from fairly innocuous general principles.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Nozick famously argued that life inside an Experience Machine (EM) is dismal because it severs our connection to external reality. Would life spent in Virtual Reality (VR) be similarly dismal? Chalmers argues that because VR is importantly different from an EM, life in VR can be roughly as good as life outside. Chalmers further argues for Virtual Realism, the view that virtual worlds can be unqualifiedly real. I examine the relation between these claims about VR and the idea that there’s special value in connecting to the external world. The EM itself, I argue, can only weakly support the value of such a connection. And VR, as understood by Chalmers, is different from the EM precisely by permitting us to retain extensive links to the non-virtual world. We can better test the value of a connection to external reality by considering a more restrictive version of VR. This narrower form of VR is, I argue, inferior to life outside in several ways. Some of my arguments for this also support the idea of a valuable connection with reality—but only if Virtual Realism is false. By contrast, and contrary to the impression given by Chalmers, Virtual Realism seems to make little difference to questions about the value of life in VR vs. life outside.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper argues that two of the theoretical virtues—ontological and ideological parsimony—reduce to a more foundational and familiar theoretical imperative to avoid positing brute facts. Following recent developments in metaphysics, I characterize ontological and ideological parsimony as principles that impose theoretical costs on fundamental ontology and primitive ideology respectively. I subsequently argue that both sorts of theoretical commitment entail costly brute (i.e., ungrounded) commitments. We can thus understand ontological and ideological parsimony as reducing to brute fact parsimony . After defending this proposal against objections, I extend it to the non-fundamental by introducing the notion of domain-relative bruteness, thereby explaining parsimony’s role in the special sciences. If my argument is successful, then it is now possible to weigh previously incommensurable virtues against each other. I suggest that this may facilitate progress in the debate about the laws of nature.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Speed is a pivotal factor in cycling mobility, influencing travel times, convenience, accessibility, and mode choice. However, empirical models of cycling speed, particularly for electric bicycles, remain limited. This study aims to examine the impact of infrastructure and topographic determinants on cycling speeds and network performance of electric bicycles, compared to conventional bicycles. Using a comprehensive GPS-based dataset from São Paulo’s Tembici bikesharing system, we employ linear mixed-effects models to analyze detailed variations in cycling speeds at the tracking point level, and linear regression at the trip level to assess overall trip dynamics. Novel variables, such as car traffic data from Uber, are incorporated, along with interactions between road segment length and cycling infrastructure type. Results show that electric bicycles consistently achieve higher speeds than conventional bikes, especially on challenging terrains and longer trips, due to motor assistance. Car speed significantly reduces speed for both conventional and electric bicycles. Segregated cycling infrastructure significantly increases speeds, with the greatest benefits observed for e-bikes on steep gradients. At intersections and traffic lights, e-bikes show greater sensitivity to stops in the segment-based analysis, but they recover more quickly at the trip level. E-bikes also led to a 14.2% improvement in the global efficiency of the cycling network, a measure of how effectively the network supports movement between all pairs of nodes, and our analysis of betweenness centrality showed that e-bikes change the importance of specific routes, making longer roads more critical. These findings underscore the importance of targeted investments in cycling infrastructure, particularly segregated lanes, to optimize e-bike performance, and support sustainable urban transport systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Massive open online courses (MOOCs) offer a unique opportunity for lifelong learning by providing a learning platform for a large and diverse audience. Although their popularity is still growing, industry experts had anticipated a higher level of acceptance than has actually occurred. One possible reason for the slower-than-expected growth is the perceived risk to learners. This study examines the factors influencing MOOC adoption based on perceived risk theory. Using survey-based quantitative analysis (with responses from 300 university students), the authors define four main dimensions of perceived risk: value, non-financial investment, social risk and security. Their findings show that uncertainty about the value offered by MOOCs is one of the most important dimensions in assessing risk. The second most important risk factor is learners’ non-financial investment. The main sources of this investment, time and effort, are finite for learners and thus represent a critical dimension in the educational context of risk research. Social factors also have an impact on perceived risk, albeit to a lesser extent, while security factors do not. The results suggest that MOOC developers and providers play an important role in reducing risks associated with delivery uncertainty and in optimising learners’ time and energy.",

We extend the flexible generalized skew-normal (FGSN) density of Ma and Genton (2004). The main novelty is the inclusion of a fifth-degree term in the odd polynomial that appears inside the normal cumulative distribution function. In this setting, we show that the resulting density has at most three modes under suitable constraints on the parameters. We conduct an extensive comparative analysis with several established benchmark models, highlighting the increased flexibility and improved goodness-of-fit of the proposed approach. We also carry out a detailed evaluation of the numerical stability of likelihood evaluation and parameter estimation, which underscores the robustness of the method in practical applications. For empirical validation, we analyse demographic data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD), while the extension to the bivariate case and additional technical details are provided in the online supplementary material.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Muscle-strengthening activities (MSAs) like resistance training are a cornerstone of physical activity guidelines. Aim To extend previous research on MSAs practices (beyond MSAs frequency) and barriers to MSAs. Methods A convenience sample completed a cross-sectional online survey. The survey included a questionnaire that assessed whether participants engaged in MSAs, which type(s) of resistance they used (e.g., free weights, bodyweight), and whether they performed them according to the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline on ≥ 2 days/week, at moderate or greater intensity, and involving all major muscle groups. Participants who did not engage in MSAs were asked about barriers. Results Valid data were available for 351 adults (mean age = 31.8 ± 14.9 years; 51.9% females), of which 242 (68.9%) reported engaging in MSAs, and 80 (22.8%) met the WHO guideline on MSAs. Bodyweight was the most-utilized type of resistance (77.7%), followed by free weights (62.4%), machines (61.6%), and resistance bands (19.4%). A lack of time and having no specific reason were the most-reported barriers (33.0% each), followed by a lack of enjoyment (26.6%). Sociodemographic factors associated with practices of and barriers to MSAs were identified. Conclusions Fewer than one in four persons from a physically active sample met the WHO guideline on MSAs. Promoting resistance bands as an underutilized type of resistance might prove useful for increasing engagement in MSAs. Informing individuals about the health benefits of MSAs and providing time-efficient and enjoyable MSAs protocols appears important to address the most common barriers.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Untreated hypertension is a risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, this association is not well understood. The aim of this study was to reveal protein signatures that bridge the pathophysiological changes in hypertension to AD. Using untargeted proteomics, we analyzed brain samples from aged (30- and 40-week-old) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs, n = 12), and age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY, n = 8) controls, and human AD patients (Braak stages 4–6) ( n = 30), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) ( n = 5), non-demented controls (Braak stages 0–3) ( n = 37). Differential expression and pathway analyses in SHRs highlighted the ‘extracellular exosome’ pathway. This pathway also showed significant associations to differentially expressed proteins in AD and CAA patients. Comparison between species identified 24 proteins in SHRs and AD, whose trajectory pattern over the progression of hypertension, aligned with those observed during AD Braak stage progression, compared to respective controls. The proteins were similarly associated with extracellular exosomes. Immunostaining and spatial proteomics support vesicle accumulation and dysregulated exosome protein signatures in the cerebrovasculature of both SHR and AD brains. Additionally, the extracellular exosome pathway-association was not identified in a traditional model of familial AD (5xFAD). Our findings demonstrate cross-species translatability between AD and the SHR and provide novel mechanistic insights into a shared dysregulation of cerebral artery-associated exosomes.

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study examined social networks and self-regulation in two different co-creation environments (2D digital and 3D VR co-creation) through SNA and ANCOVA. The study utilized a quasi-experimental research design with 44 tenth-grade students, 24 males (55%) and 20 females (45%), from an English class at a public senior high school in northern Taiwan. To assess the effects of the environment, the classes were divided into a control group and an experimental group, with a valid sample of 22 in each group. As the results showed, 3D VR co-creation manifested more restricted social networks with fewer cliques but higher cohesiveness, reciprocity and betweenness. This suggests not only greater community solidarity and stability in 3D VR co-creation but also greater needs of 3D VR co-creators for interconnection when facing the novelty effect. Such dependence on interaction corroborated the dominance of lower-level cognitive strategies in 3D VR communities and echoed the ANCOVA results showing that strategy use was the most prominent self-regulatory skill in 3D VR co-creation. The limitation on gender composition was specified. Further implications are discussed, and suggestions for increased co-creation time, coworking strategies, and the development of a predictive model as scaffolding are offered.",

    "Abstract": "This study sought to compare the clinical outcomes of left total knee arthroplasty performed under robotic assistance by right-handed surgeons of differing experience levels, and to assess how such technology may improve operative precision and mitigate experience-related variations in results. A retrospective review was performed for 120 patients suffering from left knee osteoarthritis, all of whom received total knee arthroplasty from December 2020 to June 2025. Patients were divided into Group A (senior surgeons, > 10 years of experience) and Group B (junior surgeons, < 2 years of experience), each comprising 60 patients. Each group was further subdivided into robot-assisted total knee arthroplasty (RTKA) and conventional total knee arthroplasty (CTKA) subgroups, with 30 patients in each. Recorded parameters included operative time, incision length, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative hip-knee-ankle (HKA) angle, sagittal and coronal tibial and femoral component angles (LTC, FTC, LFC, FFC), as well as Knee Society Score (KSS), visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, range of motion (ROM), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores on postoperative days 3 and 90. Complication rates were also compared. The results showed that while senior surgeons had shorter operative times and better early radiographic outcomes in conventional TKA, robotic assistance significantly improved component alignment and early clinical scores for junior surgeons, resulting in no statistically significant inter-group differences. in both radiographic and clinical outcomes. Notably, in the RTKA subgroups, there were no statistically significant disparities noted in operative outcomes when comparing procedures performed by senior and junior surgeons in any intraoperative, radiographic, or clinical parameters. Additionally, junior surgeons performing conventional left TKA had a higher incidence of femoral anterior cortical notching (NOTCH). In conclusion, robot-assisted left total knee arthroplasty enhances procedural consistency and reduces the performance gap between surgeons of different experience levels, particularly aiding junior right-handed surgeons in overcoming technical challenges associated with non-dominant side surgery, thereby showing potential to promote greater consistency in surgical outcomes and patient safety.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) with neck dissection has emerged as an organ-preserving treatment for hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC), but long-term evidence remains limited. This retrospective study evaluated oncologic outcomes, prognostic factors, mortality patterns, and organ preservation in patients with T1–T3 HPSCC. From October 2010 to August 2023, 48 patients without prior upper aerodigestive tract malignancy or irradiation underwent TORS with neck dissection, with or without cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemoradiation. Tumor stages included T1 (37.5%), T2 (45.8%), and T3 (16.7%), and en bloc resection was achieved in all cases. Pathologic analysis revealed lymph node metastasis in 46.8% and extranodal extension in 17%. Radiotherapy to the primary hypopharynx was omitted in 60% of patients; when administered, the mean dose was approximately 60 Gy. After a mean follow-up of 5.9 ± 3.5 years, 5- and 10-year recurrence-free survival rates were both 69%, while disease-specific survival rates were 77%. Overall survival at 5 and 10 years was 77% and 59%, respectively. Survival and recurrence were significantly associated with extranodal extension in multivariable analysis ( p &lt; 0.05). Of 15 deaths, distant metastases (46.7%) and second primary malignancies (33.3%) were predominant, whereas local recurrence accounted for only 13.3%. TORS with neck dissection provides durable disease control and excellent organ preservation for T1–T3 HPSCC, allowing radiotherapy omission in selected patients, although distant metastases and secondary cancers remain major causes of late mortality.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study examines the impact of innovative capacity and socioemotional wealth (SEW) on the well-being of CEOs in family businesses. Due to the critical role of family firms in global economies, this study integrates the dynamic capabilities framework with the SEW theory to explore their combined effects. Using a quantitative methodology, data were collected from 120 CEOs of Spanish family businesses through a structured survey. Results confirmed that innovative capacity positively influences the well-being of CEOs by enhancing organisational adaptability and competitive advantage. Additionally, SEW, encompassing emotional attachment, identity, and legacy, contributes significantly to CEO satisfaction.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose of Review Takotsubo syndrome (TTS), also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is an acute and transient form of myocardial dysfunction that predominantly affects postmenopausal women after emotional or physical stress. Although initially considered benign, growing evidence demonstrates that TTS carries substantial morbidity, recurrence, and mortality risks. This review aims to summarize current knowledge on the pathophysiology of TTS with a focus on inflammation, to explore the interplay between stress and myocardial injury, and to discuss the diagnostic and prognostic value of multimodality imaging together with emerging therapeutic approaches, providing a comprehensive framework for clinical practice and future research. Recent Findings The pathophysiology of TTS is multifactorial, involving sympathetic hyperactivation with catecholamine excess, microvascular dysfunction, epicardial coronary spasm, intracellular calcium overload, and myocardial stunning. Increasing evidence supports a central role of inflammation, including activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, release of cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, oxidative stress, and macrophage polarization, ultimately leading to myocardial injury, fibrosis, and adverse ventricular remodelling. Multimodality imaging, comprising echocardiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, and nuclear techniques, enables early identification of functional and structural abnormalities, exclusion of differential diagnoses such as acute coronary syndromes or myocarditis, and prognostic assessment. Summary TTS represents a complex stress-related cardiomyopathy with overlapping neurohormonal, inflammatory, and microvascular mechanisms. Current management remains largely supportive, focused on heart failure therapy, anticoagulation when indicated, and hemodynamic stabilization. Novel therapies targeting inflammatory and sympathetic pathways are under investigation and may change the future management of this condition. Understanding the interplay between stress, inflammation, and myocardial injury offers new opportunities for pathophysiology-driven treatment strategies and improved patient outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Goat milk cheese production is gaining attention due to its nutritional value and potential for niche markets. However, technological challenges, mainly curd fragility and low yield, often limit large-scale processing and quality standardization. Thus, this study investigated the use of ultrasound (US) during milk coagulation as a strategy to enhance curd formation and cheese-making efficiency. The impact of US on recombinant chymosin activity was first assessed, showing that short sonication (5 min at 30 °C) increased proteolytic activity by up to 92% and milk-clotting activity by 22% ( p &lt; 0.05). During coagulation, US reduced rennet coagulation time by up to 10%. Partial US-assisted coagulation (8 and 16 min) increased spontaneous syneresis (from 2 to 7% after 40 min), reduced curd mass loss during drainage (≤ 34%), and enhanced solid retention in the gel (up to 45% reduction in whey solids). These effects resulted in cheeses with higher yield (up to 39.5%) and increased protein (≤ 5%) and fat content (≤ 11%). Compared with the control cheese, those produced with US intervention exhibited higher proteolysis, greater elastic modulus, and improved elasticity after 21 days at 7 °C, without significant changes in pH, acidity, or color. Therefore, partial US-assisted coagulation (8 and 16 min) enhanced recombinant chymosin activity and induced colloidal changes in the milk matrix, contributing to improved coagulation efficiency and technological properties of fresh goat cheese, including higher yield, greater solids retention, and better texture. These findings highlight ultrasound as a promising tool to optimize goat cheese production and improve process efficiency in the dairy industry.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The rapid expansion of Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks and their integration with cloud technologies have led to the emergence of Cloud MANET, a network model that combines the flexibility of MANET with the scalability and computing abilities of cloud technologies. In such a model, several MANET can be combined into one using connection to the cloud. However, frequent node mobility in such networks results in periodic topology changes and link instability, reducing data delivery rates and increasing end-to-end latency. This negatively impacts packet delivery within Cloud MANET, especially in real-time applications. In this paper, a novel routing scheme is proposed that uses machine learning techniques, it presents an extension of the AODV reactive routing protocol, called AODV-KNN, which uses the K-nearest neighbor algorithm and fitness functions. The purpose of this modifying routing scheme was to improve route discovery, reduce latency, and increase network stability. The article also analyzed the impact of fitness function coefficients on routing in Cloud MANET. For different environments, coefficients were selected to show improvements in the measured metrics. The basic quality of service metrics used to evaluate the proposed routing algorithm were packet delivery ratio, packet loss ratio, number of routing packets, average throughput and end-to-end delay. A comparative analysis demonstrates the advantages of AODV-KNN routing over traditional approaches in dynamic network environments.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor in adults, with its significant inter- and intra-tumoral heterogeneity being a major factor in its treatment resistance and overall prognosis. GB diagnosis typically involves magnetic resonance imaging, confirmed by histology after surgical resection or biopsy. Recurrence is almost expected despite adjuvant therapies. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) may represent promising cancer biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic monitoring. Methods In this work, we monitored 21 GB patients at different time intervals performing a quantitative and dimensional analysis of plasma-derived EVs, with the aim of finding correlations with their clinical course. Results Our analyses revealed a slight correlation with patients’ clinical conditions during follow-up, such as tumor time recurrence over time, but no significant difference in plasma EV concentration in GB patients and healthy control subjects (HC), contrary to previously published data. Conclusions Although based on a limited number of patients, our methodological study highlights the need for a universal analysis method to compare data from large patient populations in order to use EVs as a biomarker for the diagnosis of recurrence by liquid biopsy, especially in GB, a tumor known for its heterogeneity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract To develop a predictive model for optimal anastomosis sizing in TAPVC surgery, focusing on the role of pulmonary venous confluence (PVC) size. A patient-specific fluid–structure interaction (FSI) model simulated blood flow through various anastomosis sizes. Key variables included body weight, anastomosis length, and PVC size. The model's predictions were validated against postoperative echocardiographic measurements from nine TAPVC cases. A strong positive correlation was found between flow velocity and the ratio of body weight to anastomosis length and PVC circumference. Including PVC size significantly improved predictive accuracy. No significant difference was observed between predicted and measured velocities. PVC size is a critical factor for planning TAPVC surgery. Incorporating it into computational models enhances the prediction of flow dynamics and supports personalized surgical decision-making. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This research presents a metallographic study of an archaeological iron knife from the Nubian civilization. The study aims to characterize the structural and chemical composition of the metal, analyze the morphology and formation mechanisms of corrosion products, and, finally, conduct a treatment and conservation plan based on the obtained results. Several analytical and investigative techniques were employed, including scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDX), reflected-light microscopy (RLM), portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF), micro-Raman spectroscopy, and USB digital microscopy. The results revealed that the knife was made of bloomery wrought iron, predominantly consisting of the ferrite phase, with slag inclusions dispersed throughout the structure. Furthermore, the investigation revealed the presence of an incomplete and irregular pearlite phase and the twinning phenomenon, which is uncommon feature of BCC structures in general and ferrite iron in particular. Despite being buried in soil for a long time, the artifact exhibited an unusually good state of preservation, lacking typical corrosion morphologies. The corrosion appeared as a powdery superficial layer on a well-preserved original surface. Iron oxides and hydroxides, typically accompanying excavated iron artifacts, were identified. The knife’s exceptional preservation is largely attributed to the dry environmental conditions of Nubia, which limited the electrochemical activity necessary for severe corrosion. These findings provide valuable insights into the preservation mechanisms of iron artifacts in arid burial environments. Finally, the obtained results were used to carry out conservation and protection procedures for the artifact.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract During the Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO; 17–15 Ma), the northern boundary of mangroves–now situated at ~30° N–extended along the northern Mediterranean-Paratethyan (M-P) coasts (~45° N). These Avicennia -only mangroves have been considered impoverished mangroves controlled by the general latitudinal temperature gradient. They have also been compared with the extant Middle East (ME) mangroves around the Arabian Peninsula, characterised by the dominance of Avicennia and their low diversity. However, these extant communities are not a latitudinal feature but rather an anomaly shaped by extreme environmental conditions (aridity, hypersalinity, sediment supply) that only a few mangrove species can tolerate. In contrast, reconstructed palaeoenvironments for MCO M-P mangroves indicate mild rainy climates. Currently, Avicennia (represented by A. marina ) is mainly tropical and its latitudinal boundaries are characterised by warm-temperate, humid climates with frost-free mild winters. We conclude that current ME mangroves cannot be considered modern analogues for the MCO M-P mangroves. Finding such modern analogues is challenging, and further studies are recommended to uncover their ecological and biogeographical patterns.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Anisakis simplex complex is a major causative agent of human anisakiasis, but species composition and tissue distribution, including intra-vitam muscle parasitism, remain unclear. We investigated the prevalence and tissue localization of Anisakis larvae in live-caught Pacific chub mackerel ( Scomber japonicus ) from four Japanese regions. A high-resolution melting (HRM) assay targeting the ITS region enabled high-throughput discrimination of A. simplex sensu stricto (s.s.), A. pegreffii , A. berlandi , and A. simplex s.s. × A. pegreffii hybrids. In Iwate and Shizuoka (Pacific coast), A. simplex s.s. was predominant in both viscera and muscle tissues, with a positive correlation between tissue burdens and a ventral bias of muscle larvae. In Fukui (Sea of Japan), overall prevalence was high, and the viscera showed a mixed sibling-species composition, whereas muscle larvae were predominantly A. simplex s.s. In Nagasaki (East China Sea), A. pegreffii dominated the viscera, but only A. simplex s.s. occurred in muscle. These findings indicate that A. simplex s.s. can parasitize muscle of live mackerel and that heavier visceral infections are associated with greater muscle involvement. This study underscores the importance of sibling-species monitoring, proper cold-chain and evisceration management, and HRM assays for effective surveillance to mitigate anisakiasis risk.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Water treatment plants commonly deliver water that often contains some contaminants at levels exceeding permitted limits. Adsorption is an efficient and low-cost method for removing metal ions, although it is not widely applied on a large scale. Significant research is being conducted on alternatives that facilitate the use of lignocellulose adsorbents for this purpose. The aim of this study was to determine parameters for sizing a filter to remove impurities from the water supply using lignocellulosic adsorbents in a fixed bed column. The adsorption capacities of banana peel fiber, coconut shell, and coffee grounds for manganese ions were evaluated and compared to select the most effective adsorbent. The banana peel fiber demonstrated significantly superior performance and was selected for further investigation. The concentration of manganese in the solutions was measured using an Energy Dispersion X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (EDXRF). The kinetics of adsorption were fitted to the pseudo-second-order model, while the Langmuir isothermal model was used to determine adsorption capacity. Additionally, the Thomas model was applied to describe the behavior of the fixed bed column for Mn 2 ⁺ ions. The maximum adsorption capacity of the banana peel fiber for Mn 2 ⁺ was found to be 6.17 mg L⁻ 1 , utilizing 940 g of banana adsorbent in a column that was 30 cm high and 12 cm in diameter, with a flow rate of 238 L d⁻ 1 . An estimated service time of 84 days was calculated. A proposal was made outlining operational parameters for water filtration on a domestic scale, with a capacity of approximately 20 m 3 of water.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Emerging contaminants pose significant risks to environmental and human health, warranting detailed investigation. Among these contaminants, pharmaceuticals and their metabolites are of particular concern, as they are widely released into the ecosystem. Their chemical and biological stability contributes to their persistence in aquatic systems and limits the effectiveness of conventional water treatment technologies. Adsorption is one of the most commonly used advanced treatment techniques for removing pharmaceuticals due to its favorable operation and cost-effectiveness. The use of adsorbents obtained through biotechnological processes has emerged as a promising approach due to their efficiency and environmental sustainability. Promising biotechnological adsorbents include live microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria, and microalgae. Dead or inactive biomass also shows applicability, being considered lower in cost. Additionally, algae and adsorbents based on natural polymers obtained through biotechnological processes, such as sodium alginate, bacterial cellulose, and chitosan, stand out. Biocomposites enable the combination of desirable characteristics from more than one material, resulting in adsorbents with better performance and lower environmental impact compared to conventional alternatives. Moreover, adsorption processes employing biocomposites often operate under mild conditions, such as neutral pH and ambient temperature, further increasing their applicability. Thus, this literature review aims to explore the application of adsorption processes for the removal of pharmaceuticals from water using adsorbents derived from biotechnological processes.",

Irradiation times of 60, 120, and 180 min were used with a TiO 2 loading of 0.6 g L −1 . Under these conditions, only ~ 20% diclofenac degradation and 50% COD removal were achieved, indicating relatively low treatment efficiency. Cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and cytokinesis assays with Allium cepa did not reveal statistically significant toxic effects; however, some genotoxic responses were observed. Overall, no clear evidence of transformation products more harmful than the parent compound was detected, although this result should be interpreted with caution, given the observed genotoxic responses. Overall, heterogeneous photocatalysis exhibited limited performance under the tested conditions.

Fast Fourier transform (FFT) was applied to current and voltage signals to identify the most efficient pulse characteristics, droplet detachment behavior, and transfer frequency. An analytical formulation correlating wire feed rate, travel speed, and bead cross-sectional area was used to guide the selection of deposition parameters. In addition, a theoretical analysis of bead overlap was developed and its predictions were directly compared with experimental results, demonstrating good agreement and validating the proposed model. These strategies defined a stable working window with voltage between 22 and 28 V and current between 190 and 220 A. The optimal condition was obtained at a frequency of 240 Hz. The proposed methodology enables parameter adaptation for different materials, ensuring energy efficiency, cost reduction, and geometric consistency. Moreover, GMAW-P allows the production of high-quality deposits at lower current levels compared to conventional GMAW.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The school-based professional experience practicum is an integral part of a teacher education degree, providing pre-service teachers with authentic opportunities to develop their practice. However, the assessment of this practicum experience often fails to capture key non-academic attributes that are relevant for teacher competency. This paper reports on a collaboration between a university and a secondary school to co-develop enhanced practicum reporting parameters. Drawing on a published framework for candidate selection into ITE programs, the revised report foregrounds professional capabilities that extend beyond those outlined in the Australian Professional Standards for Teachers. The aim was to embed valued character-based attributes within the practicum assessment to support school-based mentors in identifying and nurturing these qualities in pre-service teachers. The findings highlight the value of stakeholder collaboration in designing assessment tools that better reflect the complexities of teaching and the multifaceted nature of teacher professionalism. Implications are discussed for supporting the development of pre-service teachers through more comprehensive and contextually relevant assessment practices.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Organic optoelectronic devices demonstrate immense potential in flexible displays, wearable electronics, and artificial skin, needing precise light-field and morphology management strategies to further improve their opto-electric performance. Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) has emerged as a high-resolution, high-efficiency, and low-cost patterning technique that mechanically transferring micro/nanoscale patterns from a template to a substrate to significantly enhance the optoelectronic performance through the precise creation of advanced light-management structures, combined with additional solid-state stacking morphology. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in NIL technology for organic optoelectronics. It begins with an introduction to the fundamental principles, main process variants (thermal, ultraviolet, and electrochemical NIL), as well as key technical issues. Subsequently, through specific applications in organic light-emitting diodes, organic solar cells, and organic field-effect transistors, it highlights the exceptional capabilities of NIL to enhance device performance by controlling crystallization and creating functional micro/nanostructuring. Specific advantages include enabling high-efficiency light management to overcome efficiency bottlenecks, facilitating low-cost, high-throughput manufacturing for industrialization, full compatibility with flexible substrates for emerging applications, enabling multifunctional integration and novel device architectures, and tailoring material microstructures and properties advance fundamental research. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges and future prospects of NIL in integrated organic optoelectronic systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Heavy-metal contamination remains a critical environmental issue due to the persistence and toxicity of metals such as Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, and Mn. Agricultural waste–derived biosorbents have emerged as cost-effective and sustainable alternatives to conventional treatment methods, with clear performance differences across materials. Rice husk typically achieves 75–90% removal with adsorption capacities of 60–150 mg g⁻¹ and retains around 70–80% efficiency after 4–5 regeneration cycles, while banana peel commonly shows 80–95% removal with higher capacities of 80–180 mg g⁻¹ and maintains 75–85% efficiency across 3–4 cycles. Sugarcane bagasse offers 70–88% removal with capacities of 50–140 mg g⁻¹ and remains effective for up to four cycles, particularly when chemically modified. Chemical modification often enhances biosorption efficiency, with many agro-waste materials showing 1.5–3-fold improvements in adsorption capacity compared with their raw forms. This review integrates these comparative trends by analysing adsorption performance, the influence of chemical and physical modification, kinetic and isotherm behaviour, and regeneration efficiency to provide a clear picture of biosorption potential across agro-waste materials. By highlighting biosorbents that combine efficiency, stability, affordability, and reusability, the review supports the identification of candidates suitable for practical heavy-metal remediation. Further studies are required to evaluate biosorbents using real wastewater, optimise biomass characteristics and operating conditions, and improve regeneration and safe handling of spent materials so that biosorption can progress toward reliable large-scale application.

This study aims to document, for the first time, the occurrence of C. brasiliensis on Butia odorata (Barb. Rodr.) Noblick (Arecaceae) in the municipality of Piracicaba, São Paulo State, Brazil. The identity of the specimens was verified through both morphological and molecular analyses, specifically examining the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). The haplotype of the specimen collected on Butia palm tree exhibited over 99% homology with other sequences of C. brasiliensis , thereby confirming the species identity. Observations indicated a clear preference of the aphid for the rachillae and fruits of B. odorata . Additionally, for the first time, a mutualistic interaction between Camponotus crassus Mayr (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and the palm aphid was documented. Currently, C. brasiliensis is known to associate with species from four botanical families, with a predominant occurrence in Arecaceae throughout South America.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Biochar has emerged as an environmentally sustainable material for addressing agri-environmental issues owing to its porous structure, versatile surface chemistry, and stability. While pristine biochars have demonstrated effectiveness in various applications, ranging from agricultural soil enhancement to contaminant immobilization, their performance is often constrained by insufficient reactivity and limited selectivity. This review begins by outlining the biochar production process, emphasizing how key factors influence its physicochemical properties and overall performance. A major barrier to practical deployment is the difficulty of recovering fine biochar particles from treated media, often requiring energy-intensive methods, which limits the scalability for agri-environmental applications. To overcome these constraints, the review explores various biochar modification methods, focusing on magnetization and mineral impregnation techniques. As such, magnetic biochars (MBCs) not only retain the adsorptive benefits of carbonaceous materials but also enable facile recovery via external magnetic fields, addressing a major obstacle in post-treatment separation. In addition, the mineral doping of MBCs further enhances surface functionality and reactivity, improving removal efficiencies for a wide spectrum of pollutants. This review critically explores the synthesis routes, structural characteristics, and functional performance of magnetized and mineral-enriched biochars, with an emphasis on their applications in environmental remediation and soil enrichment. Mechanistic insights into adsorption pathways including pore-filling, electrostatic binding, and surface complexation are detailed, along with emerging approaches involving light-assisted degradation pathways. By synthesizing laboratory findings and field-scale observations, this review identifies current improvements and limitations, and outlines key directions for future research toward the practical and scalable use of engineered biochars for more sustainable agri-environmental applications.

    "Abstract": "Abstract The paper starts by reviewing the post-Keynesian analysis of the formation of the euro, indicating the concerns over the imposition of common fiscal policies across the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) countries, the likely deflationary effects, and constraints on counter-cyclical fiscal policy. Scepticism was expressed over the role of the European Central Bank (ECB) and its relationships with national governments in terms of the financing of government expenditure and its abilities to achieve a harmonised inflation target across all countries. It is argued that the issues identified by post-Keynesian (and other) authors have haunted the governance of the euro area and in a number of cases and that corresponding policy shifts have intensified these problems. The developments over budget deficits and national debt in the EMU are mapped out. It broadly suggests a tightening of the deflationary nature of the rules, particularly regarding the excessive deficit procedures, and the shift of emphasis from deficit to debt. The adoption of the ‘structural budget’ and its reliance on ‘potential output’ raise further problematics. Section 5 relates to the role of the ECB and monetary policy, and the relationship between ECB and national governments. Section 6 explores the responses of the authorities to the euro and other crises. Section 7 is a concluding section in which we discuss how far our fears on the euro were realised, and the struggles to address issues.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Construction and demolition waste (C&amp;DW) remains a major sustainability challenge, particularly in developing countries where reliable empirical measurements of material losses are scarce. This study examines construction material waste in Egypt using a mixed-methods approach, primarily based on stakeholder perspectives, with supplementary validation from actual project records. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining a structured questionnaire distributed to 250 professionals (113 responses) with validation using actual data from two bridge projects and one commercial building. Fourteen commonly used construction materials were assessed, with estimation indicating waste rates between 5% and 9%. The highest losses were reported for sand (8.56%), mortar (8.13%), and masonry (7.94%), while reinforcement steel showed comparatively lower losses (5.15%). Contractors and subcontractors were reported as the main contributors to waste generation, although both contractors and owners were identified as key actors capable of reducing waste. Respondents also indicated moderate awareness and slightly positive attitudes toward waste-related regulations. Participants estimated that improved site controls and enhanced management practices could reduce overall waste levels by approximately 27%. Despite limited project-based validation, the findings provide useful insights that emphasize the need for targeted improvements in resource efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Rare diseases (RD) produce an important public health impact, but their specific morbimortality burden remains unknown. Based on Death Certificates (1997–2017), the secular trend (ST) and spatial distribution of deaths due to RD are analyzed. Methods The ICD-10 classified Death Certificates were obtained from the Ministry of Health. A Python web scraper was developed to query the orpha.net web catalogue to establish a correspondence between Orpha and ICD-10 codes. The RDs mortality rate per 1,000 deaths (RD*1000) was calculated by sex, age groups, and by ICD-10 chapters for the five regions of Argentina (Northwest, Northeast, Centro, Cuyo, and Patagonia), as well as for its 24 provinces and 513 departments. Secular trend (ST) was analyzed using Joinpoint software, while spatiality was assessed through Moran’s and LISA indices. Results The RD*1000 death rate at country level was 189.4. Patagonia exhibited the highest rate, followed by Cuyo, Centro, Northeast and Northwest, being these conditions higher in women. The ST was negative between 1997 and 2009 and positive between 2009 and 2017. The geographical distribution of the clusters exhibiting high and low rates was mainly observed in the central and northern regions of the country, respectively. According to ICD-10, the prevalent categories were neoplasms, followed by eye diseases, congenital malformations, diseases of the nervous and digestive systems and diseases of the blood. Conclusion The geographical distribution of RD deaths in Argentina exhibits significant heterogeneity, characterized by a latitudinal arrangement. This phenomenon can be attributed to socioeconomic inequalities, intricately linked to population dynamics and migratory patterns. Clinical trial registration Not applicable. This study involved the analysis of secondary data and did not require clinical trial registration.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This methodological paper investigates the viability of using Large Languages Models (LLMs) for the use of qualitative coding of posts to Facebook groups for science teachers. Categories for the coding, and the corresponding prompt for the LLMs, were engineered using an iterative process on progressively larger data sets, whilst checking consistency with human expert coders at each step. Three different versions of OpenAI’s LLMs were used; GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o, to also investigate the difference in performance between the different versions. The LLMs performed consistently well in qualitative coding, showing moderate to good agreement with human coders. This performance remained strong even when applied to datasets outside the prompt’s original design. Agreement of the LLMs with the human coders was slightly below human–human agreement levels for the two older LLMs, whereas the most recent LLM, GPT4o, achieved an inter-coder reliability that matched that of the human coders. This study proposes several possible strategies for the integration of LLMs into qualitative coding workflows, as well as offering suggestions to improve LLM performance through prompt engineering.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract To address the long-standing professional knowledge bottlenecks in scientific marine research and aquaculture, this paper proposes a marine reasoning large language model construction framework based on structured reasoning chain-of-thought (SRCoT) fine-tuning and a knowledge graph (KG). To implement the framework, an indent-driven article heuristic search method is first adopted to construct a marine-domain-specific dataset, followed by the development of a sliding window and weight-matrix-based strategy for dataset deduplication. Subsequently, a marine-domain KG is constructed, and an entity entailment method based on pointwise mutual information vectors is designed. Finally, a model post-training approach integrating SRCoT and three-stage direct preference optimization (DPO) is proposed. The base model is fine-tuned on the marine-domain SRCoT dataset and post-trained using the three-stage DPO strategy. During deployment, the custom-built marine-domain KG is used as an external reference to enhance the model responses. The experimental results demonstrate that the model trained with the proposed framework achieves performance improvements in marine-domain complex reasoning tasks and is effective in mitigating over-reasoning and refining model responses.",

Rather than presenting forest as co-teacher as a conceptual claim, this work animates these ideas through lived stories in which acorns, fungi, winds and fire participate in teaching alongside children, parents and educators. Grounded in Indigenous epistemologies that recognise land as first teacher, posthumanist notions of intra-action and ecofeminist ethics of care, this study develops Situated Forest Inquiry as a methodology of relational accountability between human and more-than-human worlds. The findings illustrate how forest pedagogies can redefine care, enact species interdependence, nurture multispecies kinship and deepen engagement with Indigenous knowledge, offering educators clear examples of how environmental education might be practiced differently.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract It is well known that the amount of damage caused by lightning strikes to protected composite airframe structures depends on the paint characteristics, often applied on the surface of composite structures to protect from environmental effects and to personalise a product. In this work, physically based models of the mechanical loads induced by lightning strikes are employed in the generation of the mechanical overpressure fields due to a simulated lightning strike, while accounting for the paint thickness. These fields are then implemented into a three-dimensional finite element framework and combined with a damage model to predict the effect of paint thickness on the mechanical damage in composite structures subjected to this type of events. These models accurately predict the increase of damage extent with the increase of paint thickness, which is corroborated by experimental observations from industry and by the experimentally observed trends reported in literature.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Canada is widely regarded as a pro-arbitration jurisdiction. Yet the role of domestic judges in investor-state dispute settlement remains significant, particularly in arbitrations that do not take place at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). Unlike ICSID, which provides a self-contained system for enforcement and annulment, investment treaty arbitration conducted under other arbitration rules are subject to judicial oversight. This article examines how Canadian judges have approached set-aside proceedings in non-ICSID cases, with a particular focus on the standard of review applied under Article 34 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration. The article contends that Canadian judges play a pivotal role in shaping the interface between international investment law and domestic legal principles. In this context, this article argues that the degree of deference shown by Canadian judges to investment arbitral awards should be understood not as judicial restraint per se but, rather, as respect for the distinct legal order constituted by investment treaty arbitration and the UNCITRAL Model Law — a legal order that is international in nature and grounded in a shared global understanding of review standards. Through an analysis of key judicial decisions reviewing investment awards — specifically, the North American Free Trade Agreement Chapter 11 awards, this study explores the extent to which Canadian judges have embraced an internationalist perspective. The article concludes that, while Canadian judges claim to be pro-arbitration, this does not necessarily equate to deference towards investment arbitral awards.",

    "Abstract": "The mixing mechanism within a single vortex has been a theoretical focus for decades, while it remains unclear especially under the variable-density (VD) scenario. This study investigates canonical single-vortex VD mixing in shock–bubble interactions (SBI) through high-resolution numerical simulations. Special attention is paid to examining the stretching dynamics and its impact on VD mixing within a single vortex, and this problem is investigated by quantitatively characterising the scalar dissipation rate (SDR), namely the mixing rate, and its time integral, referred to as mixedness. To study VD mixing, we first examine single-vortex passive-scalar (PS) mixing with the absence of a density difference. Mixing originates from diffusion and is further enhanced by the stretching dynamics. Under the axisymmetry and zero diffusion assumptions, the single-vortex stretching rate illustrates an algebraic growth of the length of scalar strips over time. By incorporating the diffusion process through the solution of the advection–diffusion equation along these stretched scalar strips, a PS mixing model for SDR is proposed based on the single-vortex algebraic stretching characteristic. Within this framework, density-gradient effects from two perspectives of the stretching dynamics and diffusion process are discovered to challenge the extension of the PS mixing model to VD mixing. First, the secondary baroclinic effect increases the VD stretching rate by the additional secondary baroclinic principal strain, while the algebraic stretching characteristic is still retained. Second, the density source effect, originating from the intrinsic nature of the density difference in the multi-component transport equation, suppresses the diffusion process. By accounting for both the secondary baroclinic effect on stretching and the density source effect on diffusion, a VD mixing model for SBI is further modified. This model establishes a quantitative relationship between the stretching dynamics and the evolution of the mixing rate and mixedness for single-vortex VD mixing over a broad range of Mach numbers. Furthermore, the essential role of the stretching dynamics on the mixing rate is demonstrated by the derived dependence of the time-averaged mixing rate $\\overline {\\langle \\chi \\rangle }$ on the Péclet number ${\\textit{Pe}}$ , which scales as $\\overline {\\langle \\chi \\rangle } \\sim {\\textit{Pe}}^{{2}/{3}}$ .",

    "Abstract": "In the fully developed region of a plane turbulent wall jet, the key jet parameters, including the jet velocity U m , jet half-width z 1/2 and wall shear stress $ \\tau_{0}$ , follow the classical power-law scaling with the streamwise distance x : U m $v$ / M 0 ∼ ( xM 0 / $v$ 2 ) − α , z 1/2 M 0 / $v$ 2 ∼ ( xM 0 / $v$ 2 ) β and $ \\tau_{0}$ $v$ 2 /( ρ $M_{0}^{2}$ ) ∼ ( xM 0 / $v$ 2 ) − χ , where M 0 is the source kinematic momentum flux, $v$ is the coefficient of kinematic viscosity of fluid, ρ is the mass density of fluid and α , β and χ are the positive scaling exponents. We present a theoretical framework to determine these exponents. Our framework reveals that each jet parameter exhibits a scaling transition. This transition is driven by a shift in the scaling law of the skin-friction coefficient as the Reynolds number Re m = U m z m / $v$ changes over from Re m &lt; 8000 to Re m &gt; 10 000, where z m is the wall-normal location corresponding to the jet velocity. Specifically, α transitions from 4(1 + γ )/(9 − γ ) to 13(1 + γ )/[2(14 − γ )], β from 8/(9 − γ ) to 13/(14 − γ ) and χ from (9 + 7 γ )/(9 − γ ) to (14 + 12 γ )/(14 − γ ), where γ ≈ 0.05 is a parameter determined from experiments. We validate the theoretical predictions against extensive experimental datasets from the literature.",

    "Abstract": "Predicting unsteady loads on plate-like objects during unsteady motion is important in many applications, such as ship manoeuvring, flight and biological propulsion. The drag force on a starting plate that moves normal to its surface can be severely underestimated during the acceleration phase when conventional methods are used to incorporate the effects of acceleration. These methods often introduce an inviscid added mass force that has its origin in potential flow. However, the flow field around a starting plate quickly diverges from potential flow after the start of the motion due to the continuous creation of vorticity at the plate surface. Following the concept of drag by Burgers (1921 Proc. K. Ned. Akad. Wet. 23, 774–782), we propose a model to predict the creation of vorticity on the plate surface and its advection into the vortex loop at the plate edges, based on Stokes’ first problem. This model shows that the acceleration drag force is a history force, in contrast to the inviscid added mass force that is proportional to the instantaneous acceleration of the plate. We perform experiments on starting plates over a large range of accelerations, velocities, fluid viscosities and plate geometries for which the model gives accurate predictions for the drag force during acceleration and during the relaxation phase immediately after the acceleration ceases. This model is extended to also predict the drag forces on accelerating plates during a starting motion with a non-constant acceleration.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract When Vietnamese refugees came to the Gulf Coast they were attracted to the region, in part, because of the fishing industry. But their entry into the fishery created friction with white fishers who had fished those waters for years. This friction would result in violence. This article anchors this history in the marine environment of coastal Texas. Many white fishers objected to Vietnamese resettlement because of how the Vietnamese fished. Local fishers had, for years, worried about the fisheries given decades of overfishing and pollution. In this context, white fishers weaponized these very real anxieties to argue that the Vietnamese were a threat to the coastal ecosystem. This threat the Vietnamese supposedly posed to these waters, along with the racism and xenophobia of white fishers, accounted for the depth of division and the degree of violence along the coast of Texas during the late 1970s and early 1980s.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Understanding the local to regional history of extreme events such as debris flows and floods provides context to plan for and mitigate these hazards to life, property, and infrastructure. The Klamath Mountains of northwestern California have experienced both debris flows and devastating wildfires. Whiskeytown National Recreation Area (WHIS) is at the heart of this range and has a wealth of debris flow–related landforms. Gaining an understanding of prehistoric flows and their relationship with fire or other potential triggers can help mitigate future problems. Optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon analyses from sediment and entrained organics in undisturbed facies, including beneath partially buried boulders, establishes a chronology of paleo-events in WHIS. The levee deposits indicate a repetition of debris flows during the latest Holocene, every 125–150 years, since 850 yr. Larger flows occurred, with a record elucidated from debris-flow deposits along Clear Creek, with Middle Holocene ages, ca. 2600 to 5500 yr, most of which have sufficient concentrations of charcoal to indicate origins as postfire debris flows. Deposits at higher elevations show events from the latest Pleistocene ca. 13,000 yr. This geochronology indicates that these are not singular events but are relatively common and inherent to the geomorphic processes shaping this landscape.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The East Asian monsoon is a key component of the global climate system; our understanding of its long-term variability and seasonal dynamics remains incomplete. Here we evaluate calcified root cells (CRCs) as a novel paleoenvironmental proxy. We apply this approach to the Fanshan loess–paleosol sequence, northeast China, on the northern margins of East Asian monsoon influence. We present the first continuous down-profile record of CRC concentrations together with carbonates, stable isotopes (δ 1 ⁸O carb , δ 13 C carb ), and organic matter (δ 13 C org ) and compare these with grain-size and stratigraphic indicators. CRC concentrations correlate with glacial–interglacial variability: high concentrations within paleosol reflect enhanced vegetation and moisture availability, and low values within primary loess units reflect colder, drier conditions. The estimations of δ 1 ⁸O values of precipitation during the Marine Isotope Stage 5 (MIS 5) indicate an intensification of the monsoon rainfall as compared with present-day scenarios. The δ 13 C carb values are unusually low, which is attributed to kinetic isotope effects, thereby suggesting that CRC formation occurs under quasi-closed conditions dominated by soil organic matter respiration. Internal isotopic variability and CRC concentrations within the MIS 5 paleosol point to multiple episodes of pedogenesis. Our results demonstrate the potential of CRCs to record both long-term monsoon variability and short-term hydroclimatic seasonality, informing past East Asian monsoon dynamics.",

In healthy older adults (n=103, ≥50 years old), ex vivo cytokine release of interferon (IFN)-α2, IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α from isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) stimulated with rhinovirus A-16 (RV-16) or influenza A virus (H1N1), circulating immune cell subsets, and plasma IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and TNF-α were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks. Ninety-seven participants completed the intervention (Lf-High n =32, Lf-Low n =31, placebo n =34, withdrawals n =6). There was no difference in RV-16 or H1N1-induced IFN-γ release between groups. At 4-weeks, RV-16-induced IL-6 was lower in Lf-High compared to placebo ( P =0.001), and RV-16-induced IFN-α2 was higher in Lf-High compared to Lf-Low ( P =0.04). Lf-High increased total T cells ( P =0.03) and CD4+ T cells ( P =0.03) compared to placebo. Lf-Low reduced neutrophil ( P =0.04), natural killer cell ( P =0.045), activated CD8+ T cell ( P =0.03), and γδ T cell ( P =0.03) frequency compared to placebo. Plasma IL-6 ( P =0.004) and CRP ( P =0.03) were lower following Lf-High compared to Lf-Low, but not placebo. Both high and low dose lactoferrin altered ex vivo immune cell responses after 4 weeks. High dose lactoferrin increased T-cell subsets, promoting adaptive immunity, and reduced systemic inflammation, while low dose lactoferrin reduced proinflammatory and cytotoxic immune cells. High and low dose lactoferrin supplements may have immunoceutical benefits in older adults.",

This methods and construct development study aimed to identify indicators of a sustainable healthy diet that can be used to inform a multidimensional diet quality score. A modified Delphi was used to gain expert consensus regarding development of a sustainable healthy diet score. Three iterative surveys were conducted between November 2022 and May 2023. Surveys asked participants’ opinion regarding measurement of the three dimensions of sustainable healthy diets (Dimension 1: variety of unprocessed and minimally processed foods; Dimension 2: intake of animal products and; Dimension 3: intake of ultra-processed foods (UPF)) and weighting and aggregation of a score that assesses these three dimensions. Thirteen international experts completed all three surveys. Consensus from experts led to the identification of food-based indicators of sustainable healthy diets. Experts agreed that Dimension 1 should be comprised of 12 food groups, with food groups and scoring ranges informed by the Global Diet Quality Score; Dimension 2 comprised of five food groups with scoring ranges informed by the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet; and Dimension 3 as one food group measured as a cut-off value of ≤10% energy from UPF. There was consensus that each dimension should be equally weighted. Outcomes from this work have been used to inform the development and validation of a multidimensional diet quality score to assess the healthfulness and environmental sustainability of diets among healthy adult populations.",

This cross-sectional study utilized data from 5,693 adults aged ≥18 years in the NHANES 2007–2012 cycles. A HLS (range 0–6) was constructed based on six modifiable factors: non-smoking, no heavy alcohol intake, normal BMI (18.5–24.9 kg/m²), high physical activity (upper tertile of MET-min/week), adequate sleep (7–9 h/night), and appropriate energy intake. Serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free and total thyroxine (FT4, TT4), free and total triiodothyronine (FT3, TT3), thyroglobulin (Tg), and thyroid antibodies (TPOAb, TgAb) were measured. Multivariable linear regression adjusted for sociodemographic factors was used to assess associations. In fully adjusted models, each one-point increase in HLS was associated with lower serum FT4 (β = −0.07 ng/dL; 95% CI: −0.10, −0.03; p &lt; 0.001) and TT4 (β = −0.11 µg/dL; 95% CI: −0.15, −0.06; p &lt; 0.001).

Associations for other thyroid markers were not statistically significant after correction for multiple comparisons (p &gt; 0.05). A healthier lifestyle is inversely associated with serum FT4 and TT4 levels, highlighting potential links between modifiable behaviors and thyroid physiology.",

It was a work of sensationalist, exposé journalism, documenting with titillating details the city’s rampant vice, dire social problems such as unemployment and homelessness, and corrupt officials and politicians. The book was, among other things, a contribution to the Social Gospel movement. It even inspired Charles M. Sheldon’s bestselling novel, In His Steps (1896), with its refrain, “What would Jesus do?” The author of If Christ Came to Chicago , W. T. Stead (1849–1912), however, was an Englishman. Stead’s earlier efforts at the New Journalism had been focused upon London, including his “Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon” articles and ghostwriting In Darkest England and the Way Out (1890) for the founder of the Salvation Army, William Booth. When he turned to the Windy City, however, Stead was attacked for being an interloper, a foreigner who should not have presumed to pronounce a harsh judgment upon an American city. One of his responses to this charge was to try to recast himself as an insider through evoking the category of “our common English-speaking race.” This article explores transatlantic crossings, collaborations, and condemnations. Stead himself died in one of the greatest failed transatlantic crossings of the twentieth century, the sinking of the Titanic.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Public rituals of buffalo sacrifice have a prominent place in the political history of eastern India. They were productive activities in agrarian livelihoods, stages for intercommunal politics, unifying spectacles for regional kings, and justifications for colonial military interventions. While their historical scale is much reduced today, in parts of southern Odisha, they remain important political events. Drawing on historical research and long-term ethnographic fieldwork in Odisha’s Kandhamal Hills, this article examines how public rituals of sacrifice form a site of commensuration: a space where interlocal relations of mutuality and difference are temporarily made visible, and where value is defined in the presence of diverse audiences. By focusing on one specific ritual event, I show how these “sacrificial publics” are structured around the tensions of sovereignty (togetherness and transgression) and have long been spaces where different kinds of sovereign power have become legible. Historicizing an enduring sacrificial politics at India’s upland margins, I outline a distinctly anthropological concept of sovereignty—one that reflects the ways human relationships are made commensurable in lasting political formations, sustained through interlocal and intercommunal patterns of recognition.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Lactotransferrin ( LTF ), a critical multifunctional glycoprotein, plays an essential role in the immune defence, growth and development, and milk quality of dairy cows. The regulatory mechanisms governing gene expression are intricate, with sequence variations in the promoter region potentially exerting a substantial impact on gene expression. In this study, sequencing analysis of the bovine lactotransferrin promoter region was conducted, leading to the identification of two linked single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites. A significant association between these SNPs and lactotransferrin content was observed in a cohort of 301 Holstein cows. Subsequently, further investigation into the transcriptional activity of various lactotransferrin genotypes was performed by constructing promoter fragments encompassing different lactotransferrin genotypes. The findings reveal that the two SNPs significantly influence the activity of the lactotransferrin promoter, thereby affecting lactotransferrin expression. These results hold substantial implications for advancing our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms underlying lactotransferrin expression and for the genetic enhancement of dairy cows.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The unanticipated spillover effects of economic policies on residents’ political trust have seldom been discussed in the literature. This paper examines the impact of the rapid increase in housing prices, triggered by the economic stimulus policies implemented by the Chinese government in response to the 2008 financial crisis, on residents’ political trust. Empirical research based on data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) indicates that the rapid rise in housing prices had differentiated effects on political trust among different age groups: it weakened the political trust of the younger and middle-aged groups but enhanced the political trust felt by elderly groups. Mechanism analysis reveals that the sudden and rapid rise in housing prices exacerbated younger people’s housing difficulties, suppressed their wealth accumulation and undermined their sense of self-efficacy, thus eroding their political trust. The findings of this paper not only extend the research on the formation mechanism of political trust but also broaden the research perspective of housing politics and provide new empirical evidence for understanding the complex dynamic relationship between economic development and political stability.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This short essay describes the nature and far-reaching impact of a large-format undergraduate course on U.S. legal history that legal historian Stanley N. Katz taught at Princeton University for almost ten years, starting in 1978. The course had a complex origin story, rooted in curricular innovations of the 1960s. It was unusual in its demand that students pursue sustained immersion in primary sources, debate their meaning, and take interpretive positions. Katz taught the course socratically, eschewing lectures. Because Princeton faculty often precepted for fellow faculty—attending Katz’s large-format sessions and leading their own small weekly discussion sections—Katz’s approach persuaded some colleagues to change their own teaching approaches. At a time when legal history was expanding as a research and teaching field, the course, along with its extensive reading materials that were not available in published form, was transplanted to other campuses by Katz’s students and associates.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Digital technologies provide a convenient and scalable approach to dietary assessment and personalised feedback, facilitating behaviour change. This is essential for reducing the prevalence of non-communicable diseases at a population level. However, the evaluation of the acceptability and feasibility of dietary feedback delivered via online platforms has not been thoroughly investigated. By utilising the term ‘system architecture’ to describe the essential components of the digital approach to capturing dietary feedback, this systematic review outlines the platform, dietary assessment methodology, reference values for assessing dietary intake, and elements of personalised dietary feedback. When reported, the acceptability and feasibility of personalised feedback were captured. OVID Medline, OVID Embase, Scopus via Elsevier, and Cinahl Plus via EBSCO identified 5,839 studies. Search terms included dietary assessment, feedback, and digital technologies. In total, 28 studies involving 301,271 participants were included. Food frequency questionnaires were the most commonly used dietary assessment method, accessed via web-based platforms. Dietary intake was commonly assessed using a diet quality index, and feedback was provided on food groups, often combined with a diet quality score or macronutrient analysis. While participant acceptance of personalised dietary feedback was generally high, the overall completion rates for acceptability questionnaires were low, and feasibility was seldom reported. Methods used to measure acceptability and feasibility varied, preventing comparisons across studies. Study quality was high; however, future research would benefit from the involvement of stakeholders and end-users in designing feedback messages.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background: This study aimed to evaluate patients with beta thalassaemia major using the cardiac electrophysiological index of balance, a new electrocardiography parameter, and to predict ventricular arrhythmias. Methods: In this study, 60 beta thalassaemia major and 60 healthy children were included. All patients were evaluated with echocardiography. P-wave dispersion, repolarisation times, repolarisation dispersion times, and cardiac electrophysiological balance index were measured using 12-lead electrocardiography. Heart rate variability parameters were evaluated with a 24-hour Holter electrocardiography. Results: Left ventricular functions were similar between the groups. Although repolarisation times (QT, JT, and JTp) were significantly lower in the beta thalassaemia major group, heart rate-corrected repolarisation times were similar. Except for Tpe/QT, which is one of the repolarisation dispersion parameters, the other parameters were similar. The heart rate-corrected cardiac electrophysiological index of balance ratio was significantly higher in the beta thalassaemia major group. QRS duration and QRS-dispersion duration (QRS-d) were similar between the groups. There was a correlation between blood ferritin levels and LVmass-i, Tpe/QT, Tpe/QTc, QTc/QRS ratio, and QT, JT, and JTp values. Discussion: Patients with beta thalassaemia major are at high risk for ventricular arrhythmia due to a high QTc/QRS ratio, despite normal left ventricular systolic, diastolic, and autonomic function in the early period. We believe that there is a moderate correlation between blood ferritin levels and the QTc/QRS ratio and that the QTc/QRS ratio can provide important information for the follow-up and evaluation of patients with beta thalassaemia major. Conclusions: Despite normal early ventricular function in the beta thalassaemia major group, they were at high risk of ventricular arrhythmias.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background: Exercise capacity (VO 2peak ) predicts mortality in adult patients with CHD. There is a lack of paediatric exercise capacity data based on specific CHD lesions, limiting the ability to contextualise interpretation based on expected performance during testing. The primary aim of this study was to establish VO 2peak percentiles for paediatric patients with repaired CHD undergoing treadmill-based cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Methods: Retrospective analysis of CPET data from 2004 to 2022. CPETs were analysed for patients with CHD aged 6–18 years. Patients with repaired CHD were categorised based on their most haemodynamically significant CHD lesion. Percentiles and age-based trends were plotted for each group. Results: A total of 887 patients were included. CHD patients were divided into ten diagnostic subgroups. The mean percent expected VO 2peak for each of the subgroups were as follows: Atrial and ventricular septal defect (94.5 ± 25.1%), pulmonary valve repair (88.1 ± 18.4%), aortic valve repair (92.7 ± 16.4%), tricuspid and mitral valve repair (81.3 ± 20.4%), coarctation of the aorta (93.6 ± 18.8%), transposition of the great arteries (90.5 ± 19.4%), double outlet right ventricle and truncus arteriosus (80.5 ± 16.2%), tetralogy of Fallot (85.6 ± 20.9%), left ventricle dominant Fontan (74.7 ± 18.3%), and right ventricle dominant Fontan (75.7 ± 16.7%). Conclusion: There is a varying degree of reduced exercise capacity in paediatric patients with repaired CHD. Univentricular hearts and tricuspid and mitral valve repair have the lowest VO 2peak . These CHD-specific percentiles may help providers risk-stratify and counsel patients with CHD.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective: The childhood composite index of anthropometric failure (CIAF) effectively identifies multiple anthropometric deficits among under-five children. This study aimed to analyze undernutrition among under-five children, as measured by childhood CIAF, to evaluate trends, determinants, and disparities in Bangladesh between 2007-2022. Design: The study utilized data from five rounds of the nationally representative cross-sectional Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) conducted in 2007, 2011, 2014, 2017–18, and 2022. The CIAF was estimated using six mutually exclusive anthropometric failure categories in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) child growth standards. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to explore determinants of CIAF. The concentration index and concentration curve were used to assess the changes in inequity. Setting: Bangladesh. Participants: 32,096 under-five children. Results: The prevalence of childhood CIAF declined significantly from 56% (95% CI: 55–58) in 2007 to 35% (95% CI: 33–36) in 2022. The significant reduction in “stunting and underweight” from 23% (95% CI: 22–24) in 2007 to 11% (95% CI: 10–12) in 2022 was a major contributor to the decrease in childhood CIAF. Child age, household socioeconomic status (SES), and mother’s education were significant determinants of childhood CIAF across all study periods. Negative concentration index for SES, residence, mother’s and father’s education indicate pro-poor inequality in childhood CIAF, which declined from 2007 to 2022. Conclusions: Despite significant progress, disparities in childhood CIAF across SES, residence, and parental education persist in Bangladesh. Targeted policy interventions are crucial to mitigating childhood undernutrition and achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2.2.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Late-phase graft incompatibility and subsequent yield reduction pose significant threats to sustainable nutmeg ( Myristica fragrans ) production in India, primarily due to the widespread use of wild Myristica species as rootstocks. Accurate rootstock authentication at the seedling stage is critical to prevent these long-term losses, but current methodologies are insufficient. This study develops novel chloroplast DNA (cpDNA)-based markers for species authentication and phylogenetic analysis in Myristica . Utilizing a comparative chloroplast genomics approach, we identified hypervariable regions to create robust sequence length polymorphism markers. Marker validation across 33 diverse Myristica accessions, including all major Indian cultivated germplasm, revealed a unique 25 bp deletion in the ycf4-cemA region. This deletion serves as a highly reliable diagnostic marker to differentiate cultivated nutmeg from wild rootstock species. The validated markers were successfully used to authenticate rootstocks in both commercial nurseries and established plantations, offering a critical tool to prevent long-term graft incompatibility. Intraspecific variation within M. fragrans cultivars was observed in the rpoB_trnC-GCA, trnS-UGA _ psbZ and trnR-ACG_rrn5S intergenic spacer regions. UPGMA clustering distinctly separated the Myristica accessions into three discrete phylogenetic groups. Beyond rootstock management, the identified M. fragrans -specific marker can reliably authenticate nutmeg in commercial products, distinguishing it from potential adulterants like M. magnifica and M. andamanica . Furthermore, we report a species-specific marker for the endemic and IUCN red-listed vulnerable species, M. andamanica , which will be invaluable for its precise identification and conservation efforts. Our research provides an invaluable, easy-to-use toolkit for Myristica germplasm management, breeding programs and quality control of nutmeg products.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study examines how the blind Russian poet Vasily Eroshenko (1890–1952) was visually constructed in 1920s China through Chu Baoheng’s photography, transforming him from political exile to transcultural icon during the May Fourth Movement (1919–1924). Through formal visual analysis of six key photographs taken between 1921 and 1923, this research reveals how these images functioned simultaneously as documentary evidence, cultural allegory, and philosophical “metapictures” – images that reflect on the process of pictorial representation itself. The investigation proceeds through four analytical dimensions: the strategic framing of Eroshenko through translations and media following his 1921 expulsion from Japan; his photographic documentation at Stopani’s memorial in Shanghai as revolutionary allegory; his intimate portrayal in Zhou Zuoren’s traditional courtyard house and Beijing’s social spaces, revealing visual evidence of cultural integration and domestic harmony; and the iconic “poet on a donkey” image that crystallized the dialectical tension between these photographs of social belonging and the Zhou brothers’ textual accounts of “desert-like” loneliness. This contradiction illuminates May Fourth intellectuals’ complex negotiation between cosmopolitanism and nationalism. Eroshenko’s evolving portrayal from revolutionary exile to literati scholar reveals how transnational figures become screens for local intellectual projections about modernity. By examining how these photographs gained new significance across changing political contexts – particularly in Zhou Zuoren’s post-1949 reinterpretations – this study contributes to our understanding of visual media’s role in constructing cultural memory and articulating intellectual identity during China’s pivotal engagement with global modernity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract As the first foreign policy issue Nigeria debated, the controversy around France’s nuclear tests, conducted in Algeria during the War of Independence there, allowed Lagos to rehearse its envisioned African role even before formal independence in October 1960. Nigerian opposition to France eventually culminated in the expulsion of the French ambassador on 5 January 1961, after the third French atomic test in the Algerian Sahara. This seemingly straightforward anti-colonial and anti-nuclear act was in fact largely driven by inter-African dynamics, particularly Nigeria’s complicated relationship with Ghana. By reconstructing this episode, the article demonstrates how international affairs uniquely crystallized interactions between domestic and regional politics in decolonizing states. This in turn encourages us to look beyond the paradigms of the Cold War and decolonization when writing the Global South into world history.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study presents an innovative method for in situ measurements of electrical conductivity at microwave frequencies using a dielectric resonator (DR)-based probe. The DR, excited in the transverse electric mode with azimuthal index 0, radial index 1, and an open (non-integer) axial field variation denoted by δ (TE 01δ mode) by a ridged waveguide, interacts with metallic layers as small as 5 × 5 mm 2 on a dielectric substrate, enabling precise conductivity measurements through reflection coefficient analysis and electromagnetic simulations. Validation is performed by comparing the probe’s conductivity extraction results at 13.28 GHz with a conventional resonant cavity method at 10 GHz, demonstrating strong agreement. The used samples are therefore much smaller than what other comparable methods would require. The method is further applied to additively manufactured metallic deposits produced via a micro-dispensing technique, providing insights into their high-frequency (HF) conductivity and the effects of surface roughness. Additionally, a second-generation contact-based probe is developed to extend the characterization capabilities to larger samples and perform HF surface conductivity mapping. This advancement enables localized evaluations of surface properties and correlations with roughness, offering a valuable tool for optimizing additively manufactured components for HF applications.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper presents an actively controllable nonreciprocal metasurface based on a ferrite–patch structure with PIN diodes for dynamic control. Two activation methods are investigated: (a) phase control, which enables a 30° transmission-phase shift while maintaining nonreciprocal behavior, and (b) ON–OFF control, which switches the response by altering the propagation path. The phase-control metasurface is analyzed using transmission-line theory, full-wave simulation, and experiments, showing good agreement across methods. The ON–OFF design is optimized to suppress bidirectional transmission when ON. Experimental results confirm strong nonreciprocity, though slight frequency shifts arise from FR4 variability, and a back-fitted simulation improves consistency. The proposed dual-control framework provides a compact and low-cost approach to reconfigurable nonreciprocal surfaces that retain the use of permanent magnets for ferrite bias and are applicable to microwave wireless systems, including adaptive isolation, interference control, and tunable shielding. The results demonstrate the feasibility of compact, reconfigurable nonreciprocal metasurfaces using simple biasing circuits and offer design insights for frequency-stable implementations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Object detection models, such as those in the YOLO family, are generally effective identifying individual weeds, but their performance can be limited by occlusion of target structures in high density scenes. These models are typically trained on images with low weed densities, where individual plants are clearly visible and easy to annotate, yet they are used in field conditions where areas of high density and dense vegetation may occur. Greenhouse experiments were conducted at the University of Florida, Wimauma, FL, to evaluate how purple nutsedge ( Cyperus rotundus L.) density impacts the performance of a YOLOv8 model. A greenhouse density test dataset was developed by collecting 480 images of twelve densities ranging from 7 to 331 plants m -2 , at transplant and at 3, 6, 10, and 17 days after transplanting. An independent dataset of 2,221 field and greenhouse images was used for the training of a YOLOv8 extra-large model to detect C. rotundus . A logistic sigmoidal model was fitted to evaluate the F1 score as a function of increasing C. rotundus density at each data collection time point. The F1 score showed sigmoidal relationships with density at all time points, exceeding 0.9 at low densities but dropping sharply to near 0 at the highest density and later time points. Performance decline was primarily driven by increased false negatives as density and occlusion increased, with minimal contribution from false positives except at the highest densities. Density thresholds for optimal performance (F1 ≥ 0.90) decreased from 157 to 86 plants m -2 as canopy coverage increased, while marginal performance (F1 = 0.50) dropped from 322 to 140 plants m -2 . Our findings suggest that object detection models for C. rotundus are strongly influenced by increased occlusion and morphological changes resulting from greater plant proximity and canopy coverage in high density scenes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This systematic review evaluated studies published between 1980 and 2025 on the chemical control of smut grass [ Sporobolus indicus (L.) R. Br.] in the Americas, with a focus on pastures. After screening 446 publications, 13 peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in the subtropical United States, particularly in Florida, on bahiagrass ( Paspalum notatum Fluggé) pastures, with only one study carried out in Brazil. The most frequently reported herbicide was hexazinone, present in over 80% of the studies, applied either alone or in combination with mechanical methods or fertilization. Consistent results indicated control efficacy above 85%, especially at doses ≥ 0.84 kg ha⁻¹ and when applied during summer. Selectivity for use in P. notatum was considered satisfactory, despite temporary phytotoxic symptoms. Integrated strategies, such as herbicide applications combined with nitrogen fertilization, showed potential to restore forage dominance and reduce reinfestation. Other herbicides, such as glyphosate, indaziflam, imazapic, mesotrione, and triazines, were less frequently investigated. Indaziflam, applied pre-emergence, caused a significant reduction in the seedbank, showing promise for preventive management, given the high dormancy and longevity of S. indicus seeds. The integration of chemical and mechanical control produced variable outcomes: in some cases, mowing prior to application reduced efficacy, whereas in others, when associated with strategies to remove growing points and subsequent herbicide application, it enhanced control. The scarcity of studies under Brazilian and other tropical or subtropical conditions limits the understanding of species adaptation and the efficiency of management methods across different edaphoclimatic contexts. Expanding research in these regions is crucial for developing effective and sustainable management strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Every year agriculture uses 2 million metric tons of plastic mulch in the form of polyethylene (i.e., “PE mulch”) to grow the world’s food. Plastic mulch is a key tool for growers to suppress weeds, improve crop microclimates, increase yields, mitigate erosion, and potentially enhance crop quality. However, plastic mulch use comes at a major environmental cost due to poor end-of-life outcomes. Hydromulch (also known as “hydramulch” or “hydro-mulch”) is an alternative, sprayable, soil-biodegradable mulch technology made from biobased feedstocks that can be formulated to be acceptable in certified organic agriculture in the United States and Canada. Paper-based hydromulches are generally made from some combination of recycled cellulose fiber, water, tackifier or other binding agents, and sometimes filler derived from various agricultural residues or waste products. The objective of this review is to provide a historical overview of hydromulch, highlight key findings from previous hydromulch research, and provide recommendations to advance the use of hydromulch as a biobased, soil-biodegradable alternative to plastic mulches in specialty crop agriculture. Feedstock and application costs are still major barriers for commercialization and may be mitigated by further research, including the creation of hydromulch formulations that utilize agricultural residues without compromising the physical properties of the mulch layer. Overall, this literature review indicates that hydromulch is a promising technology, but also one in need of further research to be viable across a broad spectrum of cropping systems and environments.",

    "Abstract": "Real-time monitoring of intracellular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) is crucial for understanding cell proliferation, differentiation, and metabolic processes, as well as for observing cellular behavior within hypoxic tissues associated with conditions such as cancer, ischemia, and chronic kidney disease. We developed small-molecule intracellular O<sub>2</sub> probes based on the cationic Ir(III) complexes C6-BA and C545T-BA (C6 = coumarin 6, C545T = coumarin 545T, and BA = <i>N,N'</i>-dibutylethylenediamine) and investigated intracellular O<sub>2</sub> levels using a commercially available microplate reader and phosphorescence lifetime imaging microscope (PLIM). The synthesized Ir(III) complexes exhibited a strong visible absorption band with a molar absorption coefficient of approximately 100,000 dm<sup>-3</sup> mol<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> due to singlet ligand-centered π,π* transitions originating from the C6 and C545T ligands. C6-BA and C545T-BA exhibited bright emission with high quantum yield (0.65 for C6-BA, 0.44 for C545T-BA) and remarkably long emission lifetimes (34.8 μs for C6-BA, 53.7 μs for C545T-BA) in N<sub>2</sub>-saturated acetonitrile. A comprehensive study of cellular analyses of these complexes revealed that C6-BA and C545T-BA are efficiently taken up by cultured cells and exhibit high O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity. The phosphorescence lifetime of living cells stained with each Ir(III) complex determined by measuring time-resolved emission using a microplate reader enabled tracking of real-time changes in cellular O<sub>2</sub> tension after treatment with metabolic stimulants. Furthermore, we acquired PLIM images of living cells stained with C6-BA followed by treatment with metabolic stimulants. Time-lapse PLIM analysis showed a heterogeneous O<sub>2</sub> distribution within the field of view and variations in O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure between individual cells.",

    "Abstract": "The oxidation of Am<sup>3+</sup> and stabilization of its higher oxidation states are critical for Am/<i>Cm</i> separations and for understanding its fundamental chemistry. While most researchers focused on Am oxidation in HNO<sub>3</sub>. Other reports indicate stabilization of AmO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> and AmO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> in H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and HCl media, respectively, using NaBiO<sub>3</sub>. However, the formation and stabilization of Am higher oxidation states in these ternary heterogeneous systems (NaBiO<sub>3(s)</sub> + mineral acid<sub>(aq)</sub> + Am<sub>(aq)</sub>) remain unclear. In the present work, we investigated the behavior of NaBiO<sub>3</sub> in different acidic solutions (binary system) and extended it to a ternary system (NaBiO<sub>3</sub> + Am<sup>3+</sup> in HCl). Although different mineral acids react uniquely with NaBiO<sub>3</sub>, an increase in the initial pH after NaBiO<sub>3</sub> contact was observed in all cases, but to a different extent. The variations in the equilibrium pH and mineralogy of acid-treated NaBiO<sub>3</sub> suggest that H<sup>+</sup> ions plays key role in Bi<sup>5+</sup> → Bi<sup>3+</sup> conversion. Additionaly the specific anion of the mineral acid appears to dictate the formation of additional mineral phases. Our findings suggest that the higher stability of AmO<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> in HCl is primarily due to its elevated pH following NaBiO<sub>3</sub> contact, which prevents its reduction/disproportionation. Conversely, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4,</sub> being a polyprotic acid, behaves differently and stabilizes AmO<sub>2</sub><sup>2+</sup> mainly through phosphate complexation.",

    "Abstract": "Microglia are pivotal regulators of neuroimmune homeostasis in the central nervous system, and their dysregulation is linked to neurodegeneration and brain aging. Among the principal sesame-seed lignans, sesamin has demonstrated robust neuroprotective effects via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways, whereas the neural actions and underlying mechanisms of sesaminol remain undefined. Here, we compared sesaminol with sesamin regarding cognition, neuroinflammation, and microglial polarization in middle-aged mice, and assessed the effects of sesaminol in LPS-challenged mice. In middle-aged mice, sesaminol restored spatial and recognition memory and amplified hippocampal neurotrophic signaling, while sesamin showed only modest benefits. Sesaminol also reversed LPS-induced cognitive deficits in mice. Moreover, sesaminol suppressed oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and shifted the microglia toward an M2-dominant phenotype, probably in a HIF-1α-dependent manner. Furthermore, sesaminol accelerated Aβ40/42 clearance by upregulating lysosomal functions. Thus, sesaminol restores microglial homeostasis and Aβ clearance to counter chronic and acute cognitive decline and might be one potential antiaging agent.",

    "Abstract": "Global optimization of bimetallic and monometallic cluster structures remains computationally challenging, particularly due to the rapid increase in homotops with system size and compositional complexity. To address this issue, we present a Collaborative Differential Evolution (CDE) algorithm featuring a multisubpopulation collaborative architecture specifically designed for efficient structure prediction of diverse nanocluster systems. The framework integrates three functionally specialized subpopulations for exploration, exploitation, and balance along with adaptive operations tailored for metallic nanoclusters. This algorithm is implemented as a user-friendly online C++ toolkit. We demonstrate the versatility and robustness of our approach through comprehensive structural optimization across three distinct case studies: Pt-Pd and Cu-Au bimetallic clusters, as well as monometallic Pt clusters. The CDE algorithm consistently achieves 50-100% faster convergence and superior stability compared to conventional methods across all tested systems, establishing itself as a robust and generalizable tool for accelerating the discovery of stable configurations in diverse cluster materials.",

We also predict distinct <sup>35</sup>Cl NQR signatures for chlorine vacancies and additional vicinal/geminal chlorines, resulting in an increased ν. Using this methodology, two types of PVC samples are analyzed: commercial high-MW and low-MW PVC. Both show numerous Cl environments associated with both terminal and internal Cl, as well as additional features indicating the presence of Cl defects. Analysis of a partially dechlorinated PVC reveals that dechlorination primarily occurs at the terminal positions, while multichlorinated sites are less reactive and remain mostly untouched. This combined computational-experimental approach demonstrates that <sup>35</sup>Cl NQR can sensitively distinguish chlorine sites in PVC, enabling the direct detection of defects relevant to stability, degradation, and recycling strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Quantitative live cell monitoring of catalytic activity is essential for advancing chemical biology, yet designing substrate probes that combine broad applicability with finely tunable kinetics remains a significant challenge. While glyco-bisacetal-based substrates (BABS) have proven applicable to several enzymes, their alkyl-hemiacetal core can limit turnover rates for certain enzymes. Herein, we report a novel one-pot, three-component glycosylation strategy to synthesize Aryl-BABS through the trapping of transient aryl-hemiacetals. This approach enables rapid diversification of the bisacetal scaffold using various phenols, yielding a library of aryl-bisacetal substrates. Kinetic evaluation of catalytic hydrolysis with a model glycosidase demonstrated that these Aryl-BABS are efficiently processed, with turnover rates up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than analogous alkyl glycosides and approaching those seen for activated <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl glycosides. Simple substitutions to phenol lead to a 20-fold range of kinetic tunability. Crucially, stopped-flow studies combined with kinetic simulations revealed that the breakdown of the enzymatically released aryl-hemiacetal is extremely rapid, at least 100-fold faster than that of alkyl-hemiacetals. This synthetic and kinetic tunability offers a powerful roadmap for developing advanced substrate probes of biocatalysts, eventually enabling quantitative measurement of previously intractable enzymes in living systems.",

    "Abstract": "Dopants in semiconductor nanostructures offer tremendous control over electronic, optical, and magnetic properties beyond what is achievable in bulk materials. We demonstrate that the broad dopant emission in semiconductor nanoplatelets effectively maps the electron wave function across the nanoplatelet thickness. Both the emission energy and lifetime of the dopant transition depend strongly on the depth of the dopant within the nanoplatelet. This dependence arises from the electrostatic self-interaction of the charged dopant, which varies with proximity to the dielectric discontinuity at the nanoplatelet surface. Through comprehensive single-particle spectroscopy of silver-doped CdSe nanoplatelets, we verify that acceptors near the center emit at higher energies with shorter lifetimes, while those near the surface emit at lower energies with longer lifetimes. This spatial mapping also reveals unusual two-color emission from individual nanoplatelets, with enhanced Auger recombination yielding exceptional photon antibunching (>90% purity) at room temperature, suggesting potential applications in quantum information technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: This study aimed to establish normative reference data from a sample of 456 Algerian nonpatient adults for the Rorschach Comprehensive System (CS), addressing the lack of culture-specific norms for Algeria. Participants were randomly recruited from 34 wilayas to ensure geographic, educational, and socioeconomic representativeness. Examiners underwent rigorous training (70 hr) in CS administration and coding, and interrater reliability was assessed through double coding of 19% of the protocols, yielding excellent agreement (Cohen’s κ = .84–.99). Descriptive statistics were generated and compared with US norms ( Exner, 2007 ), Composite International Reference Values (CIRVs; Meyer et al., 2007 ), and French reference data (Sultan et al., 2004). Findings revealed several distinct patterns in the Algerian sample, including lower developmental quality scores (DQ+), XA%, and WDA%; higher proportions of pure form (F) responses; and fewer popular responses compared to international reference samples. Over half of the participants obtained a positive Coping Deficit Index (CDI), whereas other indicators of psychological disturbance (DEPI, PTI) remained within normal limits. These results suggest that Algerian respondents tend to rely on a more concrete, form-focused perceptual style, with fewer conventional responses, potentially reflecting cultural attitudes toward psychological assessment. This study provides the first comprehensive Algerian CS norms, offering an essential reference for clinical practice and research both within Algeria and among Algerian-origin populations abroad.",

Using new seismic data from the 2nd‐phase array of the China‐Myanmar Geophysical Survey in the Myanmar Orogen, we construct a high‐resolution catalog of 1,819 local‐shallow earthquakes in central and southern Myanmar by combining deep‐learning algorithms and manual phase‐pick refinement, with 93 robust focal mechanisms. Integrated with a previous catalog further north, our analysis reveals that the Sagaing Fault dips eastward at ∼73° in the north, transitions to a nearly‐vertical geometry at ∼20.5°N, and continues further south. This newly identified fault segmentation and associated geometric variations provide essential constraints for improving fine‐scale rupture modelling of the 2025 earthquake. For the whole of Myanmar, our results suggest an abrupt along‐strike north‐south change of shallow seismicity across ∼20°N, with contrasting earthquake distributions and focal mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is a persistent pollutant with potential long‐term effects on the environment and on health. Recent studies using ice core records report large increases (up to tenfold) in Arctic TFA deposition since the 1970s, and trends suggest long‐lived chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacements may be a major source. Here, we use a chemical transport model to examine the global TFA budget arising from CFC replacements–hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)–and inhalation anesthetics. Global TFA deposition from these sources increased ∼3.5‐fold from 6.8 (5.9–7.6) Gg/yr in 2000 to 21.8 (18.6–25.0) Gg/yr in 2022, with cumulative deposition reaching 335.5 Gg. We find HCFC‐123, HCFC‐124, and HFC‐134a account for most modeled TFA production and that long‐lived CFC replacements account for virtually all of the observed Arctic deposition trend. At lower latitudes, our analysis supports the recent emergence of hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) as a TFA source. We conclude that increased TFA monitoring is required.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Infrasound from controlled explosions provides a unique opportunity to isolate atmospheric effects on propagation. We report observations from two campaigns in May and October 2024, each featuring 10‐ton TNT‐equivalent controlled surface chemical explosions recorded by a dense network of 31 single‐sensor stations within 23 km. Despite identical sources, the observed wavefields were very different. October signals followed a near‐unimodal period–distance trend, whereas May signals exhibited a pronounced azimuthal bifurcation in both period and celerity. Downwind paths largely preserved the short‐period baseline observed in October, while upwind paths showed systematically longer periods caused by wind‐driven low‐pass filtering. This study provides the first direct observational evidence that tropospheric winds can impose azimuth‐dependent low‐pass filtering at local ranges, without the influence of measured temperature inversions. Thus, the structure of the atmosphere can modify the spectral characteristics of low‐frequency acoustic waves even at a distance of only a few kilometers.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Modeling coupled groundwater flow and reactive transport for multi‐query tasks is computationally prohibitive, and standard Physics‐Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) require costly retraining for each new parameter. We introduce the Multi‐Physics Generative Pre‐trained PINN (MP‐GPT‐PINN), a meta‐learning framework to resolve this bottleneck. Its innovation is a two‐stage strategy: an offline pre‐training stage uses a greedy algorithm to build a compact library of PINN solutions for key parameters. A rapid online stage then generates new solutions by combining these pre‐trained bases in an optimal linear manner. For multi‐physics problems, we designed a parallel dual‐network architecture to couple the seepage and chemical fields robustly. Validated across complex groundwater systems, MP‐GPT‐PINN accelerates online predictions by four orders of magnitude while maintaining high fidelity, with dimensionless relative errors for physical fields approaching 10 −3 . This efficiency breakthrough makes computationally intensive tasks, such as large‐scale parameter inversion and uncertainty quantification, feasible in geosciences.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction The global rise in maternal obesity presents a growing public health challenge, with significant implications for pregnancy outcomes. This study offers a comprehensive retrospective analysis of changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) among pregnant women during labor over four decades. Material and methods BMI data were retrospectively collected from 13,193 pregnant women divided into three cohorts: Group 0 (1986–1990), Group 1 (2009–2013), and Group 2 (2024). Results Mean BMI increased significantly from 23.75 kg/m² in Group 0 to 27.33 kg/m² in Group 2 ( p &lt; 0.001). The prevalence of obesity rose more than fivefold, from 4.87% to 25.76%. Regression analysis confirmed a linear and statistically significant upward trajectory across all groups. Conclusions The sustained increase in maternal BMI underscores the urgency of implementing targeted interventions, including preconception counseling and personalized antenatal care, to mitigate the adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes associated with elevated BMI.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis (TMJ-OA) affects a significant proportion of the population worldwide. However, there has been no substantial progress in the development of FDA-approved drugs for treatment due to a lack of understanding of the specific factors regulating key TMJ-OA molecular mechanisms. Lysyl Oxidase-Like-2 (LOXL2) promotes knee joint cartilage protection and is downregulated in a TMJ-OA animal model. We evaluated the role of LOXL2 in TMJ cartilage, its molecular mechanism, and gene networks using in vivo Loxl2 knockout mice ( Acan-Cre; Loxl2 flox/flox ) and ex vivo goat TMJ cartilage. Our results show that Loxl2 knockout in mouse cartilage upregulates Il1b , Mmp9 , Mmp13 , Adamts4 , and Adamts5 , but reduces the levels of aggrecan and proteoglycan. Loxl2 deleted TMJ cartilage show a higher enrichment of inflammatory response, TNFA signaling via NF-κB, extracellular matrix (ECM), and collagen degradation pathway network. Conversely, LOXL2 treatment reduces interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)-induced expression of Mmp13 , protects mitochondrial function, and ECM from degeneration. Importantly, LOXL2 attenuates IL-1β-induced chondrocyte apoptosis via the phosphorylation of NF-κB and expression of the pain-related gene PTGS2 (encodes COX2). Taken together, Loxl2 knockout mice exacerbate TMJ-OA through cartilage/ECM degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction, chondrocyte apoptosis, and inflammatory gene expression, whereas LOXL2 treatment mitigate these effects.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Current crystalline thin-film production techniques typically require specific growth substrates, posing significant challenges for their use in flexible electronics and integrated optoelectronics. In response to these challenges, we introduce a novel method called ‘induced fit growth’, inspired by the induced fit theory in molecular biology. This method overcomes the limitations of current techniques by enabling the deposition of Ga-based semiconductor films, including GaSb, GaSe, GaAs, and GaAsSb, with controllable thickness and morphology on arbitrary substrates. Utilizing a low-cost, wafer-scale vapor deposition process compatible with standard semiconductor procedures, these Ga-based films can be patterned for various functional applications. For example, the patterned Ga-based thin films exhibit broad applicability in p-channel transistor arrays (with hole mobility of 0.25 cm 2 V⁻ 1 s⁻ 1 ), functional synaptic devices, and flexible omnidirectional imaging sensors (maintaining functionality at incident angles as low as 5°). Overall, the proposed induced fit growth method facilitates the growth of Ga-based semiconductor films with greater integration flexibility, enhancing their advanced functionality and broad applicability.",

    "Abstract": "This study presents a high-precision wireless displacement monitoring microsystem that utilizes the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) effect for structural health monitoring (SHM). The system overcomes limitations of traditional SHM methods, providing high-precision, intelligent and lightweight measurements. We established an analytical model of magnetic field displacement and optimized its linear range. Considering the measurement error caused by magnetic field decay, we designed an adaptive sensitivity correction method, thus avoiding the tedious magnetic field numerical fitting process. The system's accuracy and stability are validated through comparison with laser ranging, showing high accuracy within the range of ±7.5 mm, a resolution of 0.4 μm, and a long-term working accuracy better than 2.25 μm. The core system is less than 3.84 cm<sup>3</sup> in size and is inexpensive to manufacture, making it ideal for mass deployment across a broad range of infrastructure. This work outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in the field in terms of accuracy, cost, size, and power consumption. Practical applications in monitoring concrete deformation, crack width changes, and bridge beam end slip deformation highlight its versatility and effectiveness. Its stable performance in long-term autonomous operation has also been verified in a 39-day actual bridge test, making it a valuable tool for enhancing infrastructure maintenance and safety.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Cancer metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality, yet effective treatments remain limited. There is an urgent need to develop novel therapeutic strategies to combat metastasis. In this study, we demonstrate that the bacterial intracellular signaling molecule cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP, or cdG) exerts a potent inhibitory effect on cancer metastasis, particularly in metastatic breast cancer, via both in vitro and in vivo models, with little toxicity to mice. Interestingly, this antimetastatic function is achieved by suppressing the NF-κB signaling pathway, which is important for cancer progression and metastasis, but independent of STING, a previously identified c-di-GMP sensor and NF-κB regulator in mammalian cells. Surprisingly, c-di-GMP inhibits NF-κB activity (p-p65) by directly binding to the proteasome 26S subunit non-ATPase 3 (PSMD3) that we identified as a new TBK1-binding activator, and disrupting the interaction between PSMD3 and TBK1. This PSMD3-TBK1 interaction boosts the phosphorylation and activation of TBK1, representing a noncanonical function of PSMD3 distinct from its established role in proteasomal degradation. Significantly, PSMD3 is highly expressed in malignant and metastatic breast cancers, particularly triple-negative breast cancer. The compelling evidence strongly suggests PSMD3 as a promising target for developing a therapy against metastatic breast cancer. These findings underscore the high potential of c-di-GMP as a safe and effective therapeutic agent for metastatic cancers by targeting the PSMD3-TBK1-NF-κB pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract While progress has been made in transcriptomic profiling of the human brain, functional characterization of brain regions and their interactions on the basis of regional protein expression remains limited. Here, we constructed a proteomic map from thirteen anatomical brain regions of eight cadaver donors to elucidate region-specific protein expression patterns and their implications for brain function. The results underscore the interconnectivity of the four cerebral lobes, suggesting facilitated information integration through large-scale neural networks. We propose a three-module framework (cortical integration module [frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe, occipital lobe], limbic-relay network [amygdaloid nucleus, hippocampus, thalamus/hypothalamus], and midline regulatory axis [thalamus/hypothalamus, corpus callosum, ventricles, optic chiasm]) and provide molecular evidence supporting the potential involvement of the midline regulatory axis, brainstem, and cerebellum in higher-order cognitive functions. The midline regulatory axis may play a critical but underexplored role in neurodevelopment, interregional signaling, and structural homeostasis, potentially through efficient synaptic function, energy metabolism, and extracellular matrix integrity. This analysis may enhance the understanding of brain physiology and highlight the need to integrate proteomic and transcriptomic approaches in the study of brain function and neurological disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective This study aims to evaluate the marginal bone level changes (MBLC), survival, and success rate of 4 mini-implants (MIs) of two different diameters versus two standard-sized implants (SIs) that were loaded functionally and immediately by a complete mandibular denture. Materials and Methods The study comprised 29 participants with conventional complete dentures; they were randomly allocated into three groups. Group S included 11 participants who received two SIs of 3.75 mm diameter, group M3 included 8 participants who received four MIs of 3 mm diameter, and group M2.5 included 10 participants who received four MIs of 2.5 mm diameter. MBLC was evaluated on each implant’s mesial and distal sides after 18 months of loading. A paired t-test and one-way ANOVA were used for intragroup and intergroup comparisons, respectively ( P ≤ 0.05). The evaluation of survival and success rates adhered to the criteria established by the International Congress of Oral Implantologists in Pisa (2007). Results Immediate loading was employed in all cases. No failure occurred in any case. The success rate after 18 months was 90.91% in the S group, 90.63% in the M3 group, and 90% in the M2.5 group. MBLC after 18 months of loading were 0.76 ± 0.62 mm mesially and 0.63 ± 0.90 mm distally in the S group, 1.04 ± 0.72 mm mesially and 1.05 ± 0.84 mm distally in the M3 group, and 1.37 ± 0.73 mm mesially and 1.11 ± 0.68 mm distally in the M2.5 group. Conclusion The SIs group showed better radiographic results and success rates than the MIs groups. As the diameter of the implant decreases, the mean MBLC increases. However, the results of the MIs groups were within acceptable limits. The survival rate was 100% in the three groups.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Insights into the perspectives, decision-making and experiences of non-US consumers regarding health-related direct-to-consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) are currently lacking. These insights are essential to allow the implementation of consumer-tailored approaches that facilitate responsible use of DTC-GT. To fill this knowledge gap, the present study employed interviews to examine the consumer journeys of twenty Dutch health-related DTC-GT consumers. Overall, participants appeared quite satisfied with their DTC-GT consumer journeys. Participants’ initial contacts with DTC-GT, as well as their pre-test information acquisition, occurred via a diversity of sources. Participants’ pre-test expectations revealed considerable presumed clinical utility of DTC-GT. Feeling unheard within the regular healthcare system supported multiple participants’ decisions to undergo health-related DTC-GT. Participants mentioned a modifying effect of price on their decision-making, and several participants stated not having considered potential negative consequences of DTC-GT prior to DTC-GT usage. Several potentially adverse consequences of undergoing DTC-GT were identified that could affect individual consumers, the regular healthcare system, and society as a whole. Three considerations to potentially stimulate responsible use of DTC-GT aligning with participants’ needs and preferences were derived, namely improving pre-test information provision, implementing adequate post-test support systems for consumers, and development, implementation and enforcement of cross-border regulation and legislation. Based on these findings, we advocate for stakeholder discussions to further explore the feasibility and desirability of translating these considerations into deliverables. Ultimately, these deliverables could aid in empowering (potential) consumers for responsible use of health-related DTC-GT.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The clinical relevance of pharmacogenetics (PGx) is becoming increasingly evident as knowledge in this field expands. As of May 2025, 209 clinical guideline annotations are already listed on the internationally recognized ClinPGx website. Nevertheless, except for a few indications, the implementation of PGx in clinical practice currently remains limited in most countries. At the same time, whole genome sequencing (WGS) is increasingly applied in clinical diagnostics, particularly for rare and oncological diseases. These data could also be used for simultaneous PGx analysis. In a retrospective study, we analysed short-read WGS data from 1,000 individuals, including index patients with suspected rare disorders and their relatives. For a subset of 359 individuals, medical reports were reviewed to document drug prescriptions. Guidelines published by PGx consortia on ClinPGx were used for phenotype assignment and interpretation. Clinically relevant PGx variants were detected in 97% ( n = 970) of the cohort. Among patients with drug prescriptions ( n = 359), 30% ( n = 111) had been prescribed at least one medication for which their PGx profile would recommend therapy adjustment. Additionally, CNVs and rare variants were detected, which in 28% ( n = 8) resulted in modified therapeutic recommendations. While the most (cost)-efficient strategy for broad PGx implementation remains subject of future research, our findings demonstrate that existing WGS data, such as those generated in the context of rare disease patients, could provide substantial benefits for PGx diagnostics with minimal additional effort.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Observational epidemiology suggests a link between the dermatological disorder acne vulgaris and several psychiatric disorders. However, the biological mechanisms that underlie the relationship between acne and mental health are poorly characterised. Here, we employed a genetic approach using large-scale genome-wide association studies of acne and ten psychiatric disorders to both estimate causal effects and uncover potential shared genetic risk factors. Multiple psychiatric disorders displayed evidence of small-to-moderate genetic correlations with acne. However, only genetic liability to schizophrenia displayed some evidence of a causal effect on the risk of acne, though horizontal pleiotropy cannot be fully excluded. Using a Gaussian mixture-model based approach, we then identified a cluster of schizophrenia-associated variants with distinct effects on acne liability, refining the molecular mechanisms that may link schizophrenia and acne. Shared genetic risk architecture between schizophrenia and acne was also investigated using Bayesian approaches. This revealed a subset of genetic loci associated with both acne and schizophrenia via shared or different causal variants, implicating biological processes including glutamatergic signalling. Finally, we found that genetic risk for schizophrenia was also associated with increased acne severity using a population-based cohort. In summary, we revealed genetic support for a biological relationship between acne and schizophrenia that may at least partially drive the elevated rates of acne amongst people living with schizophrenia.",

To overcome this critical challenge, we develop a local alkalinity engineering strategy that employs TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles in catalyst layers. These nanoparticles enrich OH<sup>-</sup> in the electric double layer at both electrodes, creating self-sustaining alkaline microenvironments (pH ~ 14), as confirmed by a scanning electrochemical microscopy technique integrating pH microelectrodes. As a result, the engineered electrolyser achieves a high current density of 3.0 A cm<sup>-2</sup> at 2.08 V, approaching that of the precious-metal-based proton exchange membrane water electrolyser under identical conditions. In addition, the local alkalinity alleviates the degradation of non-noble metal catalysts and membrane, thus enabling the electrolyser to realise long-term stability of ~ 1400 h at 1.0 A cm<sup>-2</sup>. We also demonstrate that this local alkalinity strategy can be readily extended to different types of membranes and scaled up, providing a universal tactic to boost the performance of anion exchange membrane water electrolysers.",

A key finding is the role of sulfur as a structural binder, where its softening, distribution, and adhesion properties enable the formation of mechanically robust electrodes without polymer binders. Systematic experimental characterizations and computational modeling reveal the underlying mechanisms governing electrodes formation and electrochemical performance. The developed binder-free positive electrodes achieve a reversible capacity of 932 mAh g⁻¹ after 500 cycles at 1.0 C rate; for comparison, conventional slurry-cast positive electrodes containing 10 wt.% binder deliver lower capacity under the same electrochemical test conditions.

    "Abstract": "Human disturbances are modifying animal behavior in ecosystems worldwide, with the potential to reshape species interactions. For instance, human-induced shifts in diel activity may disrupt the alignment of daily activity patterns between interacting species and destabilize temporal niche partitioning. To test this hypothesis, we leverage a global meta-analysis on the effects of human disturbance on diel activity and overlap of 480 mammalian predator-prey and intraguild predator dyads from 57 studies. We demonstrate that human disturbance has no overall effect on temporal overlap. Instead, the body mass ratios between dominant species and subordinate species shape the influence of human disturbance. When subordinates are larger than dominant species, humans compress the temporal niche (i.e., higher diel overlap), but when dominant species are larger than subordinate species, humans expand the temporal niche (i.e., lower diel overlap). These results suggest that larger bodied mammals \"lose\" the temporal predator-prey response race under human disturbance, with large predators experiencing less overlap with their prey, and large prey facing more overlap with their predators. As the human footprint expands globally, we can expect continued alterations to the animal temporal niche, with consequences for species interactions, population persistence, community structure, and evolutionary dynamics.",

The Li-Zn alloy strengthens tensile resistance and regulates lithium deposition, while the Li 3 N-enriched carbon nanotube network reinforces mechanical toughness, achieving a rupture toughness of 1.3 × 10⁶ J/m³, a 12-fold enhancement over bare lithium. This property enables the fabrication of thin negative electrodes (&lt;10 μm) that resist pulverization during deep Li plating/stripping. In cells with LiNi 0.8 Co 0.1 Mn 0.1 O 2 positive electrodes, the composite negative electrode facilitates extended cyclability (&gt;500 cycles in coin cells at 1 C, 92% retention after 300 cycles in Ah-grade pouch cells at 0.5 C) and sustain high-rate operation (10 C). An 8.5 Ah pouch cell demonstrates a practical specific energy of 553 Wh kg −1 at cell level when tested at 0.1 C. This work presents a design strategy for realizing high-energy, long-cycle-life lithium metal batteries.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Nuclear protein homeostasis, including transcription factor turnover, critically depends on the nuclear proteasomes that must be imported after cell division. This dynamic process requires AKIRIN2, a small unstructured protein whose mechanistic role has remained elusive despite its essential function. Using an integrated approach combining protein-wide saturation mutagenesis screens, cryo-EM, and biochemical reconstitution, we characterize AKIRIN2 as a scaffold protein that coordinates the assembly of an importin cluster around the proteasome. AKIRIN2 binds in multiple copies to the 20S proteasome and simultaneously interacts with importin IPO9 and the KPNA2/KPNB1 heterodimer. In the nucleus, RanGTP triggers importin dissociation, releasing the proteasome, while AKIRIN2 undergoes ubiquitin-independent degradation. Our findings reveal how AKIRIN2’s multivalency facilitates the recruitment of multiple importins to the proteasome, a critical adaptation for transporting this large macromolecular complex into the nucleus and maintaining the nuclear proteome.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Assessing and understanding the impacts of all possible mutations at a drug binding site remain challenging. Here we use multiplex oligo targeting for mutational profiling, and computational modelling, to decode efficacy and resistance space at the otherwise native binding site for an anti-trypanosomal proteasome inhibitor. We saturation-edit twenty codons in the Trypanosoma brucei proteasome and subject the resulting libraries to stepwise drug selection and codon variant scoring, yielding dose-response profiles for &gt;100 resistance-conferring mutants. Codon variant scores are predictive of relative resistance observed using a bespoke set of mutants, while fitness profiling reveals otherwise extensive constraints on mutational fitness and resistance space. The resistance profile is predictive of routes to spontaneous drug resistance observed within ‘accessible’, single nucleotide mutational space, while in silico predictions are closely aligned with impacts on drug resistance observed in cellulo. Thus, multiplex oligo targeting facilitates assessment of all possible mutations at a drug binding site.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the effect of surface grinding on the pitting corrosion resistance of high-S and low-S Type 304 stainless steels. Microelectrochemical analysis reveals that MnS inclusions serve as the initiation sites for pitting, whereas no pitting occurs in MnS-free regions. Severe grinding with #60 SiC paper significantly reduces the pitting potential, whereas moderate grinding with #320 SiC paper produces only a negligible change. The reduction in pitting corrosion resistance is attributed to grinding-induced alterations in MnS morphology, including deformation and embedding. In contrast, moderate grinding (#320 SiC paper) does not significantly alter MnS morphology and therefore preserves pitting corrosion resistance comparable to that of mirror-polishing surfaces. Grinding introduced unevenness of passive film thickness, and the intersections between MnS inclusions and scratches act as preferential pit initiation sites. However, the decrease in protective capability of the passive films alone does not fully account for the observed decrease in pitting potential following severe grinding.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The pharmacological treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia remains a major unmet need. Among these, impairments in social functioning – manifesting as reduced adaptability and social withdrawal – are particularly disabling, as they persist beyond remission of positive symptoms and impede social reintegration. To investigate the neurobiological basis of behavioral impairments, we employed the tgDISC1 rat, a translational model overexpressing the human non-mutant Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) gene. This overexpression results in DISC1 protein aggregation and aberrant signaling– molecular features identified in a subset of schizophrenia patients identified by elevated DISC1 aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid. Behaviorally, the tgDISC1 rats exhibited a selective loss of social novelty preference in the 3-Chamber task while maintaining intact social interest, indicating a specific deficit in social adaptability rather than social motivation. Here, we tested whether continuous administration of atypical antipsychotics amisulpride or clozapine would rescue social deficits in tgDISC1 rats. Treatment with amisulpride (0.2 and 0.8 mg/kg/day for two weeks) fully restored social novelty preference, whereas clozapine had no effect. Control tasks for anhedonia, short-term working memory, and explorative behavior confirmed that their phenotype was not secondary to global motivational or cognitive impairments. Together, these findings demonstrate that amisulpride, a selective D2/D3 receptor antagonist, rescues social adaptability deficits linked to aberrant DISC1 signaling. The results also highlight the success of our precision psychiatry approach: the biological definition of a subset of schizophrenia by identifying DISC1 protein aggregates, the generation of a corresponding animal model and a successful pharmacotherapy of a clinically relevant phenotype.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract CD8 + T cells differentiate into diverse states that shape immune outcomes in cancer and chronic infection 1–4 . To define systematically the transcription factors (TFs) driving these states, we built a comprehensive atlas integrating transcriptional and epigenetic data across nine CD8 + T cell states and inferred TF activity profiles. Our analysis catalogued TF activity fingerprints, uncovering regulatory mechanisms governing selective cell state differentiation. Leveraging this platform, we focused on two transcriptionally similar but functionally opposing states that are critical in tumour and viral contexts: terminally exhausted T (TEX term ) cells, which are dysfunctional 5–8 , and tissue-resident memory T (T RM ) cells, which are protective 9–13 . Global TF community analysis revealed distinct biological pathways and TF-driven networks underlying protective versus dysfunctional states. Through in vivo CRISPR screening integrated with single-cell RNA sequencing (in vivo Perturb-seq) we delineated several TFs that selectively govern TEX term cell differentiation. We also identified HIC1 and GFI1 as shared regulators of TEX term and T RM cell differentiation and KLF6 as a unique regulator of T RM cells. We discovered new TEX term -selective TFs, including ZSCAN20 and JDP2, with no previous known function in T cells. Targeted deletion of these TFs enhanced tumour control and synergized with immune checkpoint blockade but did not interfere with T RM cell formation. Consistently, their depletion in human T cells reduces the expression of inhibitory receptors and improves effector function. By decoupling exhaustion T EX -selective from protective T RM cell programmes, our platform enables more precise engineering of T cell states, accelerating the rational design of more effective cellular immunotherapies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Body–brain communication has emerged as a key regulator of tissue homeostasis 1–5 . Solid tumours are innervated by different branches of the peripheral nervous system and increased tumour innervation is associated with poor cancer outcomes 6–8 . However, it remains unclear how the brain senses and responds to tumours in peripheral organs, and how tumour–brain communication influences cancer immunity. Here we identify a tumour–brain axis that promotes oncogenesis by establishing an immune-suppressive tumour microenvironment. Combining genetically engineered mouse models with neural tracing, tissue imaging and single-cell transcriptomics, we demonstrate that lung adenocarcinoma induces innervation and functional engagement of vagal sensory neurons, a major interoceptive system connecting visceral organs to the brain. Mechanistically, Npy2r -expressing vagal sensory nerves transmit signals from lung tumours to brainstem nuclei, driving elevated sympathetic efferent activity in the tumour microenvironment. This, in turn, suppresses anti-tumour immunity via β 2 adrenergic signalling in alveolar macrophages. Disruption of this sensory-to-sympathetic pathway through genetic, pharmacological or chemogenetic approaches significantly inhibited lung tumour growth by enhancing immune responses against cancer. Collectively, these results reveal a bidirectional tumour–brain communication involving vagal sensory input and sympathetic output that cooperatively regulate anti-cancer immunity; targeting this tumour–brain circuit may provide new treatments for visceral organ cancers.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related mortality and there are limited therapies 1 . Although endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are implicated in HCC, the involvement of the UPR transducer ATF6α remains unclear 2 . Here we demonstrate the function of ATF6α as an ER-stress-inducing tumour driver and metabolic master regulator restricting cancer immunosurveillance for HCC, in contrast to its well-characterized role as an adaptive response to ER stress 3 . ATF6α activation in human HCC is significantly correlated with an aggressive tumour phenotype, characterized by reduced patient survival, enhanced tumour progression and local immunosuppression. Hepatocyte-specific ATF6α activation in mice induced progressive hepatitis with ER stress, immunosuppression and hepatocyte proliferation. Concomitantly, activated ATF6α increased glycolysis and directly repressed the gluconeogenic enzyme FBP1 by binding to gene regulatory elements. Restoring FBP1 expression limited ATF6α-activation-related pathologies. Prolonged ATF6α activation in hepatocytes triggered hepatocarcinogenesis, intratumoural T cell infiltration and nutrient-deprived immune exhaustion. Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) 4 restored immunosurveillance and reduced HCC. Consistently, patients with HCC who achieved a complete response to immunotherapy displayed significantly increased ATF6α activation compared with those with a weaker response. Targeting Atf6 through germline ablation, hepatocyte-specific ablation or therapeutic hepatocyte delivery of antisense oligonucleotides dampened HCC in preclinical liver cancer models. Thus, prolonged ATF6α activation drives ER stress, leading to glycolysis-dependent immunosuppression in liver cancer and sensitizing to ICB. Our findings suggest that persistently activated ATF6α is a tumour driver, a potential stratification marker for ICB response and a therapeutic target for HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The loss of fur during human evolution has long mystified scientists and the public 1–5 . Reduced hair density coincides with acquisition of epidermal rete ridges, the developmental timing and molecular mechanisms of which are poorly understood despite their prominence in humans 1,6–9 . Examination of human and pig skin development has shown that rete ridges form through a mechanism independent from those of hair follicles 10,11 and sweat glands 3,4,12–15 by establishing interconnected epidermal invaginations. Here we document the occurrence of rete ridges across Mammalia, including in grizzly bears and dolphins, and show that neonatal pig wounds can regenerate them de novo. Multispecies spatiotemporal transcriptomics identifies significant signalling interactions between epidermal and dermal cells during rete ridge morphogenesis, particularly through bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP). We also demonstrate that mouse fingerpad skin forms rete ridges and functionally requires epidermal BMP signalling. We propose that evolution of rete ridges in mammalian skin involved replacement of the molecular program for formation of discrete microscopic appendages, including hair follicles and sweat glands, with a distinct program for the interconnected appendage network. Broad epidermal activation of BMP is required for the development of rete ridge networks organized around underlying dermal pockets. Understanding rete ridge mechanisms may enable development of therapeutic approaches to regenerate epidermal appendages lost during wounding or disease in humans.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Animals use 18–33-nucleotide PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to silence transposons in germ cells 1–3 . In addition to transposon-silencing piRNAs, placental mammals make pachytene piRNAs 4,5 , an abundant class of testis-specific small RNAs derived from long noncoding RNA precursors. Although the sites of pachytene piRNA precursor transcription are often conserved among placental mammals, the sequences of the piRNAs themselves are rapidly diverging, even in the human population 6 . Consequently, the biological function and mechanism of action of pachytene piRNAs remain debated. Here we report that most mouse pachytene piRNAs have no biological function but instead ‘selfishly’ promote their own production. Our data suggest that pachytene piRNAs direct endonucleolytic cleavage of partially complementary targets and neither activate nor repress mRNA translation. Although many pachytene piRNAs guide cleavage of specific mRNAs, few alter the steady-state abundance of their targets. The minority of pachytene piRNAs that reduce target mRNA abundance enhance sperm fitness, thereby ensuring production of the entire pachytene piRNA repertoire. Together, our findings explain the lack of conservation of most pachytene piRNA sequences and suggest that these ‘selfish’ small RNAs persist in mammalian evolution because target cleavage by a tiny minority of piRNAs supports male fertility.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA molecules that enable horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, often conferring advantages such as antibiotic resistance. Despite their importance, plasmids are underrepresented in genomic databases because of challenges in assembling them, caused by mosaicism and microdiversity. Current plasmid assemblers rely on detecting circular paths in single-sample assembly graphs but face limitations because of graph fragmentation, entanglement and low coverage. We introduce PlasMAAG (plasmid and organism metagenomic binning using assembly–alignment graphs), a method to recover plasmids and cellular genomes from metagenomic samples. PlasMAAG complements assembly graph signals across samples by generating an ‘assembly–alignment graph’, which is used alongside common binning features for improved plasmid reconstruction. On synthetic benchmark datasets, PlasMAAG reconstructed 50–121% more near-complete plasmids than competing methods and improved the Matthews correlation coefficient of geNomad contig classification by 28–106%. On hospital sewage samples, PlasMAAG outperformed competing methods, reconstructing 33% more plasmid sequences.

TRIDENT-1 is a registrational phase 1/2 trial assessing repotrectinib, a next-generation ROS1/TRK TKI, in adults with advanced solid tumors, including NTRK + disease. The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response; secondary endpoints included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival and safety. Median follow-up ranged between 21.3 months and 25.7 months. In the TKI-naive cohort ( n = 51; 95% confidence interval (CI)), the response rate was 59% (44–72); the median DOR was not estimable (NE); and the median PFS was 30.3 months (9.0–NE). In the TKI-pretreated cohort ( n = 69; 95% CI), the response rate was 48% (36–60); the median DOR was 9.8 months (7.4–13.0); and the median PFS was 7.4 months (3.9–9.7).

Intracranial responses were observed in two of three TKI-naive patients and in four of six TKI-pretreated patients with measurable intracranial disease at baseline. Among all treated patients ( n = 565), the most common any-grade treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) was dizziness (57%); most TRAEs were low grade; and 4% discontinued repotrectinib due to a TRAE. Here repotrectinib demonstrated durable systemic and intracranial responses with generally low-grade adverse events in patients with NTRK + solid tumors, including those with previous TRK TKI treatment and solvent front mutations.

OMC25 comprises diverse chemical compounds capable of forming different intermolecular interactions and a wide range of crystal packing motifs. We provide information on the dataset’s construction, composition, and properties. To demonstrate the quality and use cases of OMC25, we trained and evaluated state-of-the-art open-source machine learning interatomic potentials.

    "Abstract": "Erythrosine B (EB) is a food colorant and antiviral xanthene dye that is widely used as a color additive in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. Its application as a sensor for spectrophotometric measurement of amine-based pharmaceuticals offers several benefits due to its availability, low cost, quick labeling, and high sensitivity. In the present study, a quick, sensitive and simple green spectrophotometric method has been developed to assay Bromhexine Hydrochloride (BMH) in pure form and its pharmaceutical formulation. The spectrophotometric methodology reveals complex development between the drug and erythrosine B at 556 nm at pH 3.6. The spectrophotometric absorbance-concentration curve is linear over the ranges (1.0-9.0 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>) with low detection limit 0.199 μg mL<sup>-1</sup> and low quantification limit 0.605 μg mL<sup>-1</sup>. The developed approach was assessed for linearity, accuracy, precision, limits of detection, and limits of quantitation in compliance with International Council for Harmonisation validation recommendations. Lastly, the suggested approach has been successfully implemented to quantify the cited medication colorimetrically in its dosage form with excellent recoveries. Also, the greenness of the suggested approach was measured by some of the recent green analytical measures as applications to our presented methodology show further access to this study.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Satellite imagery can play a crucial role in disaster management, but critical images often take hours or even days to reach end-users, and upgrading hardware to improve transmission speed is prohibitively expensive for many small satellite missions. This article thus explores onboard change detection methods as a cost-effective alternative to reduce reaction time. Building on RaVAEn, we introduce STTORM-CD, a framework that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a triplet loss, specifically designed for change detection. The triplet loss improves detection accuracy while maintaining the computational and storage efficiency of VAE, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained satellite hardware. To support training and evaluation, we present a new dataset, STTORM-CD-Floods, annotated with a custom strategy optimized for flood detection, along with new metrics, AURC and RDP, designed to address limitations of RaVAEn evaluation strategies, which are influenced more by dataset composition than model performance. Our experiments show that STTORM-CD outperforms existing flood detection methods, achieving an increase of 35 percentage points (pp) in custom AURC and standard AUPRC metrics against RaVAEn on the presented STTORM-CD-Floods dataset, while showing negligible changes in AURC (approximately -4 to +0.1 pp) for landslides and wildfires. This demonstrates that improvements on one disaster type do not necessarily compromise performance on others and highlights the potential for a universal and accurate real-time disaster detection system.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Immersive Virtual Reality (iVR) interventions have emerged as effective complements to conventional rehabilitation, with advantages in terms of flexible parametrization, extended data recording and patient engagement. Home-rehabilitation is another impactful, yet unexplored potential. A key requirement is ensuring that patients execute tasks with proper motor coordination and postural awareness: to this end, tactile sensory feedback can be introduced to enhance both immersion and motor guidance. We investigate here the efficacy and the effects on motor coordination of tactile guidance provided within an iVR rehabilitation serious game. A wearable haptic armband, delivering directional continuous and vibrotactile feedback, has been developed to guide grasping and pronosupination tasks. We evaluated the interaction on motor control and task execution using objective performance metrics, biomechanical responses, and subjective assessments, in a group of 12 healthy subjects, and a preliminary feasibility study with two participants with stroke. Findings show that haptic guidance in iVR statistically significantly enhances movement precision, reduces variability, and induces adaptive changes in muscle coordination. Feedback from clinical tests further indicates preliminary indications of usability and acceptability of the developed technology as part of a rehabilitation program. These results underscore the promise of haptic-enriched iVR systems for advancing both clinical and home-based motor rehabilitation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Hybrid beamforming is a promising approach to alleviate hardware complexity in multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems while maintaining high data rate performance. Unfortunately, hybrid beamforming architecture design is a challenging non-convex optimization problem due to stringent hardware constraints. However, traditional hybrid beamforming design methods, such as alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithms, rely on iterative optimization procedures that introduce heavy computational overhead and make them impractical for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based hybrid beamforming method (DL-HBF) that aims to reduce computational latency while achieving acceptable sum-rate performance. Furthermore, we evaluate these methods based on a realistic channel model to ensure practical significance and their performance on imperfect channel state information (CSI). Additionally, we propose dataset generation procedures, which reduce the dataset creation and training overhead compared to existing DL-based hybrid beamforming methods that help in rapid deployment and scalability. Simulation results show that the proposed DL-HBF achieves an acceptable sum rate compared to traditional methods while reducing the computational complexity and maintaining robustness against channel estimation errors, which provides a practical solution for real-time hybrid beamforming for next-generation wireless systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with multiple systemic complications, including cognitive decline and increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases. The glymphatic system, a brain waste-clearance pathway that can be impaired by sleep disturbances common in T2DM, has not yet been examined in the condition. Therefore, the aim was to evaluate glymphatic system in T2DM subjects using diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index. A total of 78 T2DM adults and 106 healthy controls underwent brain MRI. Sleep issues were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and cognition with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Group differences in DTI-ALPS, sleep metrics, and MoCA scores were assessed with analysis of covariance (covariates, age, sex, and BMI). Other covariates (MoCA, ESS, and sleep apnea status) were also included to examine DTI-ALPS differences between groups, in addition to age, sex and BMI. Correlations analyses were performed to assess associations between sleep measures (PSQI and ESS), disease duration, HbA1c levels, and DTI-ALPS indices in T2DM adults. T2DM patients exhibited higher PSQI ( p = 0.03) and ESS ( p = 0.004), reflecting poorer sleep quality and increased daytime sleepiness. MoCA scores were significantly lower in T2DM adults ( p = 0.001), with impairments emerged in visuospatial skills, attention, and language. Also, significantly reduced DTI-ALPS values appeared in T2DM over controls ( p = 0.017), but no significant associations were found between DTI-ALPS index and other measures in T2DM adults. T2DM adults show impaired glymphatic function along with poor sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. The findings indicate that glymphatic dysfunction, potentially-driven by metabolic, vascular, and sleep-related disturbances may exacerbate cognitive deficits in T2DM adults.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Partial human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping is increasingly used to triage high-risk (HR)-HPV-positive women in national cervical cancer screening. This study evaluated whether separate triage for HPV genotypes 16 and 18 could enhance the effectiveness of Finland’s program. Data from 76,482 women participating in primary HPV screening in Tampere and surrounding municipalities (2012–2023) were analyzed. Partial genotyping identified HPV16, HPV18, and 12 other HR-HPV-types, and the association between genotype and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse (HSIL +) detection was assessed. Among 6031 HR-HPV-positive women, HSIL + prevalence was highest in HPV16-positive women (37.3%) followed by HPV18 (26.0%) and other HR-HPV types (20.3%). HSIL + detection declined with age: 26.2%(age &lt; 45), 15.9%(age 45–50), and 11%(age &gt; 50)( p &lt; 0.001). HPV16 showed the highest persistence upon re-testing (69.6% single; 84.6% co-infections), compared to 53.8% for other HR-HPV types. Among women with NILM cytology, HPV16 infections conferred a significantly higher risk of HSIL + compared to infections with other HR-HPV types. This risk was evident for both single HPV16 infection (OR 2.41;95%CI:1.55–3.75) and HPV16 coinfections (OR 3.86;95%CI:2.14–6.96). These findings support the integration of age-specific strategies and partial HPV16/18 genotyping into Finland’s screening program. A refined triage model, including immediate colposcopy referral for HPV16/18-positive women, could improve patient management and screening efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a vital role in protecting computer networks from malicious activities. Dimensionality reduction techniques are commonly employed to enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of machine learning based IDS. In this study, we proposed an effective dimensionality reduction technique called feature importance-based autoencoder (FI-AE) for intrusion detection systems. Our proposed approach encompasses several key components. First, we introduce a novel feature importance method known as one-versus-all feature importance (OVA), which utilizes a random forest algorithm. Next, we train an autoencoder model using a weighted loss function that takes into account the feature importance values obtained through the OVA method. Finally, we utilized the trained autoencoder to reduce the number of features in the benchmark datasets, followed by the application of a random forest classifier to the reduced datasets. We tested our proposed model using three well-known datasets, namely NSL-KDD, UNSW-NB15, and CIC-IDS2017. The experiments revealed that the random forest classifier, combined with our proposed model, outperformed previous dimensionality reduction techniques in terms of accuracy and F1-score.",

    "Abstract": "This study presents an in-depth numerical investigation of the dynamic and mechanical performance of architected, strut-based lattice structures, with a critical emphasis on auxetic topologies, such as double pyramids with and without lateral supports. Finite element simulations using both high-fidelity (actual) and low-fidelity (homogenized) models are carried out across various lattice geometries, including octet, diamond, cubic variants, and double pyramids, spanning unit cell configurations from 1 × 1 × 1 to 5 × 5 × 5. The modal analysis reveals that homogenized models provide excellent agreement for geometrically regular and isotropic lattices, such as the octet. However, they tend to significantly overpredict lower-order natural frequencies in complex or auxetic architectures, especially at smaller scales. A threshold of 3 × 3 × 3 unit cells is identified for achieving reliable homogenization in anisotropic lattices. Effective mechanical properties using periodic boundary conditions were also studied, confirming auxetic behavior (negative Poisson's ratio) in selected configurations. Furthermore, the inclusion of rounded fillets at sharp junctions in the lattices enhances both stiffness and modal accuracy. Notably, modal degeneracy observed in specific symmetric geometries underscores the role of topology in vibrational behavior. This work offers comprehensive design guidance for tailoring lattice-based materials in high-performance applications, enabling optimized fidelity selection and resonance avoidance strategies in aerospace, biomedical, and multifunctional composite systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) represents a critical ophthalmological pathology affecting premature infants, with established associations to low birth weight (BW) and early gestational age (GA). Elevated risk of severe ROP, which can result in irreversible vision loss, is observed in infants exhibiting lower BW and GA. This research investigates the development of an automated diagnostic system designed to classify Plus disease, a marker of abnormal retinal vascularity, and ROP staging, a determinant of disease progression. Specifically, the model facilitates binary classification of Plus disease (Plus/Normal) and multi-class classification of ROP stage (Stage 0, 1, 2, 3) using a meticulously curated dataset of retinal fundus images. The proposed model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy, achieving 0.996 for Plus disease detection and 0.98 for ROP stage classification. These results suggest potential clinical utility for automated ROP screening methodologies in supporting timely diagnosis and intervention in similar settings, pending multi-center validation, which could help reduce the incidence of vision impairment in preterm populations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background While endocytoscopy allows for in vivo cellular-level observation, achieving high-quality staining remains a technical challenge. Aims To develop and validate a simple, reliable scale for assessing and improving endocytoscopic staining quality. Methods We developed a four-dimension staining quality score and validated it on a retrospective image cohort (n = 2692). The scale’s reliability, validity, and internal consistency were assessed, and associated factors were identified using multinomial regression. The scale was then externally validated in a separate retrospective image cohort (n = 2413) to confirm its clinical applicability. Results The scale showed inter-rater agreement (ICC = 0.992) and reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.81), with a single principal factor explaining 62.3% of variance.The Spearman correlation between the gold standard score and AOD value was 0.81. Staining quality was influenced by lesion characteristics and physician experience (P &lt; 0.05). After one month of training, junior physicians showed improved agreement with gold standard scores, with Kappa values rising from 0.61, 0.66, and 0.69 to 0.81, 0.83, and 0.82. Higher staining quality was also significantly associated with better concordance between Endocytoscopy imaging and histopathology (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion This endocytoscopic staining quality score is a reliable and valid tool to guide technique refinement and improve diagnostic accuracy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Understanding ocean transport is critical for applications ranging from fisheries to chemical plume tracking and carbon dioxide removal modeling. However, available hydrodynamic data often lack the spatial resolution needed for effective transport simulations. We apply statistical downscaling to coarse-resolution ocean reanalysis and atmospheric wind data, reconstructing fine-scale fields validated against high-resolution dynamic models in the Bering Sea. This enables the prediction of transport patterns without the need to run high resolution physics simulations, saving computational costs and time. We examined five years of high-resolution, statistically downscaled ocean currents and surface winds and found that the correlation of ocean current and wind components with GLORYS and ERA5 reanalysis models were r = 0.87 and r = 0.98. The Liu-mean skill score was 0.75 for ocean current velocity. Okubo–Weiss analyses showed comparable vorticity and shear between downscaled and dynamical models. The Finite-time Layupanov Exponent analysis showed consistent Lagrangian Cohesive Structures across datasets. Multi-year particle tracking using both downscaled and reanalysis forcing showed consistent relative separation distances with mean Bhattacharyya coefficient of 0.720 ± 0.133. The demonstrated parity in dispersal patterns indicates statistically downscaled approaches can substitute dynamical models for large-scale applications. Future work should validate these results across diverse oceanographic regimes and incorporate biogeochemical feedback mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Cognitive impairments are frequently observed in patients with panic disorder (PD), yet the relationship between sleep quality and cognitive recovery remains underexplored. This study investigated whether improvements in sleep quality during routine psychiatric care are prospectively associated with changes in decision-making in PD. Eighty-one patients with PD and 81 healthy controls were assessed using standardized clinical and cognitive measures, including the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Iowa Gambling Task. After three months of naturalistic follow-up, 38 patients were reassessed. Patients with PD initially exhibited significantly poorer sleep quality, more severe symptoms, and greater cognitive impairment than controls. Over the follow-up period, both clinical symptoms and sleep quality improved. Notably, improvements in sleep quality were independently associated with better performance on the Iowa Gambling Task, suggesting a relationship with decision-making performance. Changes in executive function showed only a non-significant trend in relation to sleep improvement. These findings suggest that improved sleep quality is independently associated with cognitive improvements, particularly decision-making, in PD. Addressing sleep disturbances in clinical care may be crucial for optimizing cognitive outcomes in patients with panic disorder.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Activities of daily living, including grasping, holding, and pinching, are essential for independence but often become difficult for individuals with cerebrovascular disease owing to upper limb paralysis. We investigated the relationship between adjustability of grasping force (AGF), defined as the ability to adjust grasping force, and upper limb/hand functional performance. Twelve individuals with mild cerebrovascular disorders participated in this preliminary cross-sectional study. Assessments included the AGF task using iWakka, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, Simple Test for Evaluating Hand Function, Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), and Motor Activity Log (MAL). AGF was quantified using the AGF score, calculated as the absolute error between target and actual grasping force; lower AGF scores indicate better AGF. Partial Spearman’s rank correlations, adjusted for age, revealed that AGF score (isometric section) on the less-affected side was negatively and positively correlated with ARAT and MAL (Quality of Movement) on the less-affected and more-affected sides, respectively. These findings suggest that better AGF on the less-affected side may enhance motor performance on that side but could be associated with lower perceived movement quality on the more-affected side. This highlights the complex role of the less-affected side in post-stroke function and suggests that rehabilitation strategies should consider AGF on both sides of the body.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Management of neonates with hypoplastic left heart syndrome following the Norwood procedure seeks to optimize systemic oxygen delivery while maintaining an appropriate distribution between systemic and pulmonary blood flow. The objective of this study was to quantify actively circulating blood volume, total cardiac output, the pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Qs), and vascular resistance indices at fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.21, 0.5, and 0.9 during the early postoperative period. Measurements were obtained in 16 neonates using an ultrasound dilution technique that determines hemodynamic variables from changes in blood ultrasound velocity following injection of isotonic saline (COstatus, Transonic Systems Inc.). An increase in the Qp/Qs ratio was observed with rising FiO2, which was associated with a reduction in systemic blood flow, while pulmonary blood flow remained statistically unchanged across the FiO2 levels studied. This pattern is consistent with the interpretation that pulmonary blood flow in this setting is mainly influenced by the mechanical properties of the right ventricle to pulmonary artery shunt rather than by FiO2 mediated changes in pulmonary vascular tone. Actively circulating volume index was reduced at baseline and decreased further with increasing FiO2 accompanied by an increase in systemic vascular resistance. These findings indicate that the early postoperative hemodynamics in neonates after the Norwood procedure are more responsive to alterations in systemic circulation than to modulation of pulmonary vascular tone. Therapeutic strategies targeting augmentation of circulating blood volume and reduction of systemic afterload warrant further investigation as potential approaches to optimize postoperative management in this population.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Focal deficits in ischaemic stroke arise primarily from impaired perfusion downstream of a critical vascular occlusion. Though the consequent parenchymal lesion is traditionally used to predict clinical deficits, the underlying pattern of disrupted perfusion provides information upstream of the lesion, potentially yielding earlier predictive and localising signals. We previously developed a technique to compute perfusion maps from routine CT and CT angiography (CTA), an imaging modality widely deployed in clinical practice and available at large data scales. Analysing computed perfusion maps (derived from CT and CTA) from 1393 CTA-imaged patients with confirmed acute ischaemic stroke, here we use deep generative perfusion-deficit inference to localise the neural substrates of NIHSS sub-scores, explicitly disentangling the distinct topologies of disrupted perfusion and neural dependence. We show that our approach replicates known lesion-deficit relations without knowledge of the lesion itself and reveals novel neural dependents. The high achieved anatomical fidelity suggests acute CTA-derived computed perfusion maps may be of substantial clinical and scientific value in rich phenotyping of acute stroke. By relying only on an imaging modality well-established in the hyperacute setting, deep generative perfusion-deficit inference could power highly expressive models of functional anatomical relations in ischaemic stroke within the critical pre-interventional window.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Interleukin-6 (IL-6) drives metabolic and inflammatory processes central to disease. Current knowledge implicates epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of these pathways, including through the methylation of CpG sites. This blood-based meta-analysis of three cohorts (n = 4,361) identifies 401 IL-6–associated CpGs enriched in regulatory regions and linked to key immunometabolic genes, including AIM2 , MTOR , and IL6R . Three complementary causal inference approaches support most sites as responding to IL-6, with SOCS3 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signalling 3) methylation statistically mediating inflammatory bowel disease risk. Notably, one CpG connected to NFATC2IP (Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells 2 Interacting Protein) plausibly influences both IL-6 production and multiple immunometabolic conditions, including body mass index and type 2 diabetes. Collectively, our results map the DNA methylation landscape surrounding circulating IL-6 levels and unveil directional effects and distinct functional relationships between epigenetics and inflammation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Terahertz-frequency (THz) carrier waves in free-space optical (FSO) communications offer the potential for &gt; 1 Tbit/s data rates and stable latency. They offer wider bandwidths than available in the microwave region, together with reduced scattering and relaxed pointing requirements compared with visible and near-infrared regions. However, 1–10 THz FSO communications systems have thus far been limited to data rates several orders of magnitude lower than those of infrared systems. This work describes an experimental demonstration of multi-gigabit-per-second FSO communication using a THz quantum cascade laser (QCL), opening a new frontier for next-generation wireless communications. The FSO communication system consists of a 2.4 THz QCL source as the transmitter and a room-temperature Schottky barrier diode detector as the receiver. By directly modulating the terahertz QCL, we achieved non-return-to-zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK) with a transmission rate of up to 4 Gbit/s. We evaluated the performance of the communication link by analyzing the bit error rate (BER) of the demodulated signal at the receiver while examining its relation to received optical power, QCL modulation power, and various bias points. Our work establishes the foundation for high-speed optical wireless communication based on terahertz QCL technology systems.",

Asylum seeking and refugee minors (ASRM) are particularly exposed to risk factors for mental health problems. Yet, there is a lack of comprehensive data on the prevalence of specific mental health problems as well as applied screening and follow-up care in Germany. Methods Using the online platform REDCap, we conducted the cross-sectional SAVE-KID survey among health and social care professionals (HSCP) working with ASRM in Germany (n = 201; 44% medical doctors, 38% social workers) to assess the estimated mental health burden among ASRM, the conducted screening measures, and provided mental health care as well as the extent to which communication problems affect care for ASRM. Results Here we show, that on average, 21% of ASRM are reported with one or more listed mental health problem. Only 37% receive follow-up. Less than 24% of participants conduct mental health screening by informal questions, interviews, trained staff or questionnaires. 84% of participants report frequent communication problems. Most used aids are online tools or relatives’ translations. Conclusions SAVE-KID describes an imbalance between the occurrence of and screening for mental health problems among ASRM. Comprehensive, systematic detection of mental health problems remains challenging due to communication problems, lack of specialized staff and diagnostic tools as well as follow-up care structures.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among speech discrimination at 9 months of age, word recognition at 30 months of age, and mean length of utterance in morphemes (MLUm) at 33 months of age among children who are hard of hearing (CHH) and children with normal hearing (CNH). This study also explored early sociodemographic and audiological variables that may influence communication outcomes in CHH and CNH. Method: Participants included 18 CNH and 32 CHH with early and well-fit hearing aids (HAs). Measures included speech discrimination in response to vowel and consonant stimuli at 9 months, word recognition at 30 months, and a spontaneous language sample at 33 months. Results: Group-level differences were not observed in speech discrimination or word recognition but emerged for language outcomes. Specifically for language outcomes, CHH had shorter MLUms and produced fewer mental state verbs than CNH. Vowel discrimination and word recognition were related to each other, and word recognition was related to MLUm. Consonant discrimination did not relate to any other variables. Higher MLUm was related to maternal level of education, hearing status, and daily device use. Additionally, daily device use at both 9 and 30 months correlated with word recognition at 30 months. Conclusions: Early auditory measures (speech discrimination and daily device use) relate to later speech recognition and MLUm in young children wearing well-fit HAs. Clinicians should consider these early metrics, as well as spontaneous language samples to capture real-world conversational skills, to identify young CHH at risk for poorer language outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study sought to provide comprehensive insights into the size of articulatory movements (stroke amplitudes) in talkers with Parkinson's disease (PD) and determine the extent to which hypokinesia is related to perceived articulatory subsystem impairment severity. Method: Forty talkers with PD and 40 controls participated. Perceptual ratings of the articulatory and phonatory subsystem impairment severity were obtained for all talkers with PD. On the basis of these ratings, the PD group was divided into talkers with and without an articulatory impairment (18 PDdys+artic, 22 PDdys−artic). Jaw, lower lip, anterior tongue, and posterior tongue movements were recorded during a paragraph reading task using three-dimensional electromagnetic articulography. Stroke amplitudes of all opening and closing movements were measured for each articulator, and frequency distributions across seven or 12 amplitude levels were established for the jaw and lower lip/tongue, respectively. To determine hypokinesia, stroke counts were compared among the two PD subgroups and controls at each amplitude level for each articulator. Articulatory impairment severity ratings of the PDdys+artic subgroup were correlated with the stroke counts at higher amplitude levels. Results: Group × Amplitude Level interactions were significant for all articulators. Post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that the PDdys+artic subgroup produced significantly more tongue and lower lip strokes with small amplitudes and significantly less tongue and lower lip strokes with large amplitudes than controls, at times also the PDdys−artic subgroup. At a higher amplitude level, the PDdys−artic subgroup produced significantly less posterior tongue strokes than controls. However, post hoc group comparisons for jaw strokes were nonsignificant at all amplitude levels. Significant inverse correlations were found between tongue stroke counts and articulatory impairment severity ratings. Conclusions: Findings suggest that hypokinesia manifests in the tongue and lip more so than in the jaw. Only hypokinesia of the tongue may be reflected in severity ratings of articulatory subsystem impairment.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to address the critical gap in research on real-time language processing in adults with developmental language disorder (DLD). We examine whether adults with DLD continue to exhibit differences in the dynamics of spoken word recognition observed in childhood or whether these differences resolve by adulthood. Additionally, drawing on data from the Iowa Longitudinal Study, we investigate how individual differences in adult word recognition are shaped by early childhood language abilities. Method: Adults aged 34–36 years ( n = 71; 28 with a childhood diagnosis of DLD) were recruited from a cohort of individuals who participated in the Iowa Longitudinal Study. The dynamics of spoken word recognition were assessed using eye tracking in the visual world paradigm in which participants heard a word and selected the correct visual referent from a display of four images: the target (“money”), phonological competitors (cohort [e.g., “mother”] or rhyme [e.g., “honey”]), and unrelated items (“whistle” and “blanket”). Results: We analyzed eye fixations to the target to assess the degree and speed of recognition and fixations to competitors to evaluate the timing and strength of lexical competition across groups. Adults with DLD activated targets and competitors similarly to adults with typical language, no longer exhibiting deficits found in childhood. However, across groups, both regression and principal component analyses revealed that individual differences in language scores in kindergarten are strongly linked to the dynamics of word recognition 30 years later. Conclusions: Results suggest that, by adulthood, the dynamics underlying spoken word recognition for familiar words are largely similar in adults with and without DLD. However, individual differences in spoken word recognition in adulthood are strongly predicted by language ability in kindergarten. Findings emphasize the role of early language skills in laying the foundation for basic language processes in adulthood and underscore the importance of viewing language ability as a continuous spectrum rather than a categorical construct.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The dynamic capacitated arc routing problem (DCARP) aims to update the service paths of vehicles in the capacitated arc routing problem when uncertain factors deteriorate the current schedule of vehicles' services. A DCARP scenario comprises a series of DCARP instances that share similarities with each other. Therefore, optimisation experience gained from solving the former DCARP instance can potentially facilitate the optimisation for a new DCARP instance. However, existing optimisation algorithms for solving DCARP seldom consider such optimisation experience and instead re‐optimise the DCARP instance from scratch. This paper proposes a dynamic optimisation framework with a solution building block adaptation strategy (DO‐SBBA) that extracts the optimisation experience from the former optimisation process to facilitate the optimisation of the next DCARP instance. The framework introduces the concept of building blocks for extracting the valuable experience contained in historical solutions. The building block‐based constructive heuristic is proposed to handle DCARP scenarios with cost‐ or task‐changing dynamic events, and an insertion heuristic is proposed to handle task‐changing dynamic events. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of DO‐SBBA for extracting and utilising optimisation experience in DCARP scenarios, significantly improving the performance of dynamic optimisation compared to state‐of‐the‐art DCARP methods.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Guidelines recommend placement of inferior vena cava filters (IVCF) in patients with acute proximal lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and a contraindication to anticoagulation. IVCF placement during pregnancy or immediately postpartum presents technical challenges and is not extensively described in the existing literature. Objective(s): To describe the use of IVCF in the obstetric population along with outcomes related to filter placement. Methods: Retrospective chart review of all patients at Mayo Clinic from 2001-2020 with an IVCF at the time of conception or who underwent placement during pregnancy/postpartum. Results: 24 pregnancies in 23 women (mean age 26.3 years, range 18-41) were included: 5 (21%) with IVCF placement prior to pregnancy, 7 (29%) during pregnancy, and 12 (50%) during postpartum. IVCF placed during pregnancy were frequently in the suprarenal position, in 5 (71%) cases. Meanwhile, 16 (94%) were deployed in an infrarenal position prior to pregnancy and postpartum. Complications included multiple attempts to remove the IVCF (n=2), severe angulation (n=4), embedded struts (n=3), fracture (n=1), and one case of cardiac tamponade (n=1). Complications were more common when placement was performed prior to pregnancy or during pregnancy (2, 40% and 4, 57% respectively) versus postpartum (2, 17%). Conclusion(s): IVCF placement prior or during pregnancy/ postpartum is uncommon and is associated with a high incidence of complications, although most did not fundamentally impact clinical outcomes. While IVCF remain an option for clinicians treating pregnant and postpartum patients, these should be considered as a last resource.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The efficacy of uncovered self-expandable metal stents (UCSEMS) compared to that of fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMS) for distal malignant biliary obstruction (dMBO) is controversial. Studies have highlighted the heterogeneity of disease conditions because pancreatic and nonpancreatic cancers exhibit different clinical courses. This is the first study to specifically compare the safety and efficacy of UCSEMS and FCSEMS for dMBO caused by nonpancreatic cancer. Methods: This retrospective multicenter study included patients who underwent UCSEMS or FCSEMS placement for nonpancreatic cancer-induced dMBO at four centers between January 2010 and April 2024. Propensity score matching (1:1) of both groups was performed. Technical and clinical success, adverse events, recurrent biliary obstruction (RBO), time to RBO (TRBO), and overall survival (OS) of these groups were compared. Results: After propensity score matching, 24 patients were included in each group. Technical and clinical success rates and TRBO did not differ significantly between the groups (median TRBO: 311 days [UCSEMS] vs 317 days [FCSEMS]; P=0.42). Similarly, OS was not significantly different (median OS: 432 days [UCSEMS] vs 190 days [FCSEMS]; P=0.083). The postendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis incidence of the UCSEMS group was significantly lower than that of the FCSEMS group (4.2% vs. 33%; P=0.023). Conclusions: UCSEMS may be safer than FCSEMS for managing dMBO caused by nonpancreatic cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Wound failure after posterior spine surgery can lead to infection, hardware loss, and reoperation. Prophylactic paraspinous muscle flaps are used selectively, but criteria to select which patients benefit most have not been consistent. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study (2011–2022) of complex posterior spine operations closed by plastic surgery at a single center. The exposure was prophylactic paraspinous flap at the index operation versus standard primary closure. The primary outcome was a plastic surgery–managed wound complication requiring clinical intervention or return to the operating room. Using only routine pre and intraoperative variables, we created a five factor bedside score (obesity; lumbar/sacral level; albumin &lt;35 g/L (3.5 g/dL); operative time &gt;250 minutes; American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] class ≥3) and a parallel logistic model that excluded treatment to estimate baseline risk and support decision making. Results: Among 281 operations, 150/281 (53%) received prophylactic paraspinous closure. Plastic-surgery–managed wound complications occurred in 35/281 (12.5%). A simple baseline-risk model separated patients into Low, Intermediate, and High-risk groups with observed complication rates of 7.9%, 11.7%, and 23.2%, respectively. Model performance was modest (area under the ROC curve [AUC] 0.66; optimism-corrected AUC 0.56; Brier 0.106). In adjusted analyses, ASA ≥3 was associated with higher odds of a wound complication (adjusted OR 9.35; 95% CI, 1.20–73.02). In the High-risk (4–5 points) group of the five-factor score, prophylactic closure reduced reoperations from 20.0% (4/20) to 0% (0/27) (absolute risk reduction [ARR] 20%; number needed to treat [NNT] 5; p=0.027). No significant differences were seen in the lower-risk groups. Conclusion: A simple five factor score stratifies baseline wound risk after posterior spine surgery and identifies patients most likely to benefit from prophylactic paraspinous flap closure. Selective, preoperative use in high risk patients may reduce returns to the operating room.",

    "Abstract": "Incidence of ankle sprain and chronic ankle instability is higher in women versus men. One sex-specific factor may be the greater ligamentous laxity in women compared with men, potentially influenced by estrogen and relaxin activity. This study aimed to investigate changes in ankle joint laxity and its association with hormone levels in women with and without recurrent ankle sprains. Eleven female college students with recurrent ankle sprains and seven students with no or a single prior sprain participated. Ankle joint laxity was assessed using an ankle arthrometer with a 125-N load for anterior-posterior displacement and inversion-eversion rotation. Serum estradiol (E2) and relaxin-2 levels were measured. Ankle laxity assessments and blood sampling were performed in the follicular, ovulation, and luteal phases of the participant’s individual menstrual cycle. A significant group × phase interaction was found for inversion-eversion ankle joint laxity; however, post hoc analyses adjusted for Bonferroni multiple comparisons were not significant, implying a lack of clinical interest or potential sampling fluctuations. A positive correlation was found between serum relaxin-2 level and anterior–posterior ankle joint laxity during the luteal phase (r = 0.557, p = 0.048). This association should be interpreted as an observational finding that may help generate hypotheses regarding potential hormone-related factors in in ankle sprains in women.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The years 2020 and 2021 were peculiar due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which may also have had an impact on people with colorectal cancer (CRC). In the state of Bahia, Brazil, Hospital Aristides Maltez (HAM) is responsible for most of the oncological care, including malignant neoplasms of colon and rectum. Considering that most of metastatic CRC cases are no longer curable, evaluate if there was an increase in the proportion of that stage of disease can serve as a metric of the impact of this epidemic. Retrospective analysis of HAM's electronic medical records of patients with CRC that had their first consultation during the first 12 months of COVID-19 epidemic at Bahia, in comparison to those that had their first consultation during the 12 previous months. Main characteristics of both groups were similar. Median age was 63 years old, with near representation of both genders, and predominance of brown skin color and a low level of education. However, in the first year of COVID-19 epidemic, there was a 26.89% increase of subjects with already metastatic CRC in the first medical evaluation at HAM (although without statistical significance). We found a numerical increase in metastatic CRC in the COVID period cohort. In consonance with this, another Brazilian study found an increase in the proportion of new cases of advanced CRC, between March and July 2020, in comparison to the same period in 2019. Moreover, in another publication, an increase in colorectal cancer mortality in USA is projected due to delays in screening and diagnosing during the COVID-19 pandemic. These results urge attention to CRC in the following years and in the next pandemic.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Ontological security theory has increasingly informed research in international relations, yet its insights remain largely absent from policymaking. This article seeks to bridge that gap by offering a policy-oriented framework grounded in ontological security theory. Given the field’s theoretical diversity, practical indeterminacy, and normative complexity, translating its insights into policy guidance presents significant challenges. To address these, I propose a two-step approach. First, I identify three dilemmas that actors often face: the tension between ontological and physical security; the dissonance between competing internal identities (a dissonance dilemma ); and the trade-off between actors’ own security and that of others (a spiral dilemma ). These dilemmas underscore key tensions in decision-making and help render ontological concerns more actionable. Second, I outline three mechanisms for addressing these dilemmas: identifying sources of ontological insecurity; assessing the broader implications of security measures; and avoiding actions that needlessly threaten others’ ontological security. Rather than prescribing specific policies, this framework aims to sensitize policymakers to ontological dynamics and provide conceptual tools for navigating them. Recognizing such dilemmas can help prevent destabilizing behavior and foster more reflexive, conscious policy practices.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Two versions of the same story of Adonis’s mother, Myrrha, were published within six years in the early seventeenth century. Epyllia by William Barksted (1607) and Henry Austin (1613) each retold Ovid’s etiology of myrrh. In the Metamorphoses , Myrrha seduces her biological father, Cinyras, the king of Cyprus, and eventually becomes a myrrh tree. While we have revisionist accounts of Myrrha in feminist histories of sexuality, her race and that of Cinyras have been ignored. Austin’s version condemns his heroine as a hypersexual Ottoman woman who threatens white English futurity and its linear family trees, while Barksted and his male literary collaborators perfume Shakespeare and his literary corpus with an anadem of myrrh. As they graft their poems to his, these men experiment with queer and Black identities across gender, using the plant kingdom to reimagine the generative afterlives of texts that preserve, inhabit, and challenge the dead. Still, in their selective interpretations of Ovid and use of early modern racial grammar, both seventeenth-century epyllia underscore an Islamophobic, white supremacist position that incest is blackening, non-Christian, and geographically distant from England. They engage in a process that identifies nonwhite women as the primary incest victims and victimizers and implies that white Protestant readers who break this taboo would lose a racial identity they were simultaneously being taught to recognize as their innate white property.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract At the interface of grammar and nature, bees served as a figure of transgender identification for monks in England, France, and Germany circa 800–1070. Monks recognised bees as essential nonhuman participants in monastic life. Bees were associated with chastity, and communal life, but also with the arts of grammar and poetry. They were also known for their divergence from human sexual difference. Monastic writers used bees to conceptualise their own status in the sexual economy of their society, by experimenting with the grammatical genders used to refer to bees, identifying bees with monks, and rewriting the genders of monks in the process. This process of nonbeenary identification unfolds in Old English and Latin bee charms, and in the works of monastic writers including Rainerus of Blandin, Bern of Reichenau, and Wulfstan of Winchester.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper develops a counter-mapping approach to informal public performance spaces. It examines how these spaces take shape through everyday negotiations, rhythmic practices and micro-spatial tactics. The mapping techniques constitute counter-mapping because they intentionally trace patterns of use that remain absent from official zoning maps and scenic masterplans, making visible the lived routines and spatial claims of elderly rural migrants that formal representations typically overlook. These mapped rhythms also provide a basis for small design and management adjustments that move beyond the limits of static base-maps and enforcement-led zoning. The analysis draws on the concept of place ballet to interpret these mappings and examine the temporal routines, spatial rhythms and power relations embedded in public performances. Focusing on elderly rural migrants in Jinan, China, particularly within the city’s historic core and the renowned Daming Lake Park, the study uses participant observation, interviews and mapping techniques organised around five analytical lenses: timeline of events; trajectories, movements, rhythm and power; layout and spatial organisation; environmental factors; and props, imagination and cultural symbols. These analyses reveal how performance practices function both as cultural expression and as a means of fostering social connection and emotional resilience, while also uncovering the complex dynamics of everyday spatial practice.",

It forms the foundation for the overall quality of the project which translate to improved profit, market share and customer retention. However, market turbulence in Zimbabwe disrupts supplier commitments which tend to undermine the operational performance of hospitality firms. Thus, the study’s aim was to examine the influence of supplier selection on the operational performance of the firms in the hospitality industry in Zimbabwe. Data were gathered using questionnaires and semi structured interviews. Qualitative data was analysed using thematic data analysis approach. Quantitative data were collected by questionnaires and analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 27. The study established that hotels under study used single sourcing, dual sourcing, parallel sourcing, multiple sourcing and local sourcing. Local sourcing was preferred owing to logistical simplicity, avoidance of import costs, and supporting local vendors. The study found a significant relationship between sourcing practices and operational performance of the hospitality industry in Zimbabwe. Competitive bidding had positive impact on performance, and strategic supplier partnerships had also a strong influence in operational performance. The study recommends strategic partnerships, and development of local suppliers to enhance operational performance.",

    "Abstract": "Acoustic metasurface-based vortex generators have shown effective feasibility, yet they remain constrained by limited bandwidth or fixed functionality. Here, we propose a reconfigurable multilayered (RM) metasurface capable of dynamically manipulating acoustic vortices over a broadband frequency range. The RM metasurface comprises eight sector-shaped units and is placed into a circular waveguide supporting a maximum topological charge of lM = 1. Each sector-shaped unit is built upon the designed coiling structure and consists of two auxiliary layers and one functional layer with rotatable blades. Dynamic reconfiguration of the intrinsic topological charge (lξ) in RM metasurface is achieved by rotating the blades in the functional layer of each sector-shaped unit. Simulation results confirm that across the frequency range of 3.1–3.9 kHz, the tunable lξ enables the conversion of an incident acoustic plane wave into multiple acoustic vortex states. This work balances the broadband operation and tunable functionality in acoustic vortex generation, providing a promising platform for practical acoustic vortex-based applications.",

    "Abstract": "We investigate a set of design principles that link specific features of interparticle interactions to predictable structural and dynamic outcomes in two-dimensional self-assembly, a framework relevant to soft matter and biological condensates. Using extensive molecular dynamics simulations of single- and two-component systems, we systematically dissect how modifications to competing short-range attraction and long-range repulsion (SALR) potentials (both isotropic and anisotropic) serve as independent control parameters. In particular, we have focused on tuning the repulsive barrier height, decorating the attractive well with oscillatory components, and changing particle geometry. We demonstrate that these modifications dictate cluster size distributions, the degree of intra-cluster ordering, the geometry of the clusters, and the propensity for inter-cluster crystallization. A key finding is the decoupling of internal and global dynamics: oscillatory wells promote solid-like order within clusters while maintaining liquid-like cluster mobility. Furthermore, we show how asymmetric interactions in a binary SALR mixture can be designed to induce internal phase segregation within condensates. Complementing this, we observe that in anisotropic models in which the short-range component of the interaction stems from the presence of attractive patchy sites, stoichiometry and the geometric distribution of the patches are essential to control self-assembly and cluster morphology, whereas long-range repulsion can be used to tune cluster size and polydispersity. The extracted principles provide a causal road-map for engineering self-assembled materials and a set of basic physical concepts for interpreting the complex phase behavior of biomolecular condensates.",

    "Abstract": "Context. Globally, aquaculture contributes around 130 million tonnes of production to human consumption and has vital roles in food security and nutrition. Significant challenges relate to farming in suboptimum environments due, in part, to climate and environmental change. The current review concerns fed-aquaculture in Australia and it explores feeding and nutrition of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) as a key aquaculture species experiencing suboptimum environments. Aims. To outline impacts of global climate and environmental change on fed-aquaculture and its role in global and local food production; outline impacts of global climate and environmental change on the production biology and nutritional physiology of fed-aquaculture species; examine mitigation of impacts of global climate and environmental change via feeding and nutrition ; overview and assess approaches to research, existing and emerging methods, and research paradigms used to understand impacts of global climate and environmental change. Methods. Global literature was reviewed via online databases using relevant search terms. Key results. Nutritional mitigation, particularly through ensuring energy and nutrients are optimised to meet different conditions and changing nutritional regimes, appears well established as well as being under continued refinement. Challenges include developing strategies for precision nutrition and more closely matching feeding and nutrition regimes with changing and different requirements. There are also challenges and opportunities in refining the inclusion of required micro-nutrients, supplements and ensuring product quality is maintained. Knowledge gaps remain in understanding with more precision what the requirements are for feeding and nutrients across the production cycle and in different production systems. Conclusions. Successful nutritional mitigation, centred around better understanding the impacts of biotic and abiotic factors on energy and nutrient requirements, should support greater precision in formulating feeds to meet requirements across a wider range of situations including production cycle stage (size of fish), season (summer and autumn) and ingredient use (alternative protein sources). Implications. Aquaculture is essential to global food systems, but its sustainability depends on adapting to climate change, improving feeding practices, and integrating ecological and social license. Continued innovation and integration across disciplines are key to ensuring aquaculture remains a viable and responsible source of nutrition and livelihoods.",

    "Abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) is an emerging tool for wildlife biologists and citizen scientists to build local knowledge about biodiversity and detect invasive species. While single-species eDNA assays are widely used to detect cryptic species, metabarcoding approaches can simultaneously detect a wide range of taxa depending on the chosen genetic target. In a partnership pilot study between Traditional Owners, scientists, and Government, we used a 12S metabarcoding approach to identify the vertebrate prey consumed by predators in the Burragorang Valley on Gundungurra Country (NSW, Australia). Here, we report an incidental but important detection of an invasive fish species, Oriental Weatherloach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, in multiple Red Fox Vulpes vulpes scats within the high conservation value landscape of the Burragorang Valley (encompassing the WaterNSW Warragamba Special Areas). Our eDNA identification of Oriental Weatherloach was later validated by a physical capture of the species. We reviewed public databases to better understand the distribution of this invasive species in the region and discovered that Oriental Weatherloach had been detected upstream of the Warragamba Special Area on the Wollondilly and Wingecarribee Rivers, expanding its range since the 1990s. However, this was the first detection within the strictly controlled inner conservation zone for Lake Burragorang, Sydney’s drinking water supply. The recent invasion of this exotic fish species was not widely known by Traditional Owners, local community, Government departments or conservation groups and is significant as it is within the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area. Our preliminary study highlights the value of using eDNA metabarcoding on predator scats as a biomonitoring tool for the incidental detection of invasive species and shows that freshwater fish may play a more significant role in the diet of foxes than previously understood.",

    "Abstract": "Rationale: Existing data processing applications for SP-ICP-ToF-MS, while valuable, have some limitations including restricted multi-sample analysis capabilities, vendor-specific constraints and the lack of efficient visualization approaches. Researchers need flexible, interactive visualization tools that can reveal compositional patterns and enable side-by-side sample comparisons for rapid trend identification and comprehensive data exploration across large datasets. Methodology: we developed IsotopeTrack, an open-source Python-based platform designed specifically for SP-ICP-ToF-MS data processing with cross-platform compatibility (Windows and MacOS). The application implements complete calibration methodologies including transport rate and sensitivity calibrations, three distinct peak detection algorithms (Currie method, Formula C, and compound Poisson log-normal) and element specific parameter optimization. Performance was validated using diverse engineered nanoparticles including TiO₂, CeO₂, metallic alloys (Ni-Fe-Co, Ni-Fe-Cr-Mn, Ni-Fe-Mo), and Au/Ag core-shell particles. The platform features an interactive results canvas with drag and drop capabilities for constructing customized analysis pipelines and it supports multiple file formats. Results: IsotopeTrack successfully analyzed multi-element alloy compositions with a high accuracy. For Ni-Fe-Co alloys, measured mass compositions of ⁶⁰Ni (29.3%), ⁵⁷Fe (55.1%), and ⁵⁹Co (17.7%) closely matched known values of 28% Ni, 55% Fe, and 17% Co. Ultra-uniform gold nanoparticles yielded mean diameters of 52.0±5.0 nm, 29.5±4.4 nm, and 21.1±4.3 nm for nominal 50, 30, and 20 nm particles. The platform generated comprehensive visualizations including elemental correlations, isotopic ratio distributions, ternary diagrams, and composition heatmaps. Processing time was reduced from hours to minutes through parallel processing. The comparison of environmental samples consisting of hundreds of thousands of particles was greatly facilitated. Discussion: IsotopeTrack addressed critical limitations in SP-ICP-ToF-MS data analysis by providing batch processing and interactive visualization tools. Element specific optimization ensured analytical rigor, while dramatically reducing processing time. This open-source framework represents a significant advance in single particle analysis, enabling efficient processing of large datasets essential for nanoparticle characterization in complex systems.",

    "Abstract": "Current methodologies for detecting the sequence of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) require amplifying and denaturing the target into single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to enable sequence detection through Watson–Crick base pairing. However, these approaches are limited by the risks of nonspecific amplification, reliance on complex, temperature-sensitive protein enzymes, and harsh reaction conditions, such as in strong base or acidic environments. Here, we introduce a dsDNA detection platform that integrates a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) as the dsDNA denaturation agent, with multicomponent deoxyribozyme as the ssDNA detection tool, in a droplet-based system. This protein- and amplification-free method offers single-nucleotide resolution, detects down to a single dsDNA molecule, and delivers results within 1 h at room temperature. This work introduces a conceptually unique approach, that may be useful for both diagnostics and therapeutics.",

    "Abstract": "Microalgae induce a CO 2 -concentrating mechanism (CCM) to maintain photosynthesis when CO 2 is limited. Because this system consumes a substantial portion of photosynthetically generated ATP, its suppression when CO 2 levels rise is critical for energy balance, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we identify a nuclear repressor of the CCM in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii . A pull-down screen for interacting partners of the master activator CCM1/CIA5 revealed an uncharacterized protein that tightly associates with CCM1. This protein, CCM1-binding protein 1 (CBP1), combines a CobW/CobW_C GTP-binding metallochaperone module with a WW-domain characteristic of protein–protein interactions. CBP1 colocalizes and interacts with CCM1 in the nucleus regardless of CO 2 conditions. Disruption of CBP1 does not affect growth or CCM induction under CO 2 limitation but derepresses 27 of 41 CCM1-dependent low-CO 2 inducible genes under high-CO 2 conditions. These include the periplasmic and intracellular carbonic anhydrases (CAH1 and LCIB) and inorganic carbon transporters/channels (LCIA, LCI1, BST1, and BST3). Consistently, cbp1 mutants accumulate CAH1 and LCIB proteins and exhibit 40% higher inorganic carbon affinity under high-CO 2 conditions; this phenotype is rescued by CBP1 complementation or by acetazolamide treatment. Crucially, cbp1 mutants exhibit significant growth delays under high-CO 2 conditions, especially when light is limiting, providing direct evidence that CBP1-mediated repression is essential for energy conservation. Thus, CBP1 prevents unnecessary CCM activity when CO 2 is abundant, acting upstream of both transporter/channel and carbonic anhydrase modules. Our findings suggest a regulatory mechanism potentially linking zinc-dependent protein chemistry to CCM gene repression, providing insights into energy-efficient CO 2 sensing in aquatic photosynthetic organisms.",

    "Abstract": "Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM), a thermoresponsive homopolymer, is a well-established model for investigating coil-to-globule transitions. Here, we combine long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, data sonification, and graph-theory analysis to elucidate the roles of intramolecular and PNIPAM–solvent hydrogen-bond (H-bond) patterns in the PNIPAM globule–coil equilibrium. Our analysis separates the driving forces for compaction into two contributions: the entropic gain from the loss of hydration water around hydrophobic patches and the enthalpic stabilization from water H-bonded to PNIPAM. We find that the role of the solvent in polymer compaction is more active and complex than has been previously assumed. Our observations indicate that direct, intrachain hydrogen bonds between amide groups (N–H···O=C) are not the primary stabilizing force. Instead, the collapsed globule contains an N–H···N network of local side-chain interactions and is stabilized by a dynamic network of persistent, long-distance water bridges, where individual water molecules form hydrogen bonds with multiple parts of the polymer chain.",

    "Abstract": "Behavioral research has been criticized for relying on demographically narrow WEIRD samples-Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic. While recent work has expanded to explore cross-country behavioral differences, the study of within-country variation has largely focused on gender, ignoring race and ethnicity—so much so that the “W” in WEIRD might as well stand for “White.” Using incentivized tasks and a large, stratified sample of U.S. adults, we document substantial racial and ethnic gaps in competitiveness and risk tolerance both of which are widely studied behavioral measures: (non-Hispanic) Whites are less competitive and more risk tolerant than Blacks and Hispanics. These gaps are comparable in magnitude to the corresponding gender gaps in our sample. Notably, gender differences do not generalize across racial and ethnic groups: Whereas Whites and Hispanics exhibit gender gaps in competitiveness and risk tolerance, Black women neither shy away from competition nor are they less risk tolerant than Black men. These findings challenge prevailing generalizations in the literature and underscore the importance of examining race and ethnicity in behavioral research.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background : Fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda , is a detrimental pest in maize production, and its infestation is driven by manifold climate factors. Mapping FAW infestation occurrence for climate scenarios is useful for risk management planning. Methods : We utilised public and private FAW observations and extracted various remotely sensed climate data sets as candidate predictors. A maximum extropy algorithm was used to model the probability of FAW presence in Kenya with varied input choices, and the best performance model was selected for future prediction based on performance matrics and existing biological knowledge of the importance of climate factors on FAW prevalence. Results : Our results show that the choice of null hypothesis of FAW distribution (under no climate influence), depicted as background samples, strongly influences the model output. Precipitation, vapour pressure, and temperature were all important for model predictive ability, though to varying degrees depending on the specific climatic data sources. Using combined predictions from the three best models (with an average area under receiver-operating curve of 0.86 and sensitivity of 0.77), we found that only 10.6%of areas in Kenya had current FAW presence probability more than 0.4 (i.e. moderate to high FAW suitability). Most of these areas are in high-maize yielding agroecological zones for Kenya (moist mid-altitude zone e.g. Busia, Bungoma, Siaya), and some are in top maize producer (highland and moist transitional areas e.g. Trans Nzoia). A total of 2.7–3.5% of Kenya will experience an increased probability of FAW attack by 2040, including the areas with the highest maize yield (e.g. Uasin Gishu, Nakuru), in both mild and extreme projected socio-economic pathways. Conclusion : Therefore, intensive surveillance for early detection or adopting more FAW-resistant maize cultivars in these high FAW probability areas is likely to greatly benefit and de-risk the national maize economy and food security in Kenya.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Climate agro-advisory services (CAS) have emerged as critical tools for climate adaptation and risk management within Africa’s rapidly evolving agri-food systems. Yet, empirical evidence on CAS impacts remains limited. This study conducts a systematic review of 54 peer-reviewed articles, 12 of which explicitly consider gender dimensions, to examine CAS types, utilization, and their impacts on agricultural decision-making and resilience. This article categorizes key CAS modalities and evaluates their effectiveness across varied agroecological and institutional contexts. Findings reveal that while forecasts are widely disseminated, access to early warning systems, agrometeorological services, digital climate advisories, and localized climate information remains uneven. Gender disparities persist in access patterns, preferred dissemination channels, usage behaviors, and livelihood impacts. Digital advisories disproportionately favor men, whereas radio and community-based dissemination remain the most inclusive platforms for women and marginalized groups. CAS have shown positive effects on farmers’ decision making, adoption of climate-smart technologies, productivity, and adaptive capacity. However, their full potential is constrained by fragmented delivery mechanisms, weak coordination between climate and agricultural institutions, persistent inequalities, and limited contextualization of climate data. Advancing equity requires addressing structural gender barriers and tailoring CAS to farmers’ diverse roles, priorities, and resource constraints. Strengthening institutional coordination, promoting multi-channel communication through digital innovation, and embedding CAS within national climate and agricultural resilience frameworks are essential steps toward building inclusive, adaptive, and sustainable agricultural systems across Africa.",

    "Abstract": "Poor dietary diversity (DD) in pregnancy can lead to nutritional deficiencies, resulting in poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. This cross-sectional study assessed the DD of 681 pregnant women in a tertiary hospital in South Africa. DD, household food insecurity and sociodemographic status were assessed using the MDD-W indicator, HFIAS and a questionnaire. 99.4% of participants consumed starchy staples, while only 7.9%, 10.6% and 13.5% consumed pulses; nuts and seeds; and dark green leafy vegetables, respectively. Only 32.9% achieved the MDD-W. Unemployment, having only primary education, severe food insecurity, as well as monthly income of 100-1000 ZAR and 1001-3000 ZAR were associated with 69% (<i>p</i> < .001), 72% (<i>p</i> = .010), 43% (<i>p</i> = .024), 82% (<i>p</i> < .001) and 50% (<i>p</i> = .003) decreased odds of achieving MDD-W, respectively. The findings indicate low DD and likely micronutrient inadequacy among this population of pregnant women. Lower monthly income, lower educational level, unemployment and severe household food insecurity were associated with inadequate DD. Addressing structural barriers, including poverty, unemployment, and food insecurity, is essential to support a more diverse diet during pregnancy.",

    "Abstract": "Existing research on vaccination communication has emphasized commercial marketing and social mobilization, while culturally attuned approaches remain underexplored. This study examines how the Chinese state moralizes vaccine promotion on social media in emergencies. Using content analysis of 205 government-produced videos and 58 stakeholder interviews, we find that state actors frame vaccination as a civilizational practice that merges Confucian ethics with biomedical rationales. Simultaneously, they harness entertainment affordances that intertwine playful performance, ritualization, and interactivity to amplify affective resonance and foster participatory engagement. This dual strategy reframes vaccination from a solely obligatory act into a socially meaningful, even enjoyable, act. However, we also identify a critical caveat: when moral appeals become excessive, they may reduce message receptivity. Our findings suggest that effective vaccine communication should bound moralization. Specifically, communication can be more effective by focusing on key ethical messages, using supportive, dialogue-oriented tones, and connecting moral narratives with practical guidance. We introduce a bounded moralization framework that reconciles collectivist and individualist orientations, balances entertainment with epistemic authority, and optimizes the communication dynamics between state and society. Practically, this framework offers guidance for designing culturally grounded health campaigns that are both persuasive and respectful of public needs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Fine root anatomy directly affects drought resistance through water transport efficiency and storage capacity, while its variation may be phylogenetically constrained, reflecting evolutionary selection of drought adaptation strategies. While fine roots exhibit remarkable functional plasticity, the phylogenetic imprint on their anatomical trait variation patterns remains unclear, highlighting a critical knowledge gap in plant adaptation strategies. Methods This study investigated 21 local tree species from northern subtropical China to quantify anatomical traits across first- to fifth-order fine roots. By integrating drought resistance assessments with phylogenetic signal analysis (K - value), we investigated how plant species, root order, and their interactions drive functional differentiation in fine roots. Our findings elucidate adaptive strategies in absorption-transport trade-offs while delineating phylogenetic constraints on trait variation. Key results Our results demonstrate: (1) Species and root order jointly drive adaptive differentiation in fine root anatomy, where root diameter, cortex ratio, vessel diameter, and root cross-sectional area emerge as key drought-resistance traits; (2) PCA revealed cortex traits dominate water absorption (PC1), while vessel traits (vessel density and stele ratio) govern transport capacity (PC2); (3) Phylogenetic analyses showed strong conservatism in first- to fourth-order roots, with evolutionary history accounting for significant trait variation, underscoring phylogenetic constraints on functional adaptation. This study deciphers the dual regulatory framework of fine root anatomical adaptation to drought stress, integrating eco-physiological trait networks with phylogenetic constraint analysis. Conclusions These findings not only amplify the fundamental understanding of evolutionary trade-offs in plant hydraulic strategies, but also establish a mechanistic basis for precision selection of afforestation species.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background and Aims As the stigma of female flower in maize, silks emerge sequentially from ear base to apex, potentially causing barren ear tip. This study aimed to reveal the underlying regulatory mechanisms in coordinating the elongation of a cohort of silks on an ear. Methods Morphological, physiological, metabolic and transcriptional investigations were performed on silks from basal, middle and apical regions of an ear at the initial (T1), rapid elongation (T2), and silking stages (T3), respectively. Key Results Silk extension rate and length progressively declined from ear base to apex, correlated with decreased hexose availability due to lower sucrose supply and weaker sucrose decomposition, as well as the gradient phytohormone deposition. Further comparative analyses on silk metabolomics and transcriptomics between three stages and three positions identified the stage-specific and position-specific genes and metabolites. The elongation of silks at three positions involves the common pathways including sugar and amino acid depletion, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, and phytohormone responses. Stage-specific pathways indicated that nucleic acid metabolism was predominant at T1, carbohydrate and energy metabolism at T2, and defense metabolism at T3. Position-specific pathways highlighted the earlier biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in basal silks, and delayed phytohormone signaling, starch and sucrose metabolism, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in apical silks. At T3, silk senescence progressed from ear base to apex by having more severe sugar depletion, salicylic/jasmonic acids deposition, and active brassinosteroid/abscisic acid synthesis. Conclusions The sequential silk elongation on an ear is collectively coordinated by assimilates competition, phytohormone signals, and secondary metabolism, providing foundations for crop improvement in combating barren ear tip.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Dual-plane breast augmentation has traditionally been the standard approach in aesthetic breast surgery, while prepectoral placement was reserved for selected anatomical indications. Advances in implant technology and growing clinical experience have led to a renewed reassessment of these beliefs. Objectives To describe a shift in clinical practice from predominantly dual-plane to more frequent prepectoral breast augmentation, supported by years of retrospective data and qualitative clinical insight. Methods We reviewed all primary breast augmentations performed over a four-year period (2021–2024) and compared these data with cases performed by the same author between 2009 and 2020. The analysis focused on the rationale for plane selection, patient characteristics, and implant volume. The discussion integrates reflections from an experienced plastic surgeon with more than 2,000 augmentations. Results Subglandular placement increased substantially over time. It accounted for only 3.25% of augmentations performed between 2009 and 2020, rising to 21.7% in 2021–2022 and reaching 42.2% in 2023–2024. This progressive shift reflects growing clinical confidence in the technique and increasing patient preference. Conclusions Implant plane selection should be individualised. The increased use of prepectoral augmentation reflects a shift in surgical strategy driven by anatomy, patient activity level, and aesthetic objectives. When appropriately indicated, avoiding muscle manipulation can yield favourable and reliable outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Blue copper proteins are a well-studied group of metalloproteins characterized by a type 1 copper site. The properties of the active site are influenced by the primary coordination sphere and the second coordination sphere. In this study, we investigated the effects of Met16Gly and Met16Ala variants of pseudoazurin, which were designed to remove S-π noncovalent interaction with a Cu-coordinating His81. Both variants were spectroscopically similar to the wild type (WT), indicating minimal changes in the electronic structure of the active site. However, the redox potential of Met16Gly was ca. 50 mV and 40 mV higher than WT and Met16Ala, respectively. The stability of the variants followed the order WT &amp;gt; Met16Ala &amp;gt; Met16Gly, as determined by electrospray-mass spectrometry. X-ray crystal structure analyses revealed that the Met16Gly adopts both \"close\" and \"open\" conformations of the “side-loop”, while Met16Ala and WT only shows a close conformation. The open conformation in Met16Gly exposes the Cu-coordinating His81 to the solvent, likely facilitating copper ion dissociation and protein unfolding. The positive shift of redox potential can be rationalized in terms of the entatic state or rack-induced bonding model, in which increased side-loop flexibility relaxes the protein-imposed constraints on the Cu-coordination.",

All-cause mortality, SAS (re-) operation, and cardiovascular events, including arrhythmias, heart failure, (re-)operation for aortic regurgitation (AR), were assessed. Longitudinal changes in echocardiographic peak velocity, interventricular septal thickness (IVST), and left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW) were analysed using linear mixed-effects models. Differences in the history of SAS repair (operated/unoperated patients), isolated/non-isolated SAS, and sex were explored. Results Overall, 312 patients were included [age: 26.0 (interquartile range, IQR: 20.0–35.3) years, 68.3% history of SAS repair] with a median follow-up of 16 (IQR: 10–20) years (4423 patient-years). Unadjusted survival at 15 years was lower in the operated group compared to the unoperated group (P = .009) and no significant differences were observed between sexes (P = .083) or isolated/non-isolated SAS (P = .810). The cumulative incidence of (re-)operation for AR at 15 years was 7.6% (95% CI 4.7%–11.0%). The hazard of SAS repair during follow-up was higher in the unoperated group compared to the operated group [HR 0.2 (95% CI 0.1–0.5), P &amp;lt; .001], after correction for covariates. Peak velocity progression was 0.1 m/s (P = .357) during the first period and 0.3 m/s (P = .032) during the second (after ±10 years). No patient showed fast progression (≥0.3 m/s/year) in peak velocity. At baseline no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy was observed, following IVST/LVPW criteria. Conclusions Survival of adult SAS patients with a history of SAS repair was substantially lower compared to the unoperated group, reflecting a potentially more severe SAS phenotype. Nevertheless, long-term clinical event rates were considerable. SAS remained stable, suggesting less echocardiographic follow-up may suffice, particularly in mild phenotypes without AR. Additionally, follow-up should focus on the clinical sequelae of SAS.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria has severely compromised the efficacy of conventional antibiotics and intensified the global antimicrobial resistance crisis. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have attracted considerable interest as adjunctive agents due to their membrane-active mechanisms and immunomodulatory properties; however, their clinical use as monotherapy remains limited by instability, toxicity, and pharmacokinetic constraints. Combining AMPs with conventional antibiotics has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance antibacterial efficacy, restore antibiotic susceptibility, and modulate resistance development. This review critically examines the mechanistic basis of AMP–antibiotic synergy, integrating evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies. Particular emphasis is placed on determinants that govern synergistic outcomes, including membrane permeability, porin-dependent antibiotic uptake, resistance-associated adaptations, and host-related factors that cannot be captured in vitro. In addition, we discuss key translational barriers limiting clinical implementation, such as immune modulation, pharmacokinetic mismatch, peptide instability, and strain-dependent variability in synergistic responses. By linking molecular mechanisms to experimental and translational outcomes, this review provides a focused framework for rational design and optimization of AMP–antibiotic combination therapies against MDR bacterial infections.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Starmerella clade is known for displaying osmotolerant and acidophilic traits from their association with bees. Several species in this genus can produce sophorolipids, which are commercially produced as biosurfactants. Here, we isolated a yeast contaminant from the laboratory environment, identified as Starmerella batistae, able to thrive at low pH and relative high temperatures. We sequenced and conducted a de novo genome assembly in three chromosomes and a mitochondrial genome for S. batistae (ca. 9.3 Mb). Based on this reference genome we functionally annotated 29 Starmerella species, using the publicly available sequences. Phylogenetic analysis across different yeast clades revealed a close relationship between Starmerella and Schizosaccharomyces yeasts. Fifteen genes were uniquely shared between Sz. pombe and S. batistae, of which twelve were involved in cell morphology, reflecting the fact that S. batistae cells are elongated rather than round. We found that all the Starmerella sophorolipid-producing strains shared a close common ancestor. One-to-one orthologs of S. bombicola sophorolipid pathway were only found in S. kuoi (full pathway, but inverted), and in S. powellii and S. floricola (partial pathway). These findings support the notion that alternative pathways for the production of sophorolipids have evolved in different Starmerella lineages.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Castilleja lassenensis, a species of root-parasitic plants endemic to the Mt. Lassen region in northern California, has been subject to taxonomic debate since its first description in 1940. While morphological and ecological distinctions from its close relative C. lemmonii have been documented, many regional floras do not list C. lassenensis or treat it as a synonym of C. lemmonii. We sequenced the nuclear genomes of C. lassenensis and C. lemmonii and performed comparative genomic analyses including gene content, functional enrichment, and phylogenetic placement. The genome of C. lassenensis, although slightly smaller than that of C. lemmonii, shows higher gene content, with different patterns of gene duplication. Functional genomic analysis revealed distinct enrichment patterns in the two species, with metabolic and transport functions enriched in C. lassenensis versus cellular organization in C. lemmonii. The taxa also show divergence in peptidase and CAZyme distributions, as well as in KAI2d proteins involved in strigolactone perception. Population-level validation using diagnostic PCR markers across multiple individuals from geographically separate populations confirmed stable genomic differences. Our results support the recognition of C. lassenensis as a distinct species underscore the need for measures to ensure its conservation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The cuticle is a hydrophobic barrier limiting water loss and pathogen entry. Although light influences cuticle formation, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, particularly in fruits. Here, we show that fruits from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants grown under far-red-enriched light conditions displayed increased cuticle load due to the up-regulation of cutin and wax biosynthetic genes. Both tomato PHYB-encoding genes (SlPHYB1 and SlPHYB2) were implicated as negative regulators of fruit cuticle formation, as revealed by the thinner cuticles, reduced abundance of cutin monomers and cuticular waxes, and downregulation of cuticle-related genes detected in fruits from transgenic plants overexpressing constitutively active alleles of SlPHYB1/B2 (SlYHB1OE and SlYHB2OE). The impaired cuticle of SlYHB1/B2OE fruits resulted in increased susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea, despite their markedly enhanced flavonoid accumulation in the peel. PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (SlPIF3, SlPIF4) and the B-box protein SlBBX28 were identified as downstream factors of SlPHYB1/B2-mediated regulation of cuticle deposition, synergistically activating the expression of cuticle-related genes. Additionally, SlPHYB1/B2 signaling also downregulated multiple central carbon metabolism-related genes in the fruit peel, likely reducing the pool of activated fatty acids (FAs) feeding into cutin and wax biosynthetic pathways. Together, our results uncover a novel regulatory layer of light signaling in fleshy fruits, revealing that, besides controlling fruit nutritional traits, the PHYB-PIF-BBX regulatory module also shapes the fruit cuticle formation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We develop a new and powerful method to analyze time series to rigorously detect flares in the presence of an irregularly oscillatory baseline, and apply it to stellar light curves observed with TESS. First, we remove the underlying non-stochastic trend using a time-varying amplitude harmonic model. We then model the stochastic component of the light curves in a manner analogous to financial time series, as an ARMA+GARCH process, allowing us to detect and characterize impulsive flares as large deviations inconsistent with the correlation structure in the light curve. We apply the method to exemplar light curves from TIC 13955147 (a G5V eruptive variable), TIC 269797536 (an M4 high-proper motion star), and TIC 441420236 (AU Mic, an active dMe flare star), detecting up to 145, 460, and 403 flares respectively, at rates ranging from ≈0.4 − 8.5 day−1 over different sectors and under different detection thresholds. We detect flares down to amplitudes of 0.03%, 0.29%, and 0.007% of the bolometric luminosity for each star respectively. We model the distributions of flare energies and peak fluxes as power-laws, and find that the solar-like star exhibits values similar to that on the Sun (αE, P ≈ 1.85, 2.36), while for the less- and highly-active low-mass stars αE, P &amp;gt; 2 and &amp;lt;2 respectively.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We present a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach for solving the classical 2-level atom non-LTE radiative transfer problem by framing it as a control task in which an RL agent learns a depth-dependent source function S(τ) that self-consistently satisfies the equation of statistical equilibrium (SE). The agent’s policy is optimized entirely via reward-based interactions with a radiative transfer engine, without explicit knowledge of the ground truth. This method bypasses the need for constructing approximate lambda operators (Λ*) common in accelerated iterative schemes. Additionally, it requires no extensive precomputed labeled datasets to extract a supervisory signal, and avoids backpropagating gradients through the complex RT solver itself. Finally, we show through experiment that a simple feedforward neural network trained greedily cannot solve for SE, possibly due to the moving target nature of the problem. Our Λ* − Free method offers potential advantages for complex scenarios (e.g., atmospheres with enhanced velocity fields, multi-dimensional geometries, or complex microphysics) where Λ* construction or solver differentiability is challenging. Additionally, the agent can be incentivized to find more efficient policies by manipulating the discount factor, leading to a reprioritization of immediate rewards. If demonstrated to generalize past its training data, this RL framework could serve as an alternative or accelerated formalism to achieve SE. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first application of reinforcement learning in solar physics that directly solves for a fundamental physical constraint.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The weaponization of smell has sparked a growing interest in the studies of warfare, policing, and the senses. This paper examines one peculiar mode of olfactory weaponization, Skunk Water, an Israeli-invented policing technology developed to pacify protests with a nauseating and sticky smell. By highlighting connections between material, affective, and political dimensions of Skunk Water policing, the paper argues more attention should be paid to spatial dynamics of racial violence, particular as they manifest through producing olfactory environments, or what we call stench atmospheres. Specifically, the paper unpacks two interrelated aspects of stench atmospheres: first, how Skunk Water policing produces affective atmospheres by materially marking, disrupting, terrorizing, and humiliating—or “enveloping”—racialized and segregated Palestinian communities, and second, how these affective-material atmospheres, along with the “deodorization” logics they entail, transform when they boomerang from the occupied Palestinian territory back inside Israel. The paper thus offers nuanced insights regarding contemporary (colonial) policing techniques and their circulation, particularly the spatiotemporal modalities of (in)security that work by engulfing racialized communities in stench atmospheres and the underlying logics of atmospheric contamination and deodorization they enact.",

    "Abstract": "Pediatric heart failure is a heterogeneous, high-risk clinical syndrome that differs fundamentally from adult heart failure in its etiologies, pathophysiology, and therapeutic responses. Although its absolute prevalence is lower, children experience disproportionate morbidity and mortality, with up to 40% of patients with symptomatic cardiomyopathy progressing to death or transplantation within 2 years of diagnosis. Congenital heart disease, cardiomyopathies, and genetic or metabolic disorders dominate the etiologic spectrum, while developmental differences in myocardial signaling, neurohormonal activation, and ventricular remodeling limit direct extrapolation of adult guideline-directed medical therapy. Evidence supporting pharmacologic treatment remains limited, and most therapies are symptom-modifying rather than outcome-modifying, particularly in single-ventricle physiology. Advances in mechanical circulatory support and heart transplantation have substantially improved survival, yet pose unique anatomic, physiological, and ethical challenges in children. This review synthesizes contemporary evidence across medical, device-based, and transplant therapies, highlights lesion- and age-specific considerations, and identifies critical research gaps needed to advance outcomes in pediatric heart failure.",

We seek to assess demographic and geographic disparities and examine mortality trends from CAD and COPD in the United States from 1999 to 2023. We retrieved mortality data for patients with CAD and COPD from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research Multiple Cause of Death database from 1999 to 2023. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) per 100,000 population were calculated, and trends were analyzed using the Joinpoint regression model to estimate the annual percent change (APC) in AAMR. Mortality data were stratified by age, sex, race/ethnicity, urbanization, and Census regions. A total of 1,471,054 mortalities showed the existence of CAD and COPD on death certification. The AAMR decreased from 61.1 to 41.8 from 1999 to 2023. The AAMR declined sharply until 2018 (APC −1.9), followed by a significant incline till 2021 (APC 4), after which it continued to decrease significantly until 2023 (APC −6.12). AAMR was twofold greater in males (71.7) than in females (34.3). Among races/ethnicities, non-Hispanic Whites (52.7) had the top AAMR. Mortality rates were 13 times greater among older adults than among middle-aged adults. From geographics, nonmetropolitan areas (63.3) and the Midwest region (55.2) had the highest AAMRs. These disparities across demographic and geographical variables necessitate appropriate resource allocation and targeted interventions to reduce the CAD–COPD mortality burden.",

    "Abstract": "Guidelines and much of the literature favor bioprosthetic heart valves in women with pregnancy desire, yet most evidence is restricted to pregnancy and the first decade after surgery, a period when bioprostheses are usually functionally intact, and late structural valve degeneration and reintervention are underrepresented. This review synthesizes data across the life course and examines how time-window bias may magnify early advantages of bioprostheses while obscuring long-term tradeoffs. Evidence suggests that bioprostheses often yield better fetal outcomes and fewer anticoagulation-related complications around pregnancy, whereas beyond 10–15 years, cumulative risks of degeneration, valve-in-valve limitations, and prosthesis–patient mismatch may erode these early benefits. In carefully selected patients, particularly in higher-risk positions such as the mitral valve, mechanical valves can provide superior long-term durability when high-quality anticoagulation and multidisciplinary pregnancy planning are feasible. Individualized decision-making should integrate valve position, anticoagulation capacity, pregnancy timing, patient preferences, and health system resources. Future studies should extend follow-up beyond 15 years, apply standardized definitions of structural degeneration, use competing-risk and modern causal methods, and incorporate decision-analytic modeling to quantify lifetime tradeoffs and support shared decisions.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of the Ginseng and Rhubarb Combination (GRC) on sepsis-induced persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS). Methods: The mouse model of sepsis-induced PICS was established using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Mice were randomly assigned to five groups: Sham, Model, Model + GRC, Model + GRC + oleic acid (OA), and Model + GRC + celastrol (CELA). GRC was administered by oral gavage once daily for seven days, whereas the agonists were injected intraperitoneally for three days. Additionally, KN-93 (a CaMKII inhibitor; 5 mg/kg) was used to verify the inhibitory regulation of CaMKII signaling. Seventy-two hours after surgery, serum and tissue samples were collected to evaluate the therapeutic effects of GRC. Outcome measures included survival, body weight, splenic immune cell distribution, histopathology, inflammatory cytokine levels, and ferroptosis-related indicators. Targeted metabolomics and differential proteomic analysis (DIA) based proteomics were performed to identify differential molecules and pathways associated with GRC treatment. Results: Compared to the model group, GRC markedly improved the survival rate and mitigated body weight loss in septic PICS mice. GRC reduced splenic neutrophil and macrophage infiltration and increased the proportions of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells. Histopathological examination revealed attenuation of organ damage. Levels of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-13) were significantly decreased, and metabolic disturbances were ameliorated. Biochemical assays showed that GRC reduced Fe²⁺ and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels while increasing glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and GPX4, indicating inhibition of ferroptosis. Western blot (WB) analysis demonstrated that GRC downregulated the CaMKII/HO-1 pathway, and this regulatory effect was reversed by CaMKII and HO-1 agonists. Multi-omics analysis further revealed that GRC modulated metabolic and proteomic networks associated with immune regulation and ferroptosis, confirming that its therapeutic benefits were mediated through suppression of the CaMKII/HO-1/GPX4 axis. Conclusions: GRC exhibited significant anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and organ-protective effects in the murine model of sepsis-induced PICS. These benefits were mediated through the suppression of ferroptosis via modulation of the CaMKII/HO-1 pathway, providing a novel experimental foundation and a potential therapeutic strategy for managing sepsis-associated PICS.",

This study aimed to compare the epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of rhinovirus infections and coinfections in 2 consecutive periods to identify shifts in age distribution, symptom patterns, healthcare utilization and pathogen codetection among pediatric patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted at a tertiary pediatric center and included all children aged 0–18 years with laboratory-confirmed rhinovirus infection between December 2023 and October 2025. Two consecutive 11-month periods were compared: December 2023–October 2024 (Period 1) and December 2024–October 2025 (Period 2). Demographic and laboratory parameters were recorded. Results: A total of 572 children with rhinovirus-positive samples were evaluated. The number of cases increased 2.9-fold in December 2024–October 2025 (Period 2) (from 141 to 431; 0.42 vs. 1.22 cases/day), while age and sex distributions remained similar. Children under 6 years represented the most detections, and the proportions of 0–2-year-old children were similar in both periods. Fever, cough and rhinorrhea were significantly less frequent in Period 2. Chest X-ray use increased overall (34.8%–49.7%) but remained unchanged among hospitalized patients. Hospitalization rates were comparable, and antibiotic use declined (60.0%–48.9%). Multivariable analysis showed that neither hospitalization nor antibiotic exposure predicted period assignment. Coinfections increased from 3.5% to 10.2%, though severe outcomes remained rare. Conclusions: Human rhinovirus cases nearly tripled across 2 seasons, yet clinical severity did not increase. Fever, cough and rhinorrhea declined, antibiotic use decreased and hospitalization remained stable. Coinfections became more frequent but did not affect outcomes. These observations suggest that rhinovirus circulation is expanding with a shift toward milder, community-managed illness.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To determine population values of femoroacetabular translation using dynamic hip ultrasonography (DHUS) in professional ballet dancers. Design: Cross-sectional cohort. Setting: Three ballet companies. Participants: Ninety professional ballet dancers. Interventions: Dynamic hip ultrasonography was performed (12 images/dancer, 1080 images). Biometrics included Trochanteric Prominence Angle Test and Beighton Score. Main Outcome Measures: Anterior and posterior DHUS measures were documented, and femoroacetabular translation was calculated. Results: Anterior exam mean values for female dancers in neutral (N), neutral flexed (NF), and extension external rotation (EER) positions were 4.3 ± 2.05, 9.4 ± 2.61, and 11.4 ± 2.83, respectively, and anterior translation 2.1 ± 2.08; for posterior exam, posterior neutral, posterior flexion adduction internal rotation, and posterior stand positions showed a median value (interquartile range [IQR]) 0 (0-2) and mean values of 11.7 ± 4.89 and 8.8 ± 4.63, respectively, and posterior femoroacetabular translation 10.4 ± 4.62. Ultrasound measures for male dancers' anterior exam showed 5.5 ± 2.86, 10.9 ± 2.82, and 12.9 ± 2.78 and anterior translation 1.9 ± 1.62, and posterior exam measures showed median (IQR) 0 (0-3) and mean 11.3 ± 4.69 and 10.1 ± 5.36 and posterior femoroacetabular translation 9.6 ± 3.82. Differences by sex were found in N and NF positions: male dancers had greater translation versus female dancers in the left ( P = 0.03 and P = 0.03, respectively) and right hips ( P = 0.02 and P = 0.004, respectively). Males had greater EER in the right hip compared with females ( P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: Dynamic hip ultrasonography determined population values in professional ballet dancers. Sex-based differences among dancers were found.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: This case series describes five patients with persistent shoulder pain and dysfunction consistent with Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration. All the patients here had a distinct sonographic pattern of multiple punctate hyperechoic foci within the rotator cuff (RC) tendons. These abnormal foci were confirmed to be a pain generator using an ultrasound-guided diagnostic anesthetic injections, and each patient underwent a successful tenotomy, vacuum aspiration, and debridement of these lesions. Ultrasound findings of vaccine-induced reactive changes within the RC have not been previously reported, and the sonographic findings presented in this case series are distinct from the findings traditionally seen in degenerative tendinopathy or acute RC tears. Identification of this pattern and confirmatory anesthetic injection may aid in the diagnosis of Shoulder Injury Related to Vaccine Administration and guide minimally invasive treatments in chronic cases unresponsive to conservative management.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Liver transplantation (LT) for unresectable colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) has regained interest after the TransMet trial, which reported 5-year survival exceeding 70%. However, estimates of transplant benefit (TB) are lacking. This study provides a first external validity assessment of the TransMet criteria and estimates the 5-year TB using a real-world international cohort. Methods: A retrospective multicenter study included 61 TransMet-eligible patients with unresectable CRLM who underwent LT between 2006 and 2020 across seven centers. Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs) were used to improve comparability, with sensitivity analyses on effective sample size (ESS). Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and restricted mean survival time (RMST) up to 5 years. Weighted multivariable Cox regressions were employed to assess prognostic factors after transplantation. Results: The 5-year RMST was identical in the weighted cohort (ESS=19) and the TransMet LT arm (51.0 mo). Sensitivity analysis yielded 5-year RMST consistent with residual imbalance (48.2 mo, ESS=35). KRAS mutation (HR 5.90, 95%CI:1.89–18.4), right-sided primary tumor (HR 4.17, 95%CI:1.40–12.4), and female sex (HR 5.73, 95%CI:1.04–31.6) were associated with poorer survival; CEA&gt;=80 ng/mL emerged as a potential prognostic factor (HR 6.3, 95%CI:1.73–22.6) across alternative specifications. The estimated 5-year TB of LT versus chemotherapy was 22.5 months (95% CI:15.5–29.6). Conclusion: The findings of this first real-world assessment of the TransMet trial criteria and 5-year TB estimation in unresectable CRLM point to reasonable prognostic candidates and support evaluating the inclusion of CRLM in LT allocation models. We advocate expanded multicenter data to reach sufficient prognostic stratification through well-calibrated, highly discriminative studies.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: Cochlear implant (CI) non-use and minimal-use are important, but sparsely investigated parameters. This study investigates the risk of becoming a CI non-user or a minimal-user in a post-lingual deafness adult population. Study design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Tertiary medical institution. Materials and methods: All adult patients (18 years or above) who received CI surgery at a single center from 2010 to 2022 (n=599) were invited to participate in a questionnaire study concerning the CI usage after surgery. The questionnaire information was combined with data from medical records. Non-use was defined as never/rarely usage of the device. Minimal-users were patients who reported &lt;4 hours of daily use, and patients considering ceasing to use their device, and not included in the non-use group. Results: In total, 472 (78.8%) patients replied to the questionnaire regarding CI usage. Hereof, 20 patients (4.2%) were non-users and 26 patients (5.5%) were minimal-users with mean follow-up times of 8.4±3.4 years. Rehabilitation was provided for 97% of the participants by a speech-language pathologist for 6 to 12 months. Abnormal cochlear anatomy was associated with CI non-use (odds ratio=5.7, 95% confidence interval [1.1-30.8], P =0.04). No additional correlations were found between non-users, minimal-users, and CI users. Conclusion: The CI non-user rate was 4.2% and these patients experienced lower QoL compared with CI users. In addition, 5.5% of the patients were minimal-users. In adults with abnormal cochlear anatomy, an increased risk of non-use was identified, reflecting the need for thorough information regarding surgical outcomes in this specific subgroup of patients.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: To investigate changes in hearing sensitivity post cochlear implantation with MED-EL and Advanced Bionics (AB) lateral wall electrode arrays, with a focus on characterizing delayed onset hearing loss (doHL) and concurrent electrode impedance changes. Methods: A retrospective review of 96 adult cochlear implant (CI) recipients (101 ears; MED-EL: 51, AB: 50). Hearing sensitivity was assessed using the low-frequency pure tone average (LFPTA; 125, 250, 500 Hz). Immediate decrements in hearing sensitivity were considered separately from delayed decrements. The incidence, degree, and timing of doHL were characterized. Electrode impedances were considered for individuals with doHL compared with those with stable hearing. Results: Median immediate hearing loss was 19 dB across manufacturers. At initial activation, 73% of subjects had functional (LFPTA &lt;80 dB HL) hearing. When all subjects with variable postoperative time periods were included, the incidence of doHL was 27% with a median degree of 24 dB. The median time doHL occurred was 76 weeks. Most (79%) subjects were categorized with gradual decrements rather than precipitous. No MED-EL subjects with doHL experienced concurrent impedance changes; 3 AB subjects did. Incidence of doHL rose to 31% and 44% when considering the subset of subjects with at least 1 year and 2 years of postoperative follow-up, respectively. Conclusion: DoHL that was precipitous in nature was observed less frequently than previously reported. Although precipitous hearing loss tended to occur shortly after surgery, most instances of doHL occurred later than anticipated. The absence of concurrent impedance changes for recipients of MED-EL electrode arrays is consistent with previous reports.",

    "Abstract": "Background: It is unknown whether the stress of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a particular impact on inpatient and long-term care (LTC) nurses, had an effect on nurses’ choice of employment settings. Objective: Determine whether the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to changes in nurses’ choice of employment setting. Methods: This study used data from the 2018 and 2022 National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses to conduct a difference-in-difference analysis. We constructed a state-level measure of COVID-19 caseload, defined as COVID-19 cases per hospital bed; High versus Low COVID-19 states were defined as those above versus below the median, respectively. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of exposure to High COVID-19 caseload (vs. Low) and time (2022 vs. 2018) on nurse employment choices across inpatient, LTC, outpatient, and nonclinical settings. Results: From 2018 to 2022, the size of the US nursing workforce grew from 3.27 to 3.57 million nurses; however, RN FTEs increased in outpatient settings and decreased in all other settings. In adjusted analyses, nurses were less likely to work in LTC settings in 2022 than in 2018; yet, those exposed to High COVID-19 caseloads were 0.9% (95% CI: 0.3–1.5) more likely to work in LTC than those exposed to Low COVID-19 caseloads. Differences between High versus Low COVID-19 caseload exposure were not statistically significant for the likelihood of working in inpatient, outpatient, and nonclinical settings. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that exposure to High COVID-19 caseload was not associated with changes in nurses’ employment settings.",

    "Abstract": "Molecular alterations in the CDKN2A gene have been identified as a poor prognostic marker in a small subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). Investigations into the potential utility of p16 protein loss by immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a surrogate marker of CDKN2A deletion have revealed contradictory findings in various cancers. Recently, high concordance of MTAP and CDKN2A codeletion has been identified, suggesting the potential use of MTAP as a surrogate marker for CDKN2A deletion in various other tumor types. Our objective was to investigate the prognostic significance of MTAP and p16 expression in GISTs, with the aim of shedding light on its potential in refining risk stratification and optimizing patient management. We assembled our institutional cohort of 225 surgically resected GISTs. MTAP and p16 immunohistochemical stains were performed on the tissue microarrays, and we recorded the cytoplasmic expression (for MTAP) or cytoplasmic/nuclear (for p16) as negative (loss), weak to moderate/heterogenous (wild type), or strong diffuse (overexpression). We found MTAP loss in 11 (5%) cases and overexpression in 40 (18%), while p16 overexpression was found in 5 (2%) cases and loss in 45 (21%). Overexpression as well as loss of MTAP and p16 expression correlated with the presence of epithelioid histology (either pure or mixed with a spindle cell component), higher grade and pT-stage, necrosis, higher NCCN risk groups, and widespread disease at presentation. Overexpression as well as loss of MTAP and p16 expression predicts shortened progression-free survival and is associated with various known poor prognostic clinicopathologic parameters.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objective: Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy. NOTCH-1, a transmembrane receptor involved in cell fate regulation, may act as an oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on context. Although NOTCH signaling is implicated in many cancers, its role in EC remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between NOTCH-1 protein expression and a wide range of clinicopathological and immunohistochemical parameters, as well as its prognostic significance in EC. Methods: A total of 259 patients with EC were retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemical staining for NOTCH-1 was performed on tumor tissue sections. Associations between NOTCH-1 expression and clinicopathological features (age, tumor grade, FIGO stage, and invasion patterns) and immunohistochemical markers (ER, PR, p53, Ki-67, PTEN, CerbB2, and MSI) were evaluated. Results: NOTCH-1 expression was positive in 37 (14.3%) cases. No significant association was found between NOTCH-1 expression and age, tumor grade, FIGO stage, or invasion-related parameters. However, PR positivity ( P =0.01) and high p53 expression ( P =0.01) were significantly more frequent in the NOTCH-1 positive group. There were no significant correlations with ER, Ki-67, PTEN, MSI, or CerbB2. Conclusion: NOTCH-1 expression was not associated with key clinicopathological or survival parameters in this cohort. While some molecular correlations were observed, NOTCH-1 does not appear to have strong prognostic utility in EC. Further research integrating molecular classification and long-term follow-up is needed to clarify its potential role in tumor biology.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: We aimed to describe patient and encounter characteristics of patient portal users and nonusers and to evaluate usage of specific portal functions in a pediatric emergency department (PED). Methods: A single-center retrospective analysis of patients up to 21 years of age at an urban, tertiary care pediatric emergency department was conducted. Portal registration status of patients was analyzed. Relations between variables and usage were evaluated using logistic regression. Portal functions were analyzed for prevalence and timing of usage with respect to the PED encounter. Results: Portal users made up 48.4% of 29,881 patients. Variables associated with portal usage included multiple prior PED visits (aOR 2.19, CI: 2.04-2.35), multiple admissions (aOR 2.61, CI: 2.00-3.46), PED length of stay greater than 6 hours (aOR 1.30, CI: 1.17-1.5,) and patient Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 1.24, CI: 1.13-1.36). Non-English primary language (aOR 0.64, CI: 0.60-0.70) and patient male sex (aOR 0.90, CI: 0.84-0.96) were associated with lower likelihood of usage. About 17% of users viewed laboratory and imaging results during the PED visit, and 67% within 7 days after visit. Conclusions: Between portal users and nonusers, there are differences with respect to patient sex, ethnicity, primary language, number of prior emergency visits and admissions, and length of stay in the pediatric emergency department. Portals are not commonly accessed during visits but are commonly used to view laboratory and imaging data after the emergency visit.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most frequent subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, representing about 30% of cases. Extranodal involvement occurs in 10–20%, most commonly in the stomach. Small bowel localization is less frequent and can occasionally present as small bowel obstruction (SBO), a challenging and unusual initial manifestation. Case Presentation: A 65-year-old woman with no relevant medical history was admitted for acute abdominal pain, vomiting, and distension evolving for 48 h. Clinical examination showed abdominal tympany with no palpable masses and normal laboratory tests. Abdominal computed tomography revealed marked small bowel dilatation with a thickened, stenosing ileal segment. Conservative treatment was initiated, but persistent symptoms prompted surgery. Exploratory laparotomy revealed a 4 cm ileal lesion located 3 m from the duodenojejunal junction. Segmental resection and side-to-side mechanical anastomosis were performed. Histopathology showed a transmural proliferation of large atypical lymphoid cells. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated CD20 positivity and negativity for CD10 and Bcl-6, confirming a diagnosis of non-germinal center DLBCL. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient remained disease-free at 8-month follow-up after completing R-CHOP chemotherapy. Discussion: DLBCL of the small intestine may mimic common causes of SBO, delaying diagnosis. Cross-sectional imaging is helpful to identify the obstruction, but histological examination remains essential. Surgical resection is crucial both for symptom control and for establishing the diagnosis, after which systemic chemotherapy, usually R-CHOP, is indicated. Conclusion: Although rare, DLBCL should be considered as a differential diagnosis in unexplained SBO. Early recognition and a multidisciplinary management strategy improve prognosis.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Lemmel syndrome is a rare cause of obstructive jaundice secondary to extrinsic compression of the distal common bile duct by a periampullary duodenal diverticulum. Its nonspecific clinical presentation often leads to misdiagnosis as choledocholithiasis or malignant obstruction. Case presentation: We report a 71-year-old man with no prior medical history who presented with a 2-month history of right upper quadrant pain, progressive jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, and weight loss. Laboratory tests revealed conjugated hyperbilirubinemia and elevated cholestatic enzymes. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated bile duct dilation without intraluminal obstruction. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a well-defined periampullary duodenal diverticulum compressing the distal common bile duct, consistent with Lemmel syndrome. The patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with sphincterotomy and biliary stent placement, leading to clinical and biochemical improvement. Discussion: Lemmel syndrome should be suspected in elderly patients with obstructive jaundice when gallstones and malignancy are excluded. Cross-sectional imaging is essential for diagnosis, while ERCP offers both diagnostic and therapeutic benefits. Surgical intervention is reserved for endoscopic failure or complications. We reviewed all published cases of Lemmel syndrome over the past two decades, summarized in Table, to highlight current diagnostic and therapeutic trends. Conclusion: Awareness of Lemmel syndrome is essential to ensure timely diagnosis and appropriate management. Early identification and minimally invasive treatment can prevent severe complications and unnecessary surgery.",

The Barakat modification introduces an intraoral adaptation of the inverted L osteotomy, which enables simultaneous mandibular advancement and controlled counterclockwise rotation, eliminating the need for grafting and reducing morbidity. Cephalometric evaluation demonstrated consistent forward mandibular repositioning (mean SNB increase ≈ +1 degree) accompanied by reductions in FMA (≈ −3 to −5 degrees) and gonial angle (≈ −2 to −4 degrees), confirming effective rotational control with vertical shortening. Postoperative assessments revealed a stable occlusion, accurate bony alignment, and enhanced lower facial proportions, with no complications. The Barakat modification offers a predictable, minimally invasive solution for managing mandibular deficiency, combining advancement precision with rotational control to deliver superior aesthetic and functional outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Correcting the scaphocephalic skull shape caused by sagittal craniosynostosis has likely produced a wider variety of treatment approaches than any other single-suture synostosis. Considering that the goals of surgery are to enlarge the intracranial space to facilitate cerebral blood flow and to normalize appearance in all 3 dimensions, the ideal repair should safely and effectively accomplish both objectives. A technical variation on a remodeling procedure is presented, based on the creation of a sagittal bandeau, which provides the foundation for a correction that not only widens the posterior biparietal distance but also remedies the posterior reduction in skull height, resulting in both an expansion of the intracranial space and a normalization of appearance.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Appendicitis has traditionally been managed with urgent surgery. Because of operative room and logistic constraints, surgery may be delayed. Evidence on the impact of this delay remains equivocal. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess postoperative outcomes of delayed appendectomy amongst both pediatric and adult populations. METHODS A systematic review with meta-analysis was performed including studies comparing cohorts of urgent versus delayed appendectomy, excluding those with interval appendectomy. Studies were included as long as one relevant postoperative complication was mentioned; for adults, only prospective studies were included. A comprehensive search of six databases was performed including studies from January 1, 2000, to January 15, 2024. A meta-analysis with a random effects model and restricted maximum likelihood was used. RESULTS Of 11,227 citations, 20 pediatric and 5 adult studies were included, with 827,019 and 4250 patients, respectively. Definitions of early surgery cohorts were usually surgery within 4 to 12 hours or overnight, and delayed surgery &gt;4 to 12 hours or next day. The pediatric meta-analysis revealed no increased risk of intraoperative perforation in delayed versus emergent cohorts (odds ratio [OR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78–1.72), length of stay (mean difference, 1.2 days; 95% CI, −0.3 to −2.8), abscess (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.29–2.25), surgical site infection (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.93–1.30), or readmission (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.55–1.21). The adult meta-analysis results revealed no difference between the delayed and emergent appendectomy groups for intraoperative perforation (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.00–1.67), abscess (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.58–4.10), surgical site infection (OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.71–2.56), or conversion to open (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.64–1.03). Subgroup analyses showed increased length of stay in pediatric population (mean difference, 0.42 days; 95% CI, 0.10–0.74). CONCLUSION These findings suggest that a modest delay in appendectomy may be permissible in pediatric and adult settings and adult patients presenting with acute appendicitis. While this does not replace surgeon clinical acumen, it may help guide decision making in resource-constrained settings. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Systematic Review and Meta-analysis; Level II.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND No universal definition of trauma-induced coagulopathy exists, and no validated scoring system accurately evaluates coagulopathy in patients with severe trauma. Although developed for sepsis and other critical illnesses, the conventional Japanese Association for Acute Medicine (JAAM) disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) score's applicability to trauma populations remains controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the JAAM DIC score's diagnostic performance in patients with severe trauma and develop a trauma-specific coagulopathy scoring system based on its original components. METHODS This retrospective study analyzed data from a multicenter trauma cohort between April 1, 2018, and March 31, 2019. Patients 18 years or older with severe trauma and an Injury Severity Score of ≥16 were included. The primary outcome was defined as all-cause in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcomes were 24-hour mortality, cause-specific in-hospital mortality (exsanguination, traumatic brain injury [TBI], and others), and massive transfusion incidence. The conventional JAAM DIC variables' predictive performance for all-cause in-hospital mortality, 24-hour mortality, death due to exsanguination, TBI-induced death, and massive transfusion occurrence were assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves. A new trauma DIC score was developed using the optimal cutoff values and compared with the conventional scores. RESULTS Among 719 patients analyzed, optimal cutoff values for predicting in-hospital mortality were a prothrombin time–international normalized ratio of 1.080, fibrin degradation products of 116.0 μg/mL, and platelet count of 17.0 (×10 4 /μL). The DIC group had higher all-cause mortality rates than the non-DIC group. The new trauma DIC score outperformed the conventional score for predicting all-cause mortality, 24-hour mortality, TBI-induced death, and massive transfusion requirements; however, both performed similarly for exsanguination-induced death. CONCLUSION We developed a trauma-specific DIC score that outperformed the conventional score for predicting clinical outcomes in patients with severe trauma. While promising for trauma populations, external validation in various clinical settings is warranted. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study; Level IV.",

    "Abstract": "Summary. Since their early development in the 1980s, Simulated Allocation Models (SAMs) have helped policymakers forecast the impact of proposed allocation policy changes on patient outcomes before implementation. In the United States, models like the Kidney-Pancreas Simulated Allocation Model, Liver Simulated Allocation Model, and Thoracic Simulated Allocation Model have been instrumental in shaping organ allocation policies. Analogous models have emerged globally, including the ETKidney and Eurotransplant Liver Allocation System simulators for the Eurotransplant region, to address country and region-specific allocation challenges. This review categorizes and compares SAMs based on their core assumptions, data, and modeling approaches. We highlight challenges in model validation, the use of synthetic data, and model transparency. While simplifying assumptions are often necessary because of limited data, their influence on results should be clearly communicated to ensure policymakers can interpret model predictions accurately. Furthermore, model validation using both retrospective and prospective data is essential to assess performance under evolving policies. Greater transparency through open-source models, detailed reporting of assumptions, and validation efforts can enhance collaboration, reproducibility, and confidence in transplant research. By providing a global perspective on SAMs, this review aims to inform future research and policy development, promoting evidence-based policy development in organ transplantation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Failures of the lysosome-autophagy system are a hallmark of ageing and many disease states. As a consequence, interventions that enhance lysosome function are of keen interest in the context of drug development. Throughout the biomedical literature, evolutionary biologists have found cases in which challenges faced by humans in clinical settings have been resolved by non-model organisms adapting to wild environments. Here, we used a primary cell culture approach to survey lysosomal characteristics in species of the genus Mus. We found that fibroblasts from M. spretus, a wild Mediterranean mouse, exhibited elevated lysosomal mass and enzyme activity along with reduced activity of β-galactosidase, a classical marker of cellular senescence, compared with those from M. musculus, a related species adapted to human-associated environments. We propose that classic laboratory models of lysosome function and senescence may reflect characters that diverge from the phenotypes of wild mice. The M. spretus phenotype may ultimately serve as a blueprint for interventions that ameliorate lysosomal dysfunction under conditions of stress and disease.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Viral pathogens, like SARS-CoV-2, hijack the host’s macromolecular production machinery, imposing an energetic burden that is distributed across cellular metabolism. To explore the dynamic metabolic tension between the host’s survival and viral replication, we developed a computational framework that uses genome-scale models to perform dynamic flux balance analysis of human cell metabolism during virus infections. Relative to previous models, our framework addresses the physiology of viral infections of non-proliferating host cells through two new features. First, by incorporating the lipid content of SARS-CoV-2 biomass, we discovered activation of previously overlooked pathways giving rise to new predictions of possible drug targets. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic model that simulates the partitioning of resources between the virus and the host cell, capturing the extent to which the competition depletes the human cells from essential ATP. By incorporating viral dynamics into our COMETS framework for spatio-temporal modelling of metabolism, we provide a mechanistic, dynamic and generalizable starting point for bridging systems biology modelling with viral pathogenesis. This framework could be extended to broadly incorporate phage dynamics in microbial systems and ecosystems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract After COVID-19, identifying robust epidemic control principles is a priority of preparedness. We challenge the public health wisdom that responses must be ‘early, rapid and aggressive’ by focusing on the roles of adherence and associated fatigue for the response’s success. Using a model coupling infection transmission and human behaviour, we seek social distancing policies that optimally balance the direct epidemiological costs of an outbreak with its indirect costs. We show that adherence, fatigue and the speed at which they spread critically shape both the type (elimination, suppression and mitigation) and timing of responses depending on their interplay with policymaking priorities. Specifically, when adherence is driven solely by private perceptions, fatigue rules out elimination, limiting feasible interventions to suppression or mitigation. Suppression, prevailing at high-to-moderate health prioritization and fast individuals’ responses, needs restriction–relaxation cycles to mitigate fatigue. However, different suppression regimes emerge: while high health prioritization yields overly aggressive measures exacerbating fatigue and undermining adherence, moderate prioritization achieves similar control outcomes while sustaining adherence. Additionally, slow individual responses hinder coordination between public and individual actions, compromising response effectiveness. Effective public communication then becomes essential to realign private behaviour with collective goals. Therefore, behavioural factors should be carefully considered in future response planning.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Honeybees face an increasing number of stressors that disrupt the natural behaviour of colonies and, in extreme cases, can lead to their collapse. Quantifying the status and resilience of colonies is essential to measure the impact of stressors and to identify colonies at risk. In this article, we present and apply a methodology to efficiently diagnose the status of a honeybee colony based on a metric of its thermoregulatory capacity. This metric is derived from data-informed analysis of time series, specifically the hive’s core temperature in relation to environmental temperature. Healthy honeybee colonies have a remarkable ability to control temperature near the brood area. Our method exploits this fact and quantifies the status of a hive by measuring how resilient they are to extreme environmental temperatures, which act as natural stressors. After analysing 22 hives during different times of the year, including three hives that collapsed, we find the statistical signatures of stress that reveal whether honeybee colonies are stable or are at risk of failure. Based on these analyses, we propose a simple scale of hive status (stable, warning and collapse) that, once calibrated, can be used to diagnose hive status from a few temperature measurements. Our approach offers a lower cost and practical bee-monitoring solution, providing a non-invasive way to track hive conditions and trigger interventions to save colonies from collapse.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The foot interfaces with the ground during locomotion, absorbing and returning energy through deformation and recoil of the longitudinal arch. Energy from ‘arch recoil’ is often assumed to propel the centre of mass (COM) forward through lifting of the talus. However, recent work has shown that arch recoil lowers and posteriorly tilts the talus, lowering and posteriorly translating the COM. These two motions caused by arch recoil—posterior tilt slowing the rotation of the talus and linear actuation shortening the arch, lowering the talus—seem counterintuitive when the foot is producing positive power. How do they contribute to foot power, and how can positive power coincide with the slowing of a body? To address this, we combined biplanar videoradiography with a first-principles model of the foot. We restricted the rotation and linear actuation of the talus caused by arch recoil, then analysed the outcomes using a decomposition of the unified deformable power model. We found that restricting linear actuation did not affect foot power, while limiting rotation substantially reduced it. This shows that positive foot power during propulsion is linked with posteriorly tilting the talus rather than direct COM propulsion. These findings demonstrate how positive foot power slows the talus, potentially orienting the talus for optimal ankle positioning during propulsion.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Recent studies have highlighted intracellular viscosity as a key biomechanical property with potential as a biomarker for cancer cell metastasis. In the context of cellular mechanobiology, magnetic rotational spectroscopy (MRS), which uses rotating magnetic wires of length L = 2–8 µm to probe cytoplasmic rheology, has emerged as an effective method for quantifying intracellular viscoelasticity. This study examines microrheology data from three breast epithelial cell lines, MCF-10A, MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, along with new data from HeLa cervical cancer cells. Here, MRS is combined with finite element simulations to characterize the flow field induced by wire rotation in the cytoplasm. COMSOL simulations performed at low Reynolds numbers show that the flow velocity is localized around the wire and displays characteristic dumbbell-shaped profiles. For wires representative of MRS experiments in cells, the product of shear rate and cytoplasmic relaxation time (γ.τ with τ ~ 1 s) remains below unity, indicating that the flow occurs within the linear regime. This outcome confirms that MRS can reliably measure the zero-shear viscosity of the intracellular medium in living cells. This study also demonstrates that integrating MRS intracellular measurements with COMSOL simulations significantly improves the reliability of in vitro assessments of cytoplasmic mechanical properties.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Like humans, all birds adopt a strictly bipedal posture. However, unlike humans, birds have such good balance that they can sleep while standing up, which must require minimal energy. This makes them an interesting model for studying bipedalism in robotics. In this study, we examine balance and postural stability via a tensegrity system (assembly in parallel of rigid bodies and cables). To test this hypothesis, we created mathematical models based on anatomical observations of the legs of various birds (zebra finch, little egret, mallard and military macaw) to investigate different configurations. Building on a previous model, we demonstrate that tensegrity systems can achieve passive stability under simplified loading. Here, we aim to establish whether this model can be generalized, to determine stability, and to identify the impact of certain kinematic, dynamic and material parameters. Our results enabled us to identify the parameters that allow the model to be generalized. We determined that adding two cables corresponding to tendinous and muscular sets generalizes the model to a varied range of configurations and exploits the rear part of the foot when present. These findings offer new insights into avian bipedalism and could inspire the design of bipedal robots with passive stability for greater autonomy.",

Peat functions as a water reservoir, supporting mycelial growth and mushroom formation. There is a knowledge gap in characterizing the physical attributes of alternative materials; conventional methods are destructive and often imprecise. This research aimed to determine, over time, the physical properties of peat and two bark-based alternative casing materials using X-ray computed tomography as a novel, high-resolution approach. A microcosm culturing technique was developed to facilitate scanning. A series of scans was taken at key growth stages to assess the dynamic changes that occur within the casing over the course of a mushroom production cycle. Measurements of porosity, pore surface area and pore size distribution revealed significant differences between peat and bark-based alternatives in addition to capturing the changes within each casing material over the mushroom production life cycle. Peat was found to have greater average pore size than bark-based treatments, and this divergence in pore size distribution increased significantly between treatments over the time frame of the experiment. A significant finding of the research is that relative increases in the air-filled porosity of different casing materials may be a useful predictor of casing media performance.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Epidemic forecasting tools embrace the stochasticity and heterogeneity of disease spread to predict the growth and size of outbreaks. Conceptually, stochasticity and heterogeneity are often modelled as branching processes or as percolation on contact networks. Mathematically, probability generating functions (PGFs) provide a flexible and efficient tool to describe these models and quickly produce forecasts. While their predictions are probabilistic—i.e. distributions of outcome—they depend deterministically on the input distribution of transmission statistics and/or contact structure. Since these inputs can be noisy data or models of high dimension, traditional sensitivity analyses are computationally prohibitive and are therefore rarely used. Here, we use statistical condition estimation to measure the sensitivity of stochastic polynomials representing noisy generating functions. In doing so, we can separate the stochasticity of their forecasts from potential noise in their input. For standard epidemic models, we find that predictions are most sensitive at the critical epidemic threshold (basic reproduction number R0 = 1) only if the transmission is sufficiently homogeneous (dispersion parameter k &amp;gt; 0.3). Surprisingly, in heterogeneous systems (k ≤ 0.3), sensitivity is highest for values of R0 &amp;gt; 1. We expect our methods will improve the transparency and applicability of PGFs as epidemic forecasting tools.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Exploring the evolution of gene networks associated with metabolic/energetic homeostasis can yield key insights into the adaptive landscapes governing the physiology of extant lineages. Here, we investigate a key hormonal module of energy metabolism in reptiles. Ghrelin (GHRL), also known as the ‘hunger hormone’, is a multifunctional gastric peptide, involved in appetite, food intake and body weight regulation. We examined the genomes of 112 species comprising members of the Squamata, Testudines, Crocodilia and Rhynchocephalia and provided ample evidence that GHRL was independently lost in snakes (32 species), chameleons (four species) and toadhead agamas (two species). In accordance, the enzyme responsible for ghrelin acylation and essential for its activity, MBOAT4 (membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 4), is also eroded in these lineages. We suggest that the loss of this hormonal signalling system parallels critical modifications in energy metabolism, such as lower energy expenditure during rest, possibly linked with their unique ability to undergo large periods of fasting.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) are widely used synthetic antimicrobials that have become prevalent contaminants in aquatic environments owing to their incomplete metabolism and poor removal by conventional wastewater treatment processes. Once released into natural waters, FQs are subjected to transformation primarily through photolysis, which significantly influences their environmental fate and associated risks. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the current understanding of FQ photodegradation, focusing on three major pathways: direct, indirect and self-sensitized photolysis. Key factors affecting photolysis efficiency, including pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic matter and coexisting ions and pollutants, were critically examined. The molecular structures, ionization states and metal complexation behaviours of FQs are also discussed in relation to their photoreactivity. Emphasis is placed on the formation and toxicity of the photoproducts, some of which may exhibit greater persistence or ecotoxicity than the parent compounds. Finally, knowledge gaps and future research needs are highlighted, particularly in relation to real-world aquatic matrices and the role of emerging contaminants in modulating photodegradation processes. This review offers valuable insights for scientists and policymakers seeking to assess the risks and environmental behaviour of FQs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Lifespan disparity, a measure of variation in ages at death, can be expressed as a linear combination of standard measures of statistical dispersion in age-at-death distributions (e.g. skewness). Using data from the Human Mortality Database (HMD) (7408 life tables from 41 countries, 1751–2019), we conduct an empirical analysis of this mathematical result and assess the extent to which the moments of age-at-death distributions determine and drive lifespan disparity and trends in it. We report four findings: (i) remaining life expectancy contributes most to lifespan disparity, but its share has declined over time as the variance, skewness and kurtosis constitute larger shares; (ii) changes in skew of the age-at-death distributions have shifted and compressed mortality: distributions including older (younger) ages show increasingly positive (negative) skewness—left-leaning (right-leaning) distributions, with recent trends towards symmetric distributions; (iii) kurtosis patterns show a persistent fraction of deaths remaining at distribution extremes suggesting a plateau in the number of centenarians; and (iv) for adult populations (e.g. aged 30+), approximately 95% of life disparity values are determined from the first four standardized moments of the associated age-at-death distributions. Incorporating skewness and kurtosis yields new insights into mortality compression and lifespan variability trends.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Political issue polarization worries scholars and the public alike. To understand what drives political issue polarization, longitudinal analyses and cross-national comparative research are necessary, but difficult to implement using current measures. We propose a new technique for measuring political issue polarization which is well suited to longitudinal and comparative analyses, using a machine learning algorithm called k-means clustering, which identifies coherent groups of politically-like-minded citizens from the bottom up. We analyse the between-cluster separation, within-cluster cohesion and size parity of the clusters to quantify a society’s political issue polarization. Using American National Election Studies data, we find that polarization increased in the USA from 1988 to 2024, driven by a period of rising separation between clusters from 2008 to 2020. Using World and European Values Survey data, we find that across the world, mass issue polarization is driven primarily by disagreement over cultural issues, but manifests differently depending on a society’s level of Human Development Index (HDI), with lower-HDI countries seeing culturally conservative clusters account for a majority of citizens, and higher-HDI countries having more culturally liberal and equally sized clusters. Different societal-level predictors, including ethnic fractionalization, wealth inequality and HDI, are associated with different aspects of polarization.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Qualitative approaches provide valuable tools to explore complex behaviors, and the meta-research field is increasingly using behavioural science frameworks to examine researcher behaviour. This scoping review aimed to map and present available information on qualitative data collection instruments developed to assess researcher capability, opportunity and motivation. We applied a search strategy following PRESS principles across six major databases and a dissertations repository. The review selected 27 publications, of which 81.5% were published open access. We were able to access 89% of the data collection instruments. Although most studies (93%) developed their own instruments, only 35% mentioned a validation or pilot testing strategy. All 27 studies used behavioural models in tool development, with 85% using them to present results, 78% in the discussion and 59% in their theoretical framework. However, critical limitations persist in transparency and the deep integration of theory into research practices. These findings highlight the urgent need for clearer guidelines and higher standards in the design, reporting, and sharing of qualitative tools to strengthen data quality and transferability.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Decisions under uncertainty often emerge from the interaction of affective and cognitive processes. Using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART), this study investigated how incidental emotions (happiness, sadness, anger and fear) and prior outcomes shape risk-taking. Sixty-six participants performed the BART while exposed to images evoking emotions or neutral affect. Results revealed that exposure to anger- and fear-evoking stimuli significantly reduced risk-taking, suggesting that these highly arousing negative emotions may disrupt engagement and promote avoidance behaviors. Additionally, participants demonstrated heightened risk propensity and prolonged decision times following a successful trial, indicating a cognitive reframing of subsequent decisions after gains. These findings highlight how emotional and contextual cues jointly shape risky behavior in uncertain environments, advancing our understanding of affect-cognition interplay in decision processes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Psychological and physiological responses co-occur during stressful tasks and jointly influence performance. Yet, research on stress–performance links often focuses on single parameters in isolation, overlooking their interrelations. The current study addressed this gap using machine learning—specifically random forest regression—to identify key psychophysiological predictors of communication performance when considered simultaneously. Participants were 229 medical students who engaged in breaking bad news encounters with simulated patients. We assessed neuroendocrine and cardiovascular activity, mood states, emotion regulation strategies and stress appraisals as predictors and communication performance as the outcome. Results revealed suppression of unpleasant feelings as the strongest predictor, with greater suppression linked to poorer performance. Physiologically, better performance was associated with moderate decreases in heart rate variability, increases in cortisol and decreases in stroke volume. Analysis of joint effects indicated that suppression was especially detrimental under high physiological reactivity and among lower-performing individuals, suggesting cognitive overload under these conditions. The findings pinpoint suppression of unpleasant feelings as a maladaptive stress coping strategy, while physiological stress responses within the observed ranges appeared to enhance performance. Ultimately, addressing maladaptive emotion regulation and leveraging assessable physiological indicators—particularly heart rate variability reactivity—could inform training programmes to improve performance under stress.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Chiropteran species developed diverse sound emission systems (i.e. oral or nasal) which impose different structural and functional demands on the skull. Because peak frequency (FP) reflects key aspects of echolocation performance—such as spatial resolution, call attenuation and beam directionality—it provides a continuous, biologically meaningful proxy for sensory adaptation. To investigate how sensory adaptation influences cranial evolution, we examined the relationship between skull morphology (size and shape, quantified using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics) and FP across a macroevolutionary dataset representing approximately 65% of extant bat genera. Phylogenetic comparative methods were employed to assess skull morphological variation associated with FP. We predicted that species relying on multiple sensory strategies (e.g. frugivores) would exhibit weaker associations between skull morphology and FP compared to insectivorous species that depend more heavily on echolocation. Unexpectedly, we found that frugivorous nasal emitters presented significant skull shape (but not size) adaptations to the frequency emitted. In both insectivorous and frugivorous species, high frequencies were associated with a relatively short rostrum. Moreover, FP exerted stronger constraints on skull shape in nasal emitters than in oral emitters. Our results highlight FP as an important factor shaping skull morphology across bats, even in groups that rely on other sensory modalities.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Human language is characterized by productivity, that is, the ability to use words and structures in novel contexts. How do learners acquire these productive systems? Under a discriminative learning approach, language learning involves using cues to predict and discriminate linguistic outcomes and ‘generalization’ involves dissociating idiosyncratic irrelevant cues in favour of informative, invariant cues. The current work tests the predictions of this account using the learning of spatial adpositions as a test case. Spatial adpositions describe the location of one object in relation to another (e.g. English prepositions ‘above’ and ‘below’) and may occur in reversible sentences, such as the picture is above the window; generalization involves using these terms in novel contexts, such as with unattested nouns. Computational simulations implementing an error-driven, discriminative learning process, demonstrate that broadening the irrelevant cues associated with the stimuli may boost the discovery of invariant cues, i.e. the association between the adposition and the spatial relation. We explored the predictions of these models in human learners by adapting a training paradigm introduced by Hsu &amp; Bishop (Hsu, Bishop 2014 PeerJ2, e656 (doi:10.7717/peerj.656)) to teach typically developing 7–8-year olds spatial adpositions in an unfamiliar language (Japanese) using a computerized learning game. We manipulated the cue variability by comparing groups of children trained with more variable sentences (HV) with a condition with repetition of the same sentences (LV). A third condition (skew) tested whether learning and generalization are boosted when learning from a heavy tailed distribution that more closely resembles that of natural language. We examined the following predictions: (i) for sentences with novel nouns, participants trained with variable sentences will show better performance (i.e. stronger generalization) than those trained with repeated sentences; (ii) in contrast, those trained with repeated sentences will show stronger performance in training itself (i.e. stronger item learning); and (iii) training with a heavy tailed distribution—more closely resembling the natural one—will lead to the strongest item learning and generalization. In our main analyses, for (i) we found clear evidence that the HV condition outperformed the LV condition in generalization, in line with predictions of the computational model when trained on the same datasets. However, for (ii) the frequency advantage was not clearly observed and for (iii) skewed input did not provide an additional benefit over variability (with Bayesian evidence for the null that it was beneficial for generalization). Interestingly, the fact that the skew condition did not outperform the high variability benefit was in fact consistent with the computational modelling, although skew was found to be supportive in other domains. Finally, exploratory analyses indicate interesting individual differences in how learners respond to variability and frequency in their input, which may be owing to their current environment as well as learner characteristics.",

Opposition to this change focused on the way it might affect participation, rather than the accuracy of photo ID itself. However, research demonstrates that people are generally poor at matching unfamiliar faces, including checking ID. We tested polling clerks who were responsible for ID checks in the 2024 general election. Using standard tests of face matching, polling clerks made multiple errors in simple match/mismatch decisions (Glasgow Face Matching Test: 16% errors; Kent Face Matching Test: 36% errors), levels of performance that are typical across the population. Individual differences were large, with some clerks performing accurately, and others much less so. There was a significant decline in accuracy over age, with older clerks (on average) scoring poorly. The same tests were administered to a volunteer group of university students, who had taken no part in the election. These students made very similar levels of errors. As with the general population and other professional groups, polling clerks are prone to error in face matching. For this reason, photo ID does not provide a reliable proof of identity at the point of voting.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Ornithosuchidae are among the least studied pseudosuchians from a histological perspective. We present the first long-bone osteohistological data for the ornithosuchid Dynamosuchus collisensis, based on mid-diaphyseal thin sections of the humerus and femur, supplemented by a rib. The long bones show cortices dominated by highly vascularized woven–parallel complex and parallel-fibred bone, with three well-defined annuli and a fourth incipient one near the periosteal margin. Medullary expansion occurs through endosteal resorption, and secondary osteons in formation are present. The rib displays lower vascularization, suggesting reduced growth rates in axial elements. Open neurocentral sutures, the absence of an EFS and the lack of peripheral slowdown in cortical deposition indicate that the holotype was skeletally immature, and probably sexually immature, at the time of death. This suggests that the individual had not yet reached its maximum body size and would probably have attained a larger size, consistent with a role as a top-tier predator in Carnian ecosystems. These features support sustained rapid growth, contrasting with the predominantly slow growth of late-diverging crocodylomorphs and more closely resembling early loricatans and poposauroids. Because Ornithosuchidae occupy an early-diverging position within Pseudosuchia, these data support the hypothesis that fast growth may represent a plesiomorphic condition within the clade.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Polyglyphanodontian lizards were one of the dominant groups among squamates during the Late Cretaceous. They were widely distributed and exhibited a great range of body sizes and high morphological variation. The Asian taxa are preserved mostly as complete or nearly complete skulls or skeletons, therefore providing substantial anatomical information for the clade. Here, we describe a new polyglyphanodontian genus and species from the Upper Cretaceous of Ganzhou Basin, Jiangxi Province, China. The new taxon is diagnosed by its unique dentition, with complex posterior teeth having mesial, distal and lingual expansions, connected by crests and with depressions between. The phylogenetic analyses support an assignment of the new taxon to Polyglyphanodontia, forming an unresolved clade with Polyglyphanodon, Gilmoreteius, Adamisaurus, Tianyusaurus and Yechilacerta, or being a sister taxon to either Adamisaurus or a small clade of Tianyusaurus and Yechilacerta. The cranial and dental morphology suggests the new lizard was omnivorous, contrasting with the specialized herbivory of Tianyusaurus and Yechilacerta from the same region. Moreover, the new lizard is the first polyglyphanodontian taxon from Asia with a complex dentition, which shows similarities to that of some North American taxa, and this may suggest the evolutionary history of Polyglyphanodontia is more complicated than previously thought.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The form, magnitude and temporal dynamics of selection on phenotypic plasticity will fundamentally shape eco-evolutionary responses to environmental variation, but such attributes have not been fully conceptualized or quantified in nature. We provide a general framework that conceptualizes the dynamics of selection on phenotypic plasticity in labile dichotomous traits, which commonly shape behaviour and life history. Specifically, we highlight distinctions between selection on expressed plasticity and selection on resulting phenotypes, effects of phenotypic switches in opposite directions, and the full selection dynamics emerging across temporal sequences of environmental conditions. To enact this framework, we quantified selection on early-life plasticity in the ecologically critical trait of seasonal migration versus residence, by fitting a novel multi-state model to spatio-seasonal resighting data from 13 newly fledged cohorts of partially migratory European shags (Gulosus aristotelis). We demonstrate strong and consistent directional selection against early-life plasticity, manifested as substantially lower juvenile survival after phenotypic switches from resident to migrant, but not after reverse switches from migrant to resident. Yet, evident short-term costs translated into weaker and fluctuating selection on plasticity given sequences of phenotypes expressed throughout initial months. We thereby reveal how complex forms of selection against early-life plasticity can arise yet be rapidly attenuated in nature.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are increasing in intensity and frequency globally owing to anthropogenic climate change. Temperate mesophotic ecosystems (TMEs; 30–150 m) are light-dependent habitats that generally experience cooler and more stable temperatures than adjacent shallow zones, potentially leading to intraspecific differences in thermal tolerance between shallow and mesophotic populations. Sponges, often the dominant benthic organisms in TMEs, show varied responses to thermal stress. We hypothesized that shallow-water sponges may be more resilient to heat stress than conspecifics from upper-mesophotic depths. To test this, we exposed Rowella lancifera sponges from one shallow and one upper-mesophotic population to a simulated MHW and measured respiration, buoyant weight, mortality and microbial community composition. Temperature records from the preceding year confirmed cooler, more stable conditions at upper-mesophotic depths. Sponges displayed strong stress responses under MHW exposure, resulting in high mortality, but responses did not differ between depths. Elevated respiration rates also coincided with microbial community shifts. Overall, our results indicate that a 1°C increase above previous MHW peaks could cause widespread mortality in R. lancifera.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract From social interaction to foraging, the survival of newborn animals depends on their ability to make adaptive decisions without prior experience. While ethological research focused on strong innate biases, recent empirical evidence shows that early preferences are often weak, transient and variable. After reviewing these findings, we introduce a novel model that explains how multiple weak biases can support adaptive choices in naive, inexperienced animals. We propose a self-supervised strategy in which naive animals combine internal predispositions with environmental structure to guide behaviour. First, predispositions target features that are rare in the background but common in relevant stimuli (e.g. red colour, upward movement), thus reducing false positives. Second, the evolution of multiple weak biases allows animals to increase accuracy of decisions using co-occurring cues (e.g. colour, sound and movement). Weak biases are advantageous as they prevent strong responses to misleading partial matches. Requiring the co-occurrence of multiple rare cues supports effective choices in complex environments with many misleading stimuli. This simple self-supervised strategy offers a new framework for understanding early decision-making, with implications that span across behavioural ecology, developmental psychology, comparative cognition and artificial intelligence, where decision-making with sparse evidence is a crucial challenge.",

In static broth cultures, the air–liquid interface (ALI) provides a high-oxygen niche typically colonized by mat-forming strategists. In Pseudomonas fluorescens, single mutations that upregulate cellulose production give rise to ‘wrinkly spreader’ (WS) types—canonical niche specialists that out-compete ancestral types at the ALI. Here, we show that this view can be refined: WS mutants often fail to establish when introduced alone at low density, but co-culture with ancestral types rescues colonization. Microscopy and simulations reveal that ancestral types physically scaffold the ALI, enabling attachment and facilitating the in situ emergence of diverse WS mutants. Ancestral types later disperse, allowing WS expansion. This transient asymmetric interaction shows that even strongly adaptive mutations may rely on ecological facilitation. More broadly, our findings highlight the reciprocal links between ecology and evolution, revealing how transient ecological dependencies can shape adaptive trajectories.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Plant–pollinator interactions have become a major research area because of their impact on key ecosystem services. One pollinator behaviour of particular importance is flower constancy, the tendency to temporarily focus on one flower species during a foraging trip, thereby promoting cross-pollination. The costs and benefits of flower constancy for plants and pollinators are varied, complex and far from understood. This review aims to synthesize studies spanning the last decades, from both plant and pollinator perspectives. Flower constancy is often viewed as an epiphenomenon of pollinator cognition, but there is increasing recognition that pollinators show remarkable behavioural flexibility in their flower choice, often in response to ecological and social factors. Plants usually benefit from flower constancy, which reduces pollen loss and interspecific pollen transfer. However, in some situations, pollinator inconstancy can be advantageous owing to increased visits from pollinators shared with co-flowering plants, a process called facilitation. The fitness consequences of pollinator behaviour for rare or invasive plants are intriguing yet little understood, with important implications for plant conservation. Rather than seeing flower constancy as a strategy imposed on pollinators by cognitive constraints, this review emphasises that plants and pollinators pursue varied agendas depending on their ecological context and lifestyle.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The tropics hold most of the planet’s biodiversity but face significant knowledge gaps. This is particularly concerning in the Brazilian Amazon, where anthropogenic disturbances are driving species loss. Our study focused on sarcosaprophagous flies, a group with key roles in public health and ecosystem functioning. Using 8244 occurrence records of flies and machine learning, we mapped knowledge distribution at three levels: families, the best-sampled species and a null model simulating chance knowledge probability. Analyses revealed substantial biases. Sampling was uneven, with approximately 40% of forested areas showing &amp;lt;10% probability of occurrence for families and species, while 80% of the region aligned with null expectations. Knowledge probability increased with accessibility, and species were better documented in degraded areas, exceeding chance expectations, whereas remote areas of high conservation value, including Quilombola territories, were neglected. These patterns were consistent across taxonomic levels, highlighting that addressing knowledge biases requires more than increasing research effort. Our findings underscore the importance of studying less-charismatic groups, such as sarcosaprophagous flies. We bring new insights into the value of targeted surveys in remote areas and collaborative engagement with local traditional communities, essential for building a comprehensive understanding of biodiversity and promoting effective conservation in the Amazon.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In biogeography, related lineages often share similar range sizes and species richness due to inherited traits and shared geographic history. This expectation is based on phylogenetic niche conservatism and shared dispersal constraints. However, within the subfamily Laevilitorininae, this pattern is not observed: Laevilitorina shows broader distributions and higher species richness than Laevilacunaria despite similar developmental mode and habitat preferences. Combining multilocus genetic data, radular morphology and model-based historical biogeography, we aim to understand the origins of these disparities in range extent. The paraphyly detected in both Laevilitorina and Laevilacunaria genus indicates a more complex history than a simple older–younger genus contrast, with age and diversification distributed across four clades. Our dated analyses place the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of Laevilitorininae at 52.2 Mya, with diversification within clades from the Miocene to Pleistocene. The sister genera show process-level contrasts: in Laevilitorina, broad ranges in some lineages are consistent with intermittent, macroalgal raft-mediated connectivity, whereas Laevilacunaria exhibits restricted ranges consistent with rare, storm-facilitated rafting that enables colonization without sustained gene flow. Overall, our findings support how stochastic long-distance dispersal and establishment can shape biogeographic patterns in the Southern Ocean and underscore the need to update systematic classifications.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Artificial light at night (ALAN) is a pervasive anthropogenic pollutant, increasing in intensity and scope. While its impacts on biological and ecological processes are well documented among terrestrial taxa, marine organisms have received less attention, though a quarter of the world’s coastlines are affected by artificial light at night. Furthermore, the intergenerational effects of artificial light at night have never been documented in the wild. We conducted a field manipulation experiment in the lagoon of Mo’orea, French Polynesia, using LED (Light-Emitting Diode) lights to test artificial light at night’s effects on adult life-history and offspring fitness of the coral reef anemonefish Amphiprion chrysopterus. Exposing adults and embryos to LEDs, we found artificial light at night enhanced adult growth but did not alter measured reproductive traits, including fecundity. We observed reduced parental reproductive hormone levels with downstream consequences for offspring. Hatching success was unchanged, but offspring showed reduced embryonic heart rate and yolk sac size, and drastically diminished larval escape responses and swimming performance. This comprehensive study is the first in a wild organism to demonstrate combined intergenerational and direct negative effects of artificial light at night, highlighting limited compensatory capacity. These impacts could impair larval recruitment and hinder population replenishment in reef fish. This research underscores urgent need for conservation and management to address artificial lighting impacts.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Ambrosia beetle gallery systems are typically excavated into the xylem of host trees by a single mated female and are generally considered to function as independent units. However, field observations suggest that interactions among gallery systems may also occur. Using X-ray tomography to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of ambrosia beetle galleries in flood-stressed and ethanol-injected trees, we found that intersections, where two or more galleries excavated by different females merge at one or more points, and intrusions, where a female begins excavating her gallery from within a gallery previously abandoned by another female of a larger species, are recurrent phenomena. We also observed that intraspecific intersections were generally more frequent than interspecific ones, regardless of tree treatment. These intraspecific intersections may represent a potential mechanism for cross-fertilization among the offspring of different founding females, thereby potentially increasing opportunities for outbreeding in these otherwise inbreeding species. Interspecific intersections, which could potentially facilitate lateral transfer of symbionts, occurred less frequently than expected, suggesting that ambrosia beetles may actively avoid such interactions. Overall, our study highlights that interactions among gallery systems may play a key role in shaping ambrosia beetle communities and their symbiotic networks, warranting further investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Habitat destruction and invasive species pose two of the greatest global threats to biodiversity. These factors do not operate in isolation, and nowhere is their interaction more apparent than in urban environments. Urban organisms rapidly evolve under novel ecological circumstances where they also encounter anthropogenic opportunities for range expansion. We examine the role of urbanization in the invasive success of the spotted lanternfly, an emerging global pest, during its colonization and expansion. We demonstrate that the invasive population in the United States has undergone three sequential bottlenecks, resulting in significantly reduced genetic diversity and elevated inbreeding. The success of this invasive population may be partly attributable to adaptation in the native range before the invasion. We detect divergence between urban and rural lanternflies in Shanghai, China (the invasion origin), in genes related to stress response, metabolism and detoxification pathways. Additionally, we detect genomic signatures of selection in the invasive population, suggesting adaptive refinement as the invasion progresses. This study provides evidence of adaptive evolution in response to urbanization despite substantial loss of genetic diversity and implicates adaptive responses to pesticide application, dietary shifts, and climate in the invasive success of the spotted lanternfly.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Marine mammals, fish and fisheries exploit overlapping prey resources; yet the causal nature of their interactions remains unresolved due to limited data and complex ecosystem dynamics. In this study, we combine food web modelling with causal inference to quantify causal effects between marine mammals and commercially important fish species in the Norwegian Sea and Barents Sea. We first extract multiple food web dynamics from an existing mass-balanced linear inverse food web model and use these as inputs to causal modelling. A key methodological step is to translate the food web network into a temporally explicit causal diagram. By mapping biomass flows onto causal links, we quantify causal effects for both the short term (1 year lag) and the long term (30 year simulation). We find that the increase in marine mammal biomass has predominantly negative and potentially large—but highly uncertain—effects on fish biomass. In contrast, an increase in fish biomass produces smaller, positive effects on marine mammals. Long-term simulations reveal dampened impacts, indicating partial compensation over time. The results from this study, which combines food web dynamics modelling with causal inference, can support more precise, data-informed and ecologically grounded fisheries and marine mammal management in the North Atlantic.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Many species delimited by morphological data contain two or more species that are distinct based on molecular data (i.e. cryptic species). Cryptic species have important implications for ecology, evolution and conservation. For example, morphology-based species of limited conservation concern can contain cryptic species that are in imminent danger of extinction. Here, we examined the prevalence of cryptic species across vertebrates. We also examined the controversial use of mitochondrial data, and whether they overestimate or underestimate cryptic species relative to nuclear data. We obtained usable estimates of species limits from 373 studies. We found that each morphology-based species contained approximately two cryptic species on average. This number was surprisingly similar across major groups despite dramatic differences in ecology and physiology (fishes versus birds), and similar to comparable estimates in insects. Cryptic species numbers from mitochondrial data alone were often higher than from nuclear data, but were generally not statistically different. Overall, our results show that cryptic species are numerous and widespread across vertebrates. These results suggest that cryptic species should not be ignored in analyses of species richness, speciation and extinction in living and fossil organisms. Furthermore, testing for cryptic species across morphology-based vertebrate species should be an urgent priority for conservation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The role of DNA methylation in regulating transcriptional activity and post-transcriptional modifications in insects, particularly in social insects, remains debated. Social insect castes, primarily determined by differential gene expression, exhibit pronounced phenotypic differences in morphology, life history traits and behaviour. In some ants, parasites induce divergent phenotypes, but the role of DNA methylation in this remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined DNA methylation patterns across different tissues (brain and fat body) and castes (queens and workers) in the ant Temnothorax nylanderi. We also compared healthy workers with those infected with the cestode Anomotaenia brevis, which is associated with changes in lifespan, morphology and behaviour. Our results reveal significant differences in gene body methylation across tissues, which were positively linked to gene expression. We also observed caste-specific differences in DNA methylation, particularly in the fat body. Surprisingly, however, we detected no differences in DNA methylation between cestode-infected and healthy workers, despite pronounced differences in transcriptional activity, suggesting that other epigenetic mechanisms exert stronger regulatory control over parasite-induced transcriptional changes. The pronounced differences in DNA methylation between tissues and castes, partly associated with transcriptional variation, warrant further investigation into their functional role, including the modulation of alternative splicing.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Many evolutionary radiations involve diversification of exaggerated sexual displays, but little is known about how they are formed. It has been theorized that there can be multiple stable equilibria in the evolution of sexually selected traits, by which multiple species having distinct sexual displays and mate preferences can stably persist. However, these theories alone do not fully explain the speciation process because the stability of each equilibrium will impede the formation of a new species from an existing species that is already occupying one of the stable equilibria. To explain the evolutionary process that forms species with diverse sexual displays, we here propose that hybridization between phenotypically similar but genetically divergent lineages can catalyse speciation by sexual selection, via the creation of genotypic and phenotypic variation. Using evolutionary simulations, we show that hybridization giving rise to variation in mate preference and sexual displays can alter the sexual selection regime, thereby creating opportunities for evolutionary shifts towards previously unoccupied stable equilibria. Thus, hybridization can facilitate evolutionary exploration of the stable evolutionary equilibria that sexual selection generates, leading to speciation accompanied by the diversification of exaggerated sexual displays.",

Few studies have documented this process or its long-term consequences in complex natural environments. Here, we used copepod resting eggs of Leptodiaptomus minutus from three time periods of lake ecological history, spanning approximately 200 generations (100 years) in two populations impacted by historical acidification. Whole genome sequencing of the resting eggs revealed significant allele frequency shifts associated with the acidification, followed by pH recovery. We used a resurrection ecology approach to retrace adaptive shifts concomitant with environmental transitions. Copepods from the pre-acidification period showed sensitivity to acidity, while individuals from the acidification period were adapted to acidic pH. This tolerance was subsequently lost during pH recovery, implying an adaptive reversal. Demographic models indicated a decline during the acidification process, followed by population recovery based on historical data, suggesting that selection led to evolutionary rescue. This study fills a critical knowledge gap about the long-term implications of evolutionary rescue in the wild.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Conventional sex roles imply that males compete more vigorously with each other for fertilizations, whereas females are more selective in choosing a mate. As a consequence, mating and reproductive success is typically more variable in males (Bateman’s principles). However, Charles Darwin already mused that some species may defy these principles, resulting in stronger sexual selection in females than males, but empirical evidence has been mixed. We studied the potential for sexual selection in two sympatric coucals—a bird family with high sex-role variability. In sex-role-reversed black coucals, females compete for territories while males provide parental care. In white-browed coucals, sex roles are flexible. Females of both species had steeper Bateman gradients than males, suggesting females benefit from multiple mating. Male black coucals benefitted from sneaking copulations with their social mate while she prepared clutches for other mates—a male strategy not conceptually included in Bateman’s principles that focuses on the number of mating partners, but not on increasing reproductive success by repeatedly mating with the same partner. Our findings support reversed Bateman’s principles, with females having a higher potential for sexual selection than males. Sex-role flexibility allows females to secure additional mates and emancipate themselves from parental care, and it allows males to invest in parental care and emancipate themselves from pre-copulatory competition.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Invasive species often cause ecological damage, including competition with native species for space, food and survival. One of these invasive species is the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), a fish introduced into fresh and brackish waters around the world. To understand how round gobies perform if they continue spreading into higher-salinity oceans, we investigated how individuals differ in physiological and behavioural (co)sensitivity to salinity changes. We measured growth, metabolic rates, activity, dispersal and exploration of 59 individuals in the lab after acclimation to salinities ranging from freshwater to seawater (0, 10, 19, 24 and 28 ppt), and quantified trait variation and sensitivity to salinity as reaction norm intercepts and slopes. The fastest-growing individuals at 10 ppt—the salinity the fish were caught at—were also the most active and explorative at this salinity and thus more likely to spread. However, above 15 ppt, these individuals lost their growth advantage and experienced the most severe reductions in aerobic capacity (maximum metabolic rate and aerobic scope). As growth and aerobic capacity are linked to survival and performance in nature, this cross-over at 15 ppt is likely to determine the phenotypic composition of round goby populations across salinities and their continued invasion success and ecological impact.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction. The increasing resistance and the pathogen’s complex multi-drug resistance mechanisms made the selection of effective antimicrobial treatments more challenging for Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ). The study aimed to explore the effect of Scutellaria baicalensis , Prunella vulgaris and antimicrobial peptide LL-37 on the virulence factors of P. aeruginosa . Hypothesis. Previous studies have shown that extracts from traditional Chinese medicines, Scutellaria baicalensis and Prunella vulgaris , can also enhance the effects of antibiotics and reduce antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa . Antimicrobial peptide LL-37 shows the potential as a new-generation candidate for treating multi-drug-resistant bacteria, which has advantages over traditional antibiotics, whilst the combination role between Scutellaria baicalensis , Prunella vulgaris and LL-37 in P. aeruginosa remains unknown. Aim. We explored whether the combined use of Scutellaria baicalensis , Prunella vulgaris and LL-37 can exert antibacterial effects through the quorum sensing (QS) system. Methodology. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of Scutellaria baicalensis , Prunella vulgaris and LL-37 were determined for PAO1 and PA-ΔlasI/rhlI using micro broth dilution. The antibacterial activity of Scutellaria baicalensis combined with LL-37 and Prunella vulgaris combined with LL-37 was also assessed. The growth abilities of PAO1 were analysed after being treated with Scutellaria baicalensis , Prunella vulgaris and LL-37, respectively. Elastase secretion was measured using Congo red-elastic proteinase assays. And the expressions of QS genes ( lasI , rhlR ) were analysed by real-time PCR. Results. Single or combined treatments of Scutellaria baicalensis and LL-37 and Prunella vulgaris and LL-37 would significantly reduce elastase secretion. There were no significant differences in proliferation between the groups at any timepoint. All treatments downregulated lasI and rhlR gene expressions. Conclusion. Scutellaria baicalensis , Prunella vulgaris and antimicrobial peptide LL-37 all down-regulate the QS system-related genes of P. aeruginosa , inhibiting the secretion of virulence factors and reducing bacterial toxicity.",

    "Abstract": "Cationic peptides, particularly those rich in arginine and/or lysine residues, are usually promising antimicrobial agents effective at low concentrations in laboratory settings. However, their applicability in pharmaceutics and biotechnology is currently limited due to their susceptibility to biological enzymatic processes and (in some cases) toxicity to host cells. To address this, we screened eight linear arginine-rich peptides for their haemolytic properties and antimicrobial activity using a set of computational and experimental assays. Inspired by our previous results on R4F4, we then designed three modified peptides based on an R4F4 backbone, R4F4-C16, D -R4F4 and cyclic R4F4, and one based on R4 (R4-C16). Amongst the tested linear peptides containing only natural amino acids, R4F4 exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity; however, this effect was reduced in the presence of human serum and trypsin. Conversely, our study demonstrated that cyclization and substitution to its d -amino acid enantiomer significantly enhanced stability and activity of R4F4, whilst in the presence of proteases. As revealed by fluorescence imaging, microscopy RNA sequencing analysis, the mode of action involves complex and dynamic events. This multifaceted antimicrobial mechanism integrates alterations in membrane permeability, modulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and changes in transcriptomic signature profiles. At the molecular level, notable changes were observed in the bacterial expression of genes associated with metabolic pathways and biological processes. Furthermore, R4F4-derived peptides showed substantial antibiofilm activity in preventing the formation and disruption of mature biofilms, together with good cytocompatibility, highlighting the potential for clinical applicability. In conclusion, this study emphasizes the importance of optimizing the stability of peptide-based antimicrobials, particularly those rich in arginine, and highlights the advantages of incorporating d -amino acids and cyclization for enhanced performance. This information will prove useful in the future design of antimicrobial peptides. In addition, the molecular perspective on peptide-induced gene expression changes, as identified by RNA-seq, broadens our understanding of antimicrobial peptides’ activities and provides a clearer picture of their versatile mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Agency theory predicts that agents tend to have more information regarding their own talents and efforts than their principals. This information asymmetry enables chief executive officers (CEOs) to “shirk” or engage in actions that benefit themselves at the expense of shareholders. To circumvent this adverse outcome, firms engage in monitoring efforts. One method is monitoring through high-quality accounting information, which can alleviate agency conflicts by reducing information asymmetry. Direct observation of employees’ performance is another monitoring method. This paper examines whether low accounting quality will increase a board’s tendency to use direct observation to alleviate agency conflicts between managers and shareholders. Design/methodology/approach Monitoring through accounting entails evaluating CEO performance on financial performance targets; monitoring through direct observation involves evaluating CEO performance subjectively. This study uses (1) firms utilizing Big Four auditors, abnormal accruals and earnings’ ability to predict future cash flows as proxies for accounting quality and (2) discretionary bonuses paid to CEOs as an indirect measure for a board's direct observation. Findings We find that a board is prone to employ direct observation to reduce agency conflicts that low accounting quality exacerbates. Research limitations/implications Because we obtain CEO compensation data from large public firms, findings in this study might be limited to large firms. Practical implications The findings in this study can be applied to other areas involving agency conflicts. For example, future research can examine a board's use of direct observation to determine the promotion or dismissal of executives if their firm has low accounting quality. Originality/value Our study shows that public firms can still utilize direct observation to mitigate agency conflicts that low-accounting quality aggravates, even though monitoring through accounting is often viewed as a more efficient monitoring mechanism in public firms.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose In light of the fast-paced digital transformation, this paper aims to examine the effectiveness and adoption of cybersecurity frameworks in higher education institutions (HEIs). Design/methodology/approach The methodological approach involved a systematic literature review that synthesized evidence from recent studies to classify and evaluate cybersecurity frameworks that are relevant to HEIs. Findings The study identifies three main types of frameworks, which are maturity and capability models, governance-based and collaborative structures, and technical and operational mechanisms. COBIT 5, Zero Trust and risk assessment models are frameworks that enhance institutional safety only when they are aligned with governance, resources, cultural norms and user experience. Persistent issues include fragmented adoption, minimal cooperation among educational institutions, and a preference for normative rather than alternative methods. Integrating ethical considerations and training with cognitive theory, as well as postincident learning mechanisms, are among the best practices. Research limitations/implications The limited number of empirical studies focusing on HEIs and the geographic preference for developed areas restrict the impact of the findings presented in this review. Practical implications The results offer practical advice for HEIs to implement tailored, holistic cybersecurity frameworks that address resilience, collaboration and culture adaptation beyond just compliance. Social implications HEIs should prioritize cybersecurity to protect their teaching, research and innovation, as well as intellectual capital and public trust. Originality/value This paper presents a methodical examination of cybersecurity management frameworks in HEIs, emphasizing both technical and socio-technical aspects, providing premise development for culturally sensitive and sustainable strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This qualitative study explores the motivations, challenges and competencies of physically challenged women entrepreneurs in the emerging economies such as Bangladesh. This study also attempts to investigate the skills of women entrepreneurs who are physically challenged by showcasing their experiences to increase their capacity to initiate and run their own businesses. Design/methodology/approach The study examined the business experiences of 12 Bangladeshi physically challenged women entrepreneurs using narrative inquiry. Entrepreneurs from three districts of the southern part of Bangladesh with at least three years of experience were chosen as respondents of this study. This method was used to record responses by having participants narrate stories about their daily entrepreneurial activities. Findings The current research revealed that physically challenged women entrepreneurs are motivated by self-reliance, the opportunity to support family and the scope to be a role model. Their challenges include societal stigma, financial burden, skill-related problems, physical disabilities and broken marriages. Research limitations/implications The survey was limited to the business owners in the Khulna Division of Bangladesh. Consequently, it is suggested that future studies be conducted covering the whole country and empirical investigations in this area are strongly encouraged. Practical implications The study provides deeper insight into the experiences of women entrepreneurs with physical disabilities in developing countries. Findings of the study can support these entrepreneurs and assist enterprises, policymakers and academics in expanding opportunities for disadvantaged entrepreneurs. Additionally, by using the life experiences of physically challenged women entrepreneurs, this research offers insightful advice to women who want to start their own companies. Social implications Many stakeholders, including women who are physically sound and physically challenged, entrepreneurs, academics, students, and legislators, benefit from this study. By using the experiences of accomplished physically challenged women entrepreneurs, this research offers insightful advice to women who want to start their own companies. The research will be especially helpful to policymakers because it emphasizes the need for services such as accessible loans, family support networks, soft loans, training sessions, and courses specifically designed for physically challenged women entrepreneurs. Overall, by addressing relevant issues and creating encouraging circumstances, this research can improve the number of women pursuing entrepreneurship. Originality/value This research uniquely examines Bangladeshi physically challenged female entrepreneurs’ motivations, challenges and competencies in a developing economy. The research sheds new insight into how physical limitations affect entrepreneurship in developing countries by spotlighting these entrepreneurs’ real-life experiences and skills.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study examines the relationship between institutional and economic hardship factors in shaping entrepreneurship rates across countries. Specifically, it explores the impact of economic freedom as an institutional determinant and the Misery Index (sum of unemployment and inflation) as an indicator of economic hardship on business creation rates. The aim is to assess how these factors interact in fostering or constraining entrepreneurial activity. Design/methodology/approach A panel data analysis was conducted using data from 70 countries covering the period 2017–2023, resulting in 288 observations. An unbalanced panel data model was applied and fixed-effects and random-effects models were considered. The Hausman test indicated that the random-effects model was the appropriate specification for this dataset. The empirical approach allowed for a robust examination of the impact of economic freedom and the Misery Index on entrepreneurial activity. Findings The results reveal that an increase in the Misery Index negatively affects business creation, with a one-unit rise leading to a 2.3% decline in entrepreneurial activity (p = 0.0196). Conversely, economic freedom has a positive impact, as a one-point increase results in a 0.31% rise in entrepreneurial activity (p = 0.0079). However, the explanatory power of the model is limited (R2 = 16.39%), indicating that other contextual and individual-level factors significantly influence entrepreneurship rates. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature by providing empirical evidence about the interplay between economic freedom and economic hardship in shaping entrepreneurship rates. The study highlights the stronger negative impact of economic hardship relative to the positive effect of institutional quality. The findings underscore the need for further research on additional contextual and individual determinants of entrepreneurship, offering valuable insights for policymakers and stakeholders involved in fostering entrepreneurial ecosystems.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Lean Healthcare (LH) aims to increase patient value, enhance quality and reduce waste across processes. However, in hospital settings, the assimilation of LH into routine practice is impeded by multiple barriers that challenge both implementation and sustainability. This study aims to identify these barriers, explains their underlying causes and delineates potential resolutions (strategic pathways) through the lens of Organizational Learning (OL) theory. Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive systematic literature review (SLR) (Web of Science and Scopus) was conducted, followed by content analysis. Barriers and strategic pathways were coded and classified across OL theory and validated by experts. Findings By conducting an SLR, the authors have systematically categorized the impediments to LH across organizational, group/team and individual levels, elucidating their interconnected nature based on OL theory. In addition, this research systematizes pathways to address each barrier and group them by OL dimensions, offering a coherent mechanism linking barriers to targeted interventions. Practical implications The framework helps hospital leaders diagnose barrier profiles and choose mutually reinforcing learning pathways (e.g. leadership engagement, structured training, cross-functional teams, measurement and feedback) to accelerate and sustain LH initiatives. Originality/value This research, therefore, serves as a dual-purpose tool: it expands the theoretical application of OL Theory in healthcare and provides a pragmatic framework for healthcare professionals seeking to realize the full potential of LH.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study examines why healthcare professionals in public hospitals may still express intentions to leave their organizations despite reporting favorable levels of workplace well-being and affective commitment. It introduces ambivalent identification as a mediating mechanism that helps explain turnover intention in the public sector. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the job demands–resources model and social identity theory, survey data were collected from 520 administrative and healthcare personnel in two Colombian public hospitals. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (SmartPLS) was used to test the relationships among workplace well-being, affective commitment, ambivalent identification, and turnover intention. Findings Results show that workplace well-being and affective commitment are negatively associated with ambivalent identification, while ambivalent identification is positively related to turnover intention. Mediation analyses confirm that ambivalence transmits the effects of well-being and commitment on turnover intentions. These findings highlight that even committed and engaged employees may consider leaving when organizational identification is marked by unresolved tensions. Originality/value The study advances public management research by integrating ambivalent identification into turnover models, extending the job demands–resources framework, and applying social identity theory to a Latin American public healthcare context. It highlights identity-based mechanisms that help explain why traditional retention resources may be insufficient in public hospitals and offers practical guidance for managers seeking to detect and address ambivalence to strengthen workforce stability.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Owing to the great advances in sensor and cybernetic technologies, fault detection and classification (FDC) has become a crucial application in Industry 4.0. Recently, there has been growing attention to contrastive learning techniques to transform raw data into discriminative feature representations. The purpose of this study was to develop a novel contrastive learning model to enhance the FDC tasks for maintaining qualified performance in manufacturing processes. Design/methodology/approach In this study, a Centroid-Concentration Contrastive Learning (C2CL) framework is proposed to tackle several obstacles to representation learning in FDC applications. With the introduced centroid-orientation concept, the encoder trained by the C2CL framework can generate more discriminative feature representations with inter-class distraction and intra-class concentration. Findings The C2CL architecture employs a transformer-based encoder to effectively capture the relationships and dependencies among different parameters in long manufacturing processes. With the proposed variation-enhancement strategy, C2CL could effectively tackle the similar class-pattern issue. We integrated the centroid effect to construct the contrastive learning model. In the embedding space, we maximized the distances among centroids of classes to clearly distinguish each class, while minimizing the distances of all samples to their class centroids to concentrate the embedding vectors of all instances in the same class. Originality/value Based on the centroid concept, C2CL can derive more discriminative embeddings and enhance the classification or detection in downstream FDC tasks. Several experiments were conducted on real industrial datasets to demonstrate the superiority of C2CL over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various evaluation metrics. We also use a case study to show the practicability of the proposed framework for fault classification in smart manufacturing.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Negative travel posts are increasingly common, yet we know little about how their tone shapes the parasocial route from influencer relatability to destination-related intentions, especially among Gen Z. This study aims to conceptualize relatability as a dual path: perceived similarity (cognitive) and perceived emotional closeness (affective) and test a moderated mediation model in a between-subjects experiment. Design/methodology/approach In total, 347 Chinese Gen Z’ers participated in a between-subjects experiment. After exposure to a standardized post, participants reported similarity, closeness, parasocial interaction (PSI) and destination-related consumption intention. Findings Structural analyses show that both similarity and closeness significantly increase PSI, which in turn robustly predicts destination intentions; smaller but meaningful direct effects from similarity and closeness to intentions remain, indicating partial mediation. Critically, tone qualifies only the first stage: humorous posts strengthen the association between perceived similarity and PSI, whereas the association between perceived closeness and PSI is robust to tone. Conditional indirect effects via PSI are significant, and the model explains substantial variance in PSI and intentions. Practical implications Managerially, when targeting audiences for whom “being like me” is the lever, humorous negative posts are more effective; where closeness is already high or cultivated, tone is less pivotal for sustaining PSI and downstream intention. Originality/value The authors add to the limited research examining how humorous and vulnerable negative posts differentially activate similarity and closeness. Theoretically, the authors disentangle the cognitive and affective routes of relatability and demonstrate that content tone primarily leverages the similarity pathway rather than closeness.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study reviews the economic consequences of firms' Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices. Unlike previous reviews that treat ESG as a monolithic concept, this paper employs the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) framework to systematically examine how different ESG topics generate distinct economic impacts. Design/methodology/approach A three-stage systematic review was conducted using Scopus database searches combined with manual screening of top accounting journals. The search strategy incorporated topic-specific terms for nine ESRS categories (five environmental and four social topics) combined with economic consequence indicators. Quality screening based on the ABDC journal list yielded a final sample of 90 papers from 25 accounting journals spanning 2005–2025. Findings The review reveals substantial disparities in research attention across ESG topics. Climate change, consumers, and the own workforce dominate the literature, with these three dimensions accounting for the vast majority of studies examined. Critically, biodiversity and circular economy have received no empirical examination of economic consequences in accounting literature, while water, affected communities, and workforce in the value chain remain severely under-researched. The geographic concentration in U.S. studies and methodological limitations constrain generalizability. The mechanisms translating ESG practices into economic value remain largely unexplored. Originality/value This is the first systematic review to disaggregate ESG economic consequences using the ESRS framework, revealing differential impacts across specific sustainability topics. The study identifies critical research gaps, particularly in neglected topics, and provides a roadmap for future research as mandatory ESG disclosure expands globally.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to validate a short-form scale for measuring positive employee experience. Despite extensive discussions in research and practice on the definition and measurement of employee experience, few scales have been developed with methodological rigor, particularly focusing on employees' motivational psychological states. Design/methodology/approach Survey data were collected from employees in a South Korean chemical company. Structural equation modeling was used to cross-validate the positive employee experience scale. Additionally, a Chinese version was validated across different cultural contexts through comparative analysis. Findings The short-form positive employee experience scale, comprising six items across six dimensions, has been validated.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This research aims to examine the pedagogical and gamification quality of financial literacy applications available in the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) markets. Design/methodology/approach Using a preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses -compliant search strategy, the authors searched the App Store, Google Play and Web applications and identified 312 finance-related titles. After filtering for relevance and duplicate titles, eight of the highest-ranked apps were content-analyzed using a 33-item rubric that combined pedagogical, gamification, technical and usability features with privacy and security features. Findings Only eight apps (12%) passed the basic requirements for structured financial literacy. The average compliance with the rubric was 54%. Gamified widgets such as progress bars and savings pots were used in every app, whereas multi-layered game systems with badges, quests and awards appeared only 25% of the time. Only 15% of the time did sequenced curricula address higher-order themes. Less than half had privacy policies or safeguards for youth data that met standards. They also map apps on a pedagogy × gamification alignment grid: most cluster in the low-pedagogy/moderate-gamification quadrant; none fall in the high-pedagogy/high-gamification quadrant. Research limitations/implications The contribution is a GCC-specific benchmark and an operational alignment map to guide design and policy for culturally grounded financial education. This study provides a transparent, GCC-specific benchmark and alignment map that regulators, banks and educators can use to improve the quality of youth financial education apps. They also outline an eight-area research agenda for the future. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first cross-market, theory-anchored audit of GCC financial literacy apps, expanding fintech research beyond transactional functionality to educational outcomes and providing a culturally integrated perspective that is often missing from global assessments.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to examine the relationship between managerial ownership and corporate carbon performance using a sample of A-share listed industrial firms from 2007 to 2022. It explores the internal mechanisms through which managerial ownership influences carbon performance and identifies contextual factors that shape this relationship. The research contributes to the literature on corporate governance and sustainable development by offering empirical evidence on how ownership structure affects environmental outcomes. Design/methodology/approach An empirical approach was adopted using a panel dataset of Chinese industrial firms. The study investigates the relationship between managerial ownership and carbon performance through econometric models and a series of robustness checks, including alternative variable specifications and an instrumental variable approach. Mechanism analyses examine Type I and Type II agency costs as mediators, while subgroup analyses assess the moderating effects of analyst attention and state ownership. Findings The results indicate an inverted U-shaped relationship between managerial ownership and corporate carbon performance, suggesting that moderate levels of ownership are associated with better performance, while very low or high levels are less effective. Mechanism analyses confirm that Type I and Type II agency costs mediate this relationship. The inverted U-shaped effect is more pronounced in firms with low analyst attention and in state-owned enterprises, highlighting the influence of external monitoring and ownership structure. Originality/value This study provides empirical evidence on the impact of managerial ownership on corporate carbon performance, highlighting both its underlying mechanisms and contextual factors.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to tackle the issues of signal distortion and performance instability caused by environmental interference when high-sensitivity silicon dioxide optical waveguide resonator acoustic sensors (OWRAS) operate in real-world, complex underwater environments, such as those with turbulence, noise and pressure variations. The core objective is to enhance the sensor’s practical environmental adaptability. Design/methodology/approach A novel protective encapsulation design is introduced, utilizing polyurethane as the sound-transparent material due to its excellent acoustic impedance matching with water. A standardized underwater acoustic testing system was constructed to conduct a comparative performance analysis between the encapsulated sensor and a reference hydrophone. The evaluation comprehensively assessed key operational conditions, including environmental noise, source level detection, turbulent disturbance, dynamic sound source and hydrostatic pressure. Findings The experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of the encapsulated sensor. Its noise level is comparable to that of the reference hydrophone, with a high level of consistency in source-level measurements. The sensor maintains stable output under turbulence and dynamic sound sources, matching the reference hydrophone’s trends, with negligible 0.1 dB sensitivity drift after 3 MPa hydrostatic pressure exposure. These results collectively validate its exceptional mechanical stability and environmental robustness. Originality/value The core originality lies in the specialized polyurethane encapsulation structure designed specifically for OWRAS, effectively balancing acoustic transparency with mechanical protection. Through systematic environmental adaptability verification, the high-performance laboratory devices have been advanced one step toward practical engineering applications, providing key technical support and practical evidence for the reliable use of optical underwater acoustic sensors in complex marine environments.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Home range (HR) is a key indicator of animal spatial ecology. HR size, shape, location and habitat composition reflect both species' ecological requirements and their responses to anthropogenic stressors. Felidae , a charismatic taxon, faces escalating threats mainly due to habitat degradation and human–wildlife conflict. Understanding the ecological and anthropogenic drivers of HR size variation is therefore critical for their conservation. To address this gap and explore these factors at a global scale for the entire taxon, we used the HomeRange database—a global database with HR values across 960 different mammal species—complemented with about 20% additional records, to compile 1137 individual HR size estimates from 29 out of 40 recognized wild felid species. We applied generalized linear mixed models to assess the influence of intrinsic, methodological, ecological and anthropogenic factors on space use. HR size was shaped by multiple drivers. It increased with body mass (0.94 ± 0.16; p &lt; 10 −8 ) and was larger in males than in females (0.51 ± 0.07; p &lt; 10 −13 ), consistent with higher energy demands and sex‐specific reproductive strategies. HR size decreased with increasing productivity (−0.37 ± 0.07; p &lt; 10 −7 ) and felid richness (−0.24 ± 0.10; p = 0.02), suggesting reduced spatial requirements in resource‐rich areas and under interspecific competition. HR size also decreased with increasing croplands (HR: −0.50 ± 0.14; p &lt; 10 −3 ) and pastures (HR: −0.16 ± 0.07; p = 0.02)—both human footprint proxies—which may reflect multiple causes such as anthropogenic food sources, habitat loss or movement restriction from infrastructures associated with agriculture. Our results reinforce the role of well‐known established HR size's predictors such as body mass, sex and primary productivity while highlighting the impact of less frequently investigated factors (i.e. felid richness and agricultural land‐use). Our findings emphasize the importance of incorporating a broad range of biological, environmental and methodological predictors when studying space use across a taxonomic group. Our approach provides novel insights into habitat requirements and the effects of anthropogenic pressures, which can ultimately lead to improved conservation strategies for felids.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Some animals exhibit large‐amplitude fluctuations with periods close to their generation length. These fluctuations can be caused by seasonal environmental influences, scheduled pesticide applications, or ecological factors such as intraspecific regulation and consumer–resource interactions. While theory provides various mechanisms for how environmental and ecological factors might generate generational fluctuations, there has never been a field experiment testing the relative contributions of seasonal demographic synchronisation and intraspecific regulation to generation cycles in natural populations. The smaller tea tortrix, Adoxophyes honmai , is a serious pest of tea plants and a temperate multivoltine insect that undergoes 3–5 large‐amplitude generation cycles each year under natural conditions in Japan. Theory suggests that these fluctuations may represent limit cycles driven by asymmetric intraspecific interference, where older larvae directly affect younger ones. However, in the field, these populations also experience strong seasonality and periodic insecticide applications that are thought to either generate or modify these fluctuations. We conducted a replicated field‐cage experiment on the tortrix populations to manipulate the initial degree of stage synchrony and the timing of introduction. The experiment included four treatments contrasting pulsed versus continuous age structures at the onset of spring, along with two introduction timings separated by 20 days (approximately half a generation time). We minimised artificial interventions, such as harvesting and insecticide application, as well as the effect of natural enemies while allowing meteorological influences during the season. To compare the field‐cage experiment results with theoretical predictions, we constructed an age‐structured population model featuring asymmetric larval interference. We executed simulations using the same introduction scenarios as in the field‐cage experiment. We observed the emergence of clear generational cycles in all treatments of the field‐cage even in the absence of any initial demographic synchrony. This suggests an internal mechanism regulating population cycles, possibly intraspecific interference. However, the generational cycles in the field‐cage were synchronised across treatments and with outer field populations. The results from the field‐cage experiment and simulation analyses indicate that external environmental factors, such as precipitation, acted as a pacemaker for the generational cycles created by the internal regulatory mechanism.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Absentee housing ownership is a crucial but underappreciated element of contemporary inequality. Most often, absenteeism is treated as a secondary or subsidiary process to other manifestations of housing injustice, and even where it is examined, it is usually conceptualized as a binary. However, like essentially all geographical processes, absenteeism is best conceived of in more relational and flexible terms that take account of the variety of forms in which it might manifest, including absentee ownership within the same city or metro area. This article seeks to promote such a perspective by developing a framework for the multi‐scalar and relational analysis of the geographies of absentee housing ownership. Using a case study of Atlanta, Georgia, our empirical analysis demonstrates that the geographies of absentee ownership tend to follow a bifurcated pattern, where predominantly poorer and Blacker neighborhoods are more likely to be owned by absentee owners nearer by. However, high levels of absentee ownership, albeit of a very different character, are also present in wealthier and whiter communities, with more of the properties in these areas being owned at much greater distances. Ultimately, this article argues for greater attention to absentee housing ownership across a range of contexts in order to understand its multiple geographic manifestations.",

The most striking features of the internal anatomy were the presence of two hearts with different characteristics, three lungs with two tracheas, three kidneys as well as a doubled liver. Vascular aberrations and other organ deformities are described in detail. The monozygotic origin of the present parasitic conjoined twin was shown by genetic sequencing, analysis and relatedness calculations based on individual tissue samples from the autosite and the parasite. As the free ranging 1 year old mother of this twin returned every year to the same well monitored nursery colony in Norway to give birth to its pups, we can present the life history of the mother bat including the reproductive data of five more consecutive years. This enabled us also to evaluate the birthing process of the conjoined twin in the light of physiological behavioural birthing data.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Ending the abuse of older people in Australia is a national policy priority. Harmonisation of financial enduring power of attorney (FEPOA) legislation is regularly called for to protect against financial elder abuse. A FEPOA is a legal instrument by which an adult appoints one or more people to manage their legal obligations, money and property, particularly during periods of incapacity. Although older Australians are urged to make FEPOAs, and a majority of those over age 65 report having one, these instruments are implicated in an estimated 50%–85% of cases of financial elder abuse. This commentary offers a critical perspective on legislative harmonisation as a policy intervention to prevent financial abuse committed via FEPOA arrangements. We address three main issues. First, we explain several approaches to harmonisation, illustrated with examples from different areas of law‐making, noting that harmonisation is often a slow process that does not achieve uniformity. Second, we argue that deficiencies in knowledge and practices that create risks of financial abuse via FEPOAs will not be cured by harmonisation alone. Third, we highlight that the legislative variation across states and territories provides opportunities for innovation in research. Further investment in high‐quality research is essential to guide effective legislative and compliance strategies to prevent the financial abuse of older people.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Improving government‐business relations is critical to fostering entrepreneurship. Using panel data from 282 Chinese cities over 2017–2022, this study empirically examines the impact of government‐business relations on entrepreneurship. The findings are as follows: (1) Government‐business relations stimulate both innovation entrepreneurship and business entrepreneurship, particularly when the relations are close. (2) For innovation entrepreneurship, this positive effect is stronger in non‐resource‐based cities, central cities, and transportation hub cities. For business entrepreneurship, the effect is more pronounced in port cities, cities with flat terrain, and cities with a better commercial credit environment. (3) Mechanism tests indicate that government‐business relations foster both types of entrepreneurship by enhancing market potential, reducing institutional costs and improving environmental governance performance. These findings not only enrich the theoretical understanding of the relationship between government‐business relations and entrepreneurship but also deepen insights into how institutional environments influence innovation and business, providing policy implications for local governments to optimise government‐business relations, improve the business environment, and promote innovation and business.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Interpretations of physiological arousal may be a key pathway connecting stress‐related physiological arousal intensity to physiological and affective consequences of stress. Expressive suppression is linked to increased perceptions of stressors as threatening, which may exacerbate associations between physiological arousal intensity and interpretations of physiological arousal as debilitative. However, the effect of expressive suppression on the association between perceptions of physiological arousal intensity and interpretation remains untested. A sample of 224 undergraduate students completed two psychological acute stress tasks and rated the intensity of their perceived physiological arousal and whether they believed this physiological arousal to be facilitative or debilitative. Before the second stress task, half of the participants were randomly assigned to be instructed to engage in expressive suppression during the task; the remaining participants were instructed to not suppress their emotional expressions. Experimental group assignment moderated associations between physiological arousal intensity and interpretation. In the suppression group, within‐person increases in physiological arousal intensity were more strongly associated with more debilitative physiological interpretations. The present study suggests that engaging in expressive suppression during stress causes increases in the intensity of perceived physiological arousal to be interpreted as more debilitating, with implications for stress‐related anxiety.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Recent advancements in scene editing based on 3D Gaussian splatting techniques have achieved significant progress. However, existing scene editing methods still face critical limitations. One notable drawback is the inability to achieve cascading effect propagation—i.e., the automatic and consistent updating of associated elements such as shadows in response to object manipulations. Furthermore, most current methods perform object editing directly on 2D images, leading to inconsistencies across inputs from multiple viewpoints. In this paper, we present a novel pipeline named GauComp, focusing on address the task of object removal in 3D Gaussian‐based scenes, with automatic removal of associated shadows. The proposed method comprises three core stages: Shadow‐aware 3D Segmentation, Gaussian Completion, and Gaussian Refine. The Shadow‐aware 3D Segmentation stage establishes bidirectional associations between objects and shadows, enabling robust 3D scene segmentation by integrating 3D semantic modelling with instance‐level shadow detection. The Gaussian Completion stage leverages Normal‐aware PatchMatch to search for similar gaussian primitives from the same scene for 3D Gaussian completion to ensure geometric consistency during scene editing. Finally, the Gaussian Refine stage improves the quality of scene restoration by constraining the Gaussian optimization process, effectively suppressing errors such as false cloning and incorrect splitting. Experimental results demonstrate that GauComp significantly enhances restoration quality, completing scene editing and restoration within 54 seconds, thereby providing an efficient and high‐fidelity solution for 3D scene editing and restoration.",

A proliferative nodule (PN) may develop within CMN, and in some cases, atypical proliferative nodules (APNs) with distinct histopathological features may arise, complicating clinical diagnosis and management. This report describes a case of a giant infantile CMN with APN and novel genetic findings, including TPR::NTRK1 gene fusion and MCL1 amplification. An 8‐day‐old male presented with a large, uniform, hairless black lesion on the plantar skin. Histological examination revealed nevomelanocytes arranged in a nest‐like pattern within the epidermis and dermis. The PN displayed distinct boundaries, with spindle‐shaped and oval cells exhibiting pleomorphism, and diffuse infiltration into the subcutaneous fascia and skeletal muscle. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated diffuse positivity for HMB45, Melan‐A, and S‐100 in nevus cells. In the PN, pan‐TRK was positive, CD99 showed weak and focal expression, P16 was retained, and PRAME was negative. Genetic analysis revealed a TPR::NTRK1 gene fusion and MCL1 amplification, suggesting a molecular basis for the atypical features observed in the nodule. This case highlights the role of TPR::NTRK1 fusion in driving abnormal melanocyte proliferation and the potential contribution of MCL1 amplification to tumor progression. These findings provide insights into the genetic underpinnings of APN in CMN and suggest potential therapeutic targets for high‐risk lesions.",

    "Abstract": "Summary Background and Objectives : Chemotherapy‐induced alopecia, encompassing both acute reversible alopecia and its persistent form, significantly impacts patients' quality of life but remains inadequately addressed. This study aimed to compare dermatologists' and oncologists' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding chemotherapy‐induced alopecia, as well as their awareness of scalp cooling as a preventive intervention. Patients and Methods : A cross‐sectional survey was conducted in Israel at nine tertiary medical centers using a structured questionnaire to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to chemotherapy‐induced alopecia, including separately analyzed persistent chemotherapy‐induced alopecia and scalp cooling. Responses from dermatologists and oncologists were compared, and factors influencing knowledge scores were identified. Results : Both groups demonstrated limited knowledge. Oncologists scored higher on acute chemotherapy‐induced alopecia (mean 3.88 vs. 2.74, p &lt; 0.001), while dermatologists tended to score higher on persistent chemotherapy‐induced alopecia (mean 7.85 vs. 6.92, p = 0.063). Male participants scored lower than female participants (p = 0.050). Oncologists were more familiar with scalp cooling, citing cost and logistical issues as significant barriers; dermatologists emphasized the need for proactive care and education. Conclusions : Significant knowledge gaps and differing practices between dermatologists and oncologists underscore the importance of targeted educational initiatives and interdisciplinary collaboration to improve patient care.",

    "Abstract": "Aim To describe the epidemiology of cerebral palsy (CP) and access to related services on Tanna Island, Vanuatu, a low‐income country in the Pacific region with limited data on childhood disability, including CP. Method A population‐based register of children (aged 0–18 years) with CP was established on Tanna Island. Children with suspected CP were identified using the key informant method and assessed by a multidisciplinary team for clinical diagnosis. Data were collected on demographics, aetiology, clinical characteristics, rehabilitation, and education using a culturally adapted case record form from the Global Low‐ and Middle‐Income Country CP Register. Results Of the 98 children assessed, 52 had CP and two acquired brain injury. The observed prevalence of CP was 3.4 per 1000 in the paediatric population; mean age at diagnosis was 8 years 1 month (SD = 5 years 1 month). Sixty‐three per cent ( n = 34) of children had primary motor‐type spasticity, 43% ( n = 23) were classified in Gross Motor Function Classification System levels III to V, 43% ( n = 21) were severely underweight, 83% ( n = 45) had never received any rehabilitation, and 79% of school‐age children ( n = 30 of 38) did not attend school. Interpretation The prevalence and motor severity of CP is alarmingly high on Tanna Island, Vanuatu. Delayed diagnosis and lack of access to rehabilitation and education highlights the urgent need for early diagnosis, intervention, and rehabilitation services for children with CP in Vanuatu.",

Although extensive research exists on international talent mobility, there is limited evidence on their intranational movement. This study closely analyses a large‐scale talent‐attraction policy implemented in Chinese cities to relocate top high‐skilled workers. Using a unique, hand‐collected dataset of CVs from all economics faculty members in China (2014 to 2018), we find that these policies significantly influence locational choices, favoring cities in more developed regions.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Patatin‐like phospholipase domain 3 ( PNPLA3 ) I148M (rs738409 C&gt;G) variant has been reported as a risk factor for metabolic dysfunction‐associated steatotic liver disease/steatohepatitis and contributes to hepatic fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, its role in recurrence after liver resection remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of PNPLA3 variants on HCC recurrence after liver resection. Methods One hundred sixteen patients with non‐viral HCC who underwent curative liver resection were retrospectively analysed. PNPLA3 rs738409 genotype was identified using blood‐derived genomic DNA. Recurrence‐free survival (RFS) was compared across genotypes, and multivariate analysis was performed to identify the independent risk factors for recurrence. Postoperative changes in fibrosis indexes over 2 years were also evaluated according to genotype. Results The number of patients in each PNPLA3 genotype group was as follows: CC ( n = 20), CG ( n = 55) and GG ( n = 41). The CG/GG group showed significantly poorer RFS than the CC group, and multivariate analysis identified the PNPLA3 CG/GG genotype as an independent risk factor, especially for late recurrence. To better evaluate the effect on the remnant liver, patients with early recurrence were excluded from the study. In the CG/GG group, the fibrosis indices worsened over the 2 years following surgery, whereas they remained stable in the CC group. Among the patients with CG/GG, those with worsening fibrosis had a significantly higher rate of late recurrence. Conclusions Patients with the PNPLA3 CG/GG genotype, especially those with progressive fibrosis, have a high risk of recurrence after liver resection. PNPLA3 genotyping may help identify patients at high risk of late recurrence who require careful long‐term surveillance.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Pokkah Boeng disease (PBD), caused by Fusarium sacchari , has severely impacted the yield and quality of sugarcane, resulting in significant economic losses. However, the molecular interaction mechanisms between F. sacchari and sugarcane remain poorly understood. In this study, we identified the GH12 family protein FsEG1, secreted by F. sacchari , as a critical virulence factor. Further analysis demonstrates that the hydrolase activity of FsEG1 is essential for the full virulence of F. sacchari . The enhanced immune responses and cell death induced by FsEG1 in N. benthamiana depend on the recognition of oligosaccharide elicitors derived from the degradation of host cell walls by FsEG1, which are detected by membrane‐localised receptors NbWAKs and NbCERK1, and this process also necessitates RAR1 and MAP3Kα to facilitate intracellular signal transduction. Consequently, FsEG1 activates DTI (DAMP‐triggered immunity) rather than the conventional PTI. The stable transgenic sugarcane plants carrying the FsEG1 RNAi hairpin construct displayed high levels of resistance to F. sacchari and decreased FsEG1 expression, production of specific FsEG1 siRNA in transgenic HIGS sugarcane plants was confirmed by stem‐loop qRT‐PCR; at the same time, the stable transgenic sugarcane plants with ectopic expression of FsEG1 also showed enhanced PBD resistance with activated expression of defence‐related genes. Overall, these findings establish a foundational basis for investigating the molecular mechanisms that govern the interactions between F. sacchari and sugarcane and offering valuable insights into enhancing sugarcane's resistance to PBD.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Plant branching, encompassing both vegetative and reproductive forms, is a complex and crucial process that shapes overall architecture and determines crop yield and biomass. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as master regulators in fine‐tuning the intricate genetic and hormonal networks that govern plant branching. This review systematically synthesises recent advances in understanding how miRNA‐target gene modules regulate essential pathways to orchestrate the branching patterns. We highlight a central insight that specific miRNA families form hierarchical, stage‐specific networks that facilitate the independent optimisation of vegetative and reproductive branching. Furthermore, we explore the potential applications of miRNA manipulation in optimising branching architecture to improve crop yield. By critically evaluating strategies such as artificial miRNAs, target mimics and CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, we discuss how modulating miRNA networks can engineer ideal plant architecture. Finally, we provide a forward‐looking perspective on overcoming challenges in miRNA‐based crop improvement, emphasising the integration of single‐cell omics and epigenetic insights to achieve precise genetic modifications. This review underscores the transformative potential of miRNAs in designing future crops for enhanced productivity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Party cues can influence public opinion, but the extent to which they do so varies dramatically from context to context. Why? The long‐standing theory that party cues function as “heuristics” provides an answer, predicting that variation in exposure to policy information, a propensity for effortful thinking, or both causally affects the influence of party cues. However, this prediction has escaped decisive empirical testing to date, leaving in its wake a string of mixed results. Here we characterize the challenges that limit previous tests, and report on two large‐scale experiments designed to overcome them. We find that exposure to policy information causally attenuates the influence of party cues, but engagement in effortful thinking per se does not. Our results advance understanding of the “when” and “why” of party cue influence; clarify a number of previously ambiguous findings; and have broad theoretical, methodological, and normative implications for understanding the influence of party cues.",

In contrast, this study focuses on the experiences of those who had already decided on abortion and describes how they avoided or selectively engaged with CPCs prior to obtaining abortion care. Methods I draw upon interviews with 16 abortion patients in Mississippi from June 2021 to March 2022. I recruited participants from social media and through Mississippi's lone abortion clinic. The semi‐structured interviews focused on participants who were aware of CPCs' antiabortion mission at the time of the interview and why they avoided or engaged with these centers prior to their abortions. I analyzed transcripts for themes related to participants' experiences with CPCs. Results Participants described different strategies for interacting with CPCs, including deliberate avoidance based on prior knowledge of CPCs' antiabortion stance and strategic engagement to access ultrasounds or emotional support. Some participants interpreted stigmatizing practices as care, while others reported misinformation, deception, and attempted stigmatization that they explicitly resisted. Conclusion While CPCs remain a challenge to reproductive autonomy, many clients, including abortion patients, successfully bypassed or managed their CPC experiences in ways they found beneficial while circumventing CPCs' goals.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The “racist cop” stereotype is one of the most prominent social representations of law enforcement in the United States. Drawing on theories of stereotype threat and stigma, this article suggests that this negative stereotype creates an identity threat that heightens anxiety and stress among law enforcement officers, increasing the risks of their burnout. Using survey data collected from officers in a state‐level law enforcement agency in 2021, we find that White officers, as well as those who reported greater stress during the 2020 protests, express stronger concerns about being perceived as racist. These concerns are associated with elevated levels of burnout, and efforts to maintain a positive self‐image partially mediate this relationship. These findings hold even after controlling for burnout levels reported by the same officers in 2019. Overall, our results extend stereotype‐threat research to a high‐power public service context and underscore the need for organizational interventions that reduce stereotype‐related stress and support officer well‐being.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: This systematic review will examine the association between pesticide use and cancer incidence among farm workers. Introduction: Farmers are the most essential part of many countries’ agriculture-based economies. Several studies have identified acute and chronic hazards associated with pesticide use, including lymphoma, leukemia, brain tumors and other cancers. However, no systematic reviews have comprehensively assessed the association between pesticide use and cancer incidence among farmers. Eligibility criteria: Primary observational studies (case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional) that include participants who are farm workers (farmers, their spouses, and seasonal workers) in any geographic location and that document exposure to pesticides associated with cancer incidence will be eligible for inclusion. Methods: Academic databases (PubMed, Web of Science Core Collection, Ovid Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ProQuest Health and Medical Collection), non-academic databases (Google Scholar up to 20 pages), and other gray literature (OAIster, Shodhganga, and medRxiv) will be searched. Two reviewers will independently screen titles/abstracts and full texts, with adjudication by a third reviewer. Critical appraisal of the included studies will be performed using JBI checklists. Quantitative outcomes on the association of pesticide exposure and cancer incidence will be pooled in statistical meta-analysis, where possible. Heterogeneity between studies will be assessed statistically using standard χ 2 and I 2 tests. Where statistical pooling is not possible, the findings will be presented narratively. Certainty of the evidence regarding the carcinogenicity of pesticides will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Healthy articular cartilage can sustain near-frictionless motion within the joint; in vivo friction coefficients fall well within the superlubricity regime (&amp;lt;0.01). However, despite nearly a century of study, the mechanisms underpinning these behaviors remain unclear. This uncertainty has been compounded by how cartilage's operating conditions have been defined and extended to explant testing approaches, resulting in drastically varied tribological responses. To address these discrepancies, we compared friction coefficients results from a comprehensive set of historical cartilage explant tribology studies, and from new data evaluating testing configuration (stationary contact area [SCA] vs convergent SCA [cSCA]) and lubricant choice (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] vs. synovial fluid [SF]) on friction. These data demonstrate that the SCA, the most common testing configuration utilized, consistently reports friction greater than the migrating contact area (MCA) and cSCA configurations. Intriguingly, while the SCA and MCA are almost universally slid at sub-physiological speeds (∼1mm/s), the cSCA has routinely been tested at greater, and more physiologically consistent speeds (∼60mm/s). Nevertheless, SF drives noticeable reductions in friction within both SCA and cSCA studies. Importantly, particularly in vivo, only rapidly slid, SF-lubricated cSCA cartilage explants reliably demonstrate biofidelic friction (&amp;lt;0.005), indicating that hydrodynamic-related phenomena must not be discounted in cartilage lubrication. Collectively, these results underscore the need to further probe mechanisms of sustained cartilage superlubricity, a key finding only recently replicated via the cSCA configuration. Such knowledge will be crucial to understanding the true lubrication capacity of articular cartilage.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Experimental characterization of brain white matter (BWM) using Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and numerical modeling is expensive, time-consuming, and constrained by computational limitations and model approximations. To address the scarcity of high-fidelity data, this study develops a machine learning (ML) workflow to predict single-frequency viscoelastic properties, specifically the homogenized storage modulus, of BWM. The dataset originates from a sensitivity study conducted in house where BWM was modeled as a 2D triphasic composite of axons, myelin, and glial matrix. The triphasic unidirectional composite only considers 2D mechanics and diffusion in the transverse plane (perpendicular to axonal direction). Microstructural properties such as fiber volume fraction, intrinsic phase moduli, and axonal geometry were used as features for the ML model. Ensemble of regression and decision tree-based models, coupled with hyperparameter optimization, were explored, with model interpretation performed using SHAP analysis. Decision trees yielded the best predictive performance, with SHAP highlighting the importance of glial moduli and fiber volume fraction. This ML framework offers a surrogate to expensive in vivo characterization, provides insight into BWM mechanical dependencies, and can serve as a foundation for future inverse models aimed at understanding aging, dementia, and traumatic brain injury mechanisms in neuroimaging studies",

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) concurrently monitors cortical activation and functional connectivity to evaluate neural engagement and recovery. Visual feedback guides participants, while forearm EMG and brain activity from the moving limb are recorded to train deep learning models that classify physiology movement and cognitive load in real time. Quantitative performance metrics, including average trajectory deviation and non-dimensional squared jerk, assess movement accuracy and smoothness, correlating with task complexity. The platform also incorporates a robot impedance control scheme and an interactive interface to adapt assistance dynamically based on predicted movement. By integrating biomechanical performance data with neural indicators, this approach enables a personalized, data-driven rehabilitation framework.",

    "Abstract": "Electrorheological (ER) effect describes the formation of particle structures within a suspension of polarizable, semiconducting particles dispersed in an insulating medium upon application of an electric field. This phenomenon creates columnar structures that span the electrodes, facilitating a transition from liquidlike to solidlike behavior and markedly improving the fluid’s rheological properties. This study investigates the phenomenon referred to as electromechanical strengthening. We found that simultaneously applying an electric field and large-amplitude oscillatory shear deformations to ER suspensions substantially enhanced their linear rheological properties, compared to the response observed under small or moderate-amplitude oscillations. At small and moderate oscillation amplitudes, the width of the columnar structures remained largely unchanged, resulting in minimal dependence of storage and loss moduli on strain amplitude. The columns began to associate and formed a ringy pattern beyond a certain threshold of large strain amplitudes, accompanied by a more than tenfold rise in the dynamic moduli. At sufficiently large strain amplitudes, the disruptive mechanical forces surpassed the structuring effect induced by the electric field, leading to the erosion and thinning of the assemblies and a subsequent decline in both storage and loss moduli. The coupled electromechanical strengthening effect is demonstrated to be a generic feature of ER suspensions, manifesting independently of the suspended particles’ chemical composition, morphological characteristics, or the dimensional scale.",

    "Abstract": "Volcanic eruptions have considerable impacts on climate across various timescales; however, it remains uncertain if, and how, volcanic activity could drive climate change over multiple millennia. Here we incorporate realistic volcanic forcing into a large ensemble of glacial era–coupled atmosphere-ocean model simulations. These simulations are constrained by sulfate records from ice cores, which help estimate the timing of past major eruptions. We investigate how volcanic eruptions may have occasionally triggered abrupt climate change during the last glacial period. Our results show that very large equatorial eruptions can induce large changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation via atmospheric and ocean circulation changes and air-sea buoyancy fluxes, potentially pushing the climate system between persistent warm and cold states lasting millennia. A simplified perspective of the dynamics shows how unforced natural climate variability may exert a stabilizing influence decades after an eruption, especially as the system nears a tipping point.",

    "Abstract": "Hybrid incompatibility can lead to lethality and sterility of F1 hybrids, promoting speciation. The cell biological basis underlying hybrid incompatibility remains largely unknown, especially in mammals. Here, we found that female hybrids between Mus musculus domesticus and Mus spicilegus mice are sterile due to the failure of homologous-chromosome separation in oocyte meiosis, producing aneuploid eggs. This nondisjunction phenotype was driven by the mislocalization of the cohesin protector, SGO2, along the chromosome arms instead of its typical centromeric enrichment, resulting in cohesin overprotection. The upstream kinase, BUB1, showed a higher activity in hybrid oocytes, explaining SGO2 mistargeting. Higher BUB1 activity was not observed in mitosis, consistent with viable hybrid mice. Cohesion defects were also evident in hybrid mice from another genus, Peromyscus , wherein cohesin protection is weakened. Defective cohesion in oocytes is a leading cause of reduced fertility. Our work provides evidence that a major cause of human infertility may play a positive role in mammalian speciation.",

    "Abstract": "Anxiety and insomnia are highly comorbid; however, the underlying brain-circuit mechanisms remain inadequately explored. Here, we identify a dual-functional ensemble within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) that modulates both anxiety-like behaviors and insomnia through distinct neural circuits. Specifically, a subset of BNST neurons exhibits enhanced activity in response to anxiety-related cues and during wakefulness. Activation of these ensemble neurons exacerbates anxiety-like behaviors and reduces non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep in chronic restraint stress (CRS) mice. Conversely, inactivation of these neurons alleviates anxiety-like behaviors and promotes NREM sleep. In addition, anxiolytic-hypnotic medication attenuates BNST stress ensemble hyperactivity, mitigating both phenotypes. Furthermore, BNST stress ensembles project divergently to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and the preoptic area (POA): DRN-projecting neurons selectively modulated anxiety, whereas POA-projecting neurons specifically regulated sleep-wake states. These findings suggest that hyperactive BNST stress ensembles are responsible for inducing anxiety-like behaviors and disrupting sleep in CRS mice and achieve the modality specificity through their divergent downstream targets.",

    "Abstract": "Photoacoustic imaging has become a powerful tool for visualizing the brain morphology, function, and metabolism. However, severe optical scattering and high-frequency acoustic attenuation within the brain degrade the performance of photoacoustic brain imaging. To address such limitation, we propose a line scanning–based photoacoustic computed mesoscopic (PACMes) approach for noninvasive, high-resolution, and longitudinal visualization of cerebral vasculature inside the intact mouse brain. This technique uses converging near-infrared (NIR) lines scanned at multiple angles for tight optical excitation; a low-frequency, full-ring ultrasound transducer array for high-sensitivity detection; and a compound reconstruction algorithm integrating filtered back-projection and optical localization of photoacoustic signals to recover the image. We perform long-term (&gt;5 months), noninvasive imaging of the entire cortex of mice through the intact scalp and skull with a field of view of 13 millimeters and a spatial resolution of 33 micrometers. The results demonstrate the potential of PACMes for investigating brain function and disease.",

However, the relatively low output voltage of aqueous systems continues to limit their achievable energy density. The aqueous electrolyte occupies a central role in addressing this limitation because it mediates ion transport and interfacial reactions at both the cathode and anode; accordingly, advances in electrolyte design are indispensable to meet future performance demands. In this review, we elucidate the core bottlenecks in aqueous electrolyte design, distill molecular-level design principles, and outline feasible pathways for future practical implementation.

    "Abstract": "Marine snow forms at the ocean surface, sinks to depth, and ultimately enables carbon sequestration in the seabed. Fast-sinking marine snow particles, such as diatom aggregates, encounter a rapid increase in hydrostatic pressure during their descent. Using incubations in rotating pressure tanks, we found that pressure levels corresponding to 2- to 6-kilometer water depth induce leakage of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from diatom aggregates equivalent to ~50% of their initial carbon contents. The leaked DOM proved to be diatom-derived and changed the amount and composition of DOM in the surrounding seawater substantially. Ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, high protein-like fluorescence, and low carbon:nitrogen ratios classified the leaked DOM as labile. The bioavailability of leaked DOM was demonstrated by its rapid utilization by a pelagic microbial community, leaving mainly recalcitrant DOM behind. Pressure-induced DOM leakage likely weakens the gravitational “biological carbon pump” and supplies labile DOM to the pelagic microbiome of the deep ocean.",

    "Abstract": "Current US Food and Drug Administration–approved chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies for B cell leukemias and lymphomas target CD19, which is widely expressed across the B cell lineage, often leading to on-target, off-tumor B cell depletion, prolonged immune suppression, and antigen-negative escape in a subset of patients. In contrast, B cell receptor (BcR) signaling is essential for the survival of most mature B cell neoplasms, and BcRs carrying the immunoglobulin heavy variable gene IGHV4-34 are highly enriched in B cell malignancies compared with normal B cells. Further, self-reactive IGHV4-34 + serum autoantibodies are enriched in aggressive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and other autoimmune diseases. Here, we developed CAR T cells targeting the BcR carrying IGHV4-34 (CART4-34). We found that CART4-34 showed specific cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion toward IGHV4-34 + malignant B cells. In addition, although CD19 was down-regulated upon relapse after treatment with CART19, IGHV4-34 + BcR levels remained intact upon relapse after treatment with CART4-34, suggesting reduced risk of antigen-negative escape. In IGHV4-34 + HBL1 cell line–derived xenograft mouse models, CART4-34 showed robust expansion and antitumor activity comparable to those of CART19. Optimized CAR:BcR binding using shorter CAR hinge domains improved immune synapse morphology and in vivo activity. In addition, we showed that CART4-34 could target human IGHV4-34 + SLE B cells and deplete IGHV4-34 + autoantibodies ex vivo, without targeting healthy B cells or affecting total IgG titers. In conclusion, we developed a CAR T cell product that specifically targets pathogenic B cells in lymphoid malignancies and SLE, offering potential for precision cell therapy for these indications.",

Intranasal administration may be more relevant for preventing infection, but the pharmacokinetics of intranasal influenza antibodies is unknown. We present results of preclinical studies and first-in-human phase 1 trials of the intranasally administered CR9114, an anti–hemagglutinin stem antibody that protects against influenza A and B viruses. We tested safety and tolerability of different schedules and doses; pharmacokinetics in nasal mucosal lining fluid of the nose and nasopharynx, saliva, and serum; and ex vivo functionality. We evaluated in vivo efficacy of CR9114 in mice and nonhuman primates. Intranasal CR9114 was safe and well tolerated across all doses and schedules. The half-life of CR9114 in the nose was ~3 hours. Steady-state concentrations were rapidly attained and sustained with multidosing. Trough concentrations were up to 92-fold higher with twice-daily administration compared with once-daily administration. Pharmacokinetics of intranasal CR9114 in nonhuman primates mirrored that of humans better than mice. Postdose nasal samples potently bound hemagglutinin from diverse strains of influenza A and B viruses and, particularly at the 10-milligram dose, neutralized A/H1N1, A/H5N1, and A/H3N2 more potently than baseline samples. Twice-daily administration of CR9114 protected nonhuman primates against influenza virus challenge with the same intranasal formulation and device as used in humans, providing evidence for the efficacy of intranasal multidosing. Together, these study findings characterize the pharmacokinetics of CR9114 after intranasal administration and provide proof of concept that intranasal antibodies can elicit efficacious passive immunity against influenza viruses.",

These fungi cause severe or chronic mycoses and are typically treated with azoles or amphotericin B. Ambruticin, a polyketide antifungal, shows promise as an alternative therapy. It targets hybrid histidine kinases (HHKs), which are fungal-specific proteins essential for osmoregulation and parasitic morphology and are conserved across thermal dimorphic species. Targeting HHKs suggests that ambruticin may therapeutically treat infections from multiple fungi without causing mechanism-based toxicity. We explore ambruticin’s potential to effectively treat these fungal infections without major adverse effects.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Although the metabolic pathways that allow the utilization of one-carbon compounds as sole sources of carbon and energy (methylotrophy) are well characterized, this understanding has been substantially refined and expanded in recent years. The paradigm-shifting discovery of the lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase, XoxF, established the biological relevance of rare-earth metals and revealed that methylotrophy required reassessment. We now know that XoxF is broadly distributed among bacteria and may actually constitute an ancestral form by which methylotrophy initially evolved, as well as the predominant form in which it now exists in nature. A new study published in Applied and Environmental Microbiology (C. R. Mineo, J. Jiang, and N. C. Martinez-Gomez, 91:e01304-25, 2025, https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01304-25 ) extends this knowledge to characterize a heretofore undemonstrated methylotrophic pathway architecture among nitrogen-fixing plant symbionts of the Sinorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium genera. Their metabolic strategy proceeds via XoxF, complete oxidation to carbon dioxide, and the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle to assimilate the oxidized carbon. The authors designate this the “XoxF-CBB pathway,” which appears to be well-conserved across these groups of bacteria. Their streamlined pathway represents a unique connection between autotrophy and methylotrophy that, when paired with XoxF, could constitute an underappreciated, but prevalent, variation on methylotrophy. The study highlights the need to remain open-minded about methylotrophic pathway configurations in bacteria, as well as informing the ways in which we should consider seeking to isolate novel methylotrophs. Finally, the pathway’s presence in nodule-forming bacteria raises new questions about how methylotrophy shapes their physiology in both free-living soil conditions and plant-symbiotic associations.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Caulobacter species are common residents of soil and aquatic ecosystems, where bioavailable iron is often extremely limited. Like other diderm bacteria, Caulobacter crescentus can acquire Fe(III) via outer-membrane TonB-dependent transporters (TBDTs) that recognize and import ferric siderophore complexes. Although C. crescentus is not known to synthesize siderophores, it encodes multiple TBDTs that are transcriptionally regulated by the ferric uptake repressor (Fur), suggesting it acquires iron by scavenging xenosiderophores produced by neighboring microbes. To identify C. crescentus genes required for xenosiderophore utilization, we developed a barcoded transposon screen using ferrioxamine B (FXB), a hydroxamate-family siderophore produced by soil actinomycetes, as a model substrate. This screen identified hiuABC , a conserved, Fur-regulated operon that supports FXB-dependent iron acquisition. We provide evidence that hiuA encodes the primary TBDT responsible for uptake of ferrioxamines and ferrichrome (FC), structurally distinct members of the hydroxamate siderophore family. hiuB encodes a PepSY-domain protein with structural similarity to Pseudomonas aeruginosa FoxB, a known periplasmic ferri-siderophore reductase. hiuC encodes a small, hypothetical membrane protein predicted to form a functional complex with HiuB in the inner membrane. Both hiuB and hiuC are required for utilization of FXB and ferrioxamine E, indicating a shared role in iron acquisition from ferrioxamines. Surprisingly, utilization of FC as an iron source required hiuB but not hiuC , suggesting a substrate-specific role for HiuC in ferri-siderophore processing. We conclude that the conserved hiuABC operon encodes a set of proteins that enable bacteria to acquire iron from structurally diverse hydroxamate-family siderophores. IMPORTANCE Iron is often a limiting nutrient due to its poor solubility in the presence of oxygen. To overcome this, some microbes produce specialized molecules known as siderophores, which tightly bind and solubilize iron, facilitating its uptake into the cell. Caulobacter species are common in freshwater, marine, and soil environments, and there is emerging evidence that they play important roles in plant-associated microbial communities. Here, we report the discovery of a three-gene system that allows Caulobacter crescentus to acquire iron from a set of siderophores produced by select soil bacteria and fungi. We define functional roles for each protein component of this system, which informs a mechanism by which Caulobacter can pirate iron-scavenging molecules produced by its neighbors.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The human gastrointestinal tract is home to a diverse community of microorganisms from all domains of life, collectively referred to as the gut microbiome. While gut bacteria have been studied extensively in relation to human host health and physiology, other constituents remain underexplored. This includes the gut virome, the collection of bacteriophages, eukaryotic viruses, and other mobile genetic elements present in the intestine. Like gut bacteria, the gut virome has been causatively linked to human health and disease. However, the gut virome is substantially more difficult to characterize, given its high diversity and complexity, as well as multiple challenges related to in vitro cultivation and in silico detection and annotation. In this mini-review, we describe various methodologies for examining the gut virome using both culture-dependent and culture-independent tools. We highlight in vitro and in vivo approaches to cultivate viruses and characterize viral-bacterial host dynamics, as well as high-throughput screens to interrogate these relationships. We also outline a general workflow for identifying and characterizing uncultivated viral genomes from fecal metagenomes, along with several key considerations throughout the process. More broadly, we aim to highlight the opportunities to synergize and streamline wet- and dry-lab techniques to robustly and comprehensively interrogate the human gut virome.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Sinks contaminated with opportunistic pathogens are a source of hospital-acquired infections, responsible for morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Understanding pathogen behavior in sinks is essential for preventing their spread. Only a few studies have examined how sink environments affect pathogen distribution through changes in drain microbiota. This research uses an integrative approach to study three major bacterial pathogens: Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , and Serratia marcescens . Sink drains in two NICUs were sampled during 2-month and 5-month periods. The diversity and abundance of opportunistic pathogens were determined at the genotypic level. Their occurrence was analyzed considering microbial communities, water parameters, faucet design, and sink usage. P. aeruginosa , S. marcescens , and S. maltophilia were found in 47%, 39%, and 67% of drain samples, respectively. Low genotype diversity was observed within sinks, with 1–3 genotypes per species/sample. Dominant genotypes persisted throughout the sampling periods, showing the persistence of opportunistic pathogen strains in drains. Quantification of the studied bacterial sequence types ranged from 10 3 to 10 7 DNA copies/mL. The heterogeneous spatial distribution of the three species between individual sink drains was primarily attributed to changes in community composition, chlorine concentrations, and faucet design. We isolated a strain of Delftia tsuruhatensis (Dt1S33), whose presence in the sink environment was negatively correlated with the three opportunistic pathogens. Dt1S33 reduced the capacity of the pathogens to form biofilms in laboratory co-cultures. These findings underscore the key roles of biotic and abiotic factors in the colonization of sink drains by pathogens. IMPORTANCE Hospital sinks are critical reservoirs for opportunistic pathogens (OPs), increasing the risk of healthcare-associated infections, especially in vulnerable populations such as neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients. Our study found that 39%–67% of sink drains were persistently colonized by Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Serratia marcescens , and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia , with a limited number of genotypes dominating for months. Colonization patterns in drains varied between NICUs, mainly influenced by microbial community composition and sink design. Notably, Delftia tsuruhatensis presence was negatively correlated with OP colonization and inhibited OP biofilm formation in vitro . These results highlight the interplay of abiotic and biotic factors in sink colonization and suggest that antagonistic bacteria could help reduce pathogen persistence. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing targeted interventions to mitigate infection risks in high-risk hospital settings.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Herpes simplex virus (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) cause cutaneous and mucocutaneous lesions. Primary infection and secondary reactivations affect the mouth, genitalia, and dermis at other bodily regions. Accurate clinical diagnosis without laboratory confirmation can be difficult since lesions caused by these viruses are nondescript, and areas of bodily infection can overlap. Rapid molecular test results have been shown to reduce the time to definitive diagnosis, providing additional opportunities for patient counseling, antiviral therapy, and appropriate infection prevention measures. A molecular, multiplexed HSV + VZV assay allows both viruses to be tested simultaneously from a single lesion swab. This could potentially enhance diagnostic accuracy through laboratory confirmation, thus minimizing dependence on clinical judgment alone. The recently Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV multiplex assay has not been widely evaluated against other FDA-approved assays. This is the first report evaluating the clinical performance of the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV assay compared to independent assays for HSV and VZV. Results indicated that the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV assay was comparable to the Diasorin Simplexa HSV 1&amp;2 Direct and VZV Direct assays. IMPORTANCE Lesion-causing viruses, herpes simplex (HSV-1 and HSV-2) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV), are common and difficult to distinguish clinically. Each can be found over any area of the body but have different treatment regimens and considerations for infectivity and future outbreak management. Laboratory analysis by molecular assay is the gold standard for these viruses, but it can take hours to days and is reliant on the clinician choosing the correct virus to test the first time, or risk being outside the treatment window. A rapid molecular assay that detects all three viruses simultaneously was developed and recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Here, we provide data highlighting the clinical performance of the Savanna HSV 1+2/VZV assay and its ability to detect across anatomical locations and ages. These data indicate that the Savanna assay is comparable to individual assays for each viral target, providing the opportunity for enhanced diagnostic accuracy of lesions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Aging is a key challenge for modern society. In particular, brain aging is accompanied by chronic inflammation, depletion of energy potential, and an increased level of oxidative stress, with changes in blood composition playing a special role in this process. Recent studies also show that aging progresses non-linearly throughout life. Primates are genetically and anthropometrically the closest laboratory animals to humans, thus representing the most accurate model for research. This study establishes baseline values for biochemical parameters (including the state of the body’s antioxidant system), cellular-hematological, and genomic indicators in aging primates of various species, sexes, and ages from the Kurchatov Complex of Medical Primatology. In aging males, the concentration of lipid peroxidation products was lower than in females of the same age and species. Analysis of antioxidant defense parameters indicates a more stable redox balance in old cynomolgus macaques of both sexes, which may be associated with their lower aggressiveness and high adaptability. The biochemical profile analysis in aging rhesus macaques revealed that females exhibit elevated levels of all measured parameters. In aging cynomolgus macaques, there are fewer sex-related differences in blood composition characteristics compared to rhesus macaques. It can be noted that under the housing conditions of the primates at the nursery of the Kurchatov Complex of Medical Primatology, several types of aging based on blood parameters can be observed within the same age category across different species and sexes.",

    "Abstract": "Background Oesophageal achalasia (OA) is a rare gastrointestinal motility disorder causing significant impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Treatment focuses on symptom amelioration through interventions including laparoscopic myotomy and peroral endoscopic myotomy. We conducted a systematic review to identify the tools used to assess HRQoL in adult and paediatric patients with OA undergoing intervention, and to characterise the extent of heterogeneity in their application and reporting. Study Ovid was used to search multiple digital databases: Journals@Ovid Full Text Subset, Journals@Ovid, Ovid Medline, Embase, Ovid Emcare, HMIC Health Management Information Consortium. Initial search produced 1746 titles with 46 articles remaining after full text review. Results 43 of the 46 papers included adult cohorts with an average of 54 patients per study. Three included paediatric cohorts. 15 different tools were used to evaluate QoL with sparse use of disease-specific assessment tools suggesting these tools are not widely known or fit for purpose. Conclusions This study highlights significant heterogeneity in methods, variations in QoL tools and selective reporting of HRQoL measures. Though these tools and approaches may confer individual benefit, this heterogeneity renders direct comparison or pooling of data difficult. Additionally, many studies did not report HRQoL outcomes for preintervention and postintervention, thus impeding evaluation of treatment effectiveness across existing studies. Future direction should focus on achieving consensus around a standardised approach to QoL assessment in achalasia, which may involve the adoption, refinement or validation of an existing disease-specific tool rather than development of a new one.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Randomized trials have not shown a clear benefit of endovascular therapy (EVT) for medium vessel occlusion (MeVO) strokes. We aimed to identify subgroups in which successful recanalization provides meaningful clinical benefit. Methods We retrospectively analyzed prospectively recorded consecutive patients with MeVO stroke treated with EVT at two comprehensive stroke centers. Successful recanalization was defined as expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) 2b–3. The treatment effect was calculated as the difference in 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score 0–2) between recanalized and non-recanalized patients. Predicted infarct core on admission was calculated on non-contrast CT using AI-based software (AI-ICV; Methinks AI) and on CT perfusion (cerebral blood flow (CBF) &lt;30%; IschemiaView). The hypoperfused volume (Tmax &gt;6 s) was also obtained and the perfusion mismatch ratio was calculated (Tmax &gt;6 s – CBF &lt;30%)/Tmax &gt;6 s). The treatment effect was analyzed in the overall cohort and after applying enrichment strategies based on clinical and imaging variables. Optimal cutoffs were identified by maximizing the added treatment effect while retaining ≥40% of the cohort. Results Among 232 EVT-treated patients (mean age 76.1±12.3 years; median (IQR) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 9 (6–14)), the recanalization rate was 84.9%. The overall treatment effect was +33.3% (recanalized 53.3% vs non-recanalized 20.0%). Enrichment strategies increased the treatment effect: age ≤80 years (+13.8%), AI-ICV ≤9 mL (+9.9%), and NIHSS score ≥10 (+6.7%). Combining age, NIHSS, and AI-ICV criteria increased the treatment effect to 61.9% for an added value of +33.6%. Conclusions In MeVO stroke, the benefit of successful recanalization is substantial and can be further enhanced through pragmatic enrichment using readily available clinical and imaging variables, supporting refined patient selection and future trial design focused on enriched subgroups.",

    "Abstract": "Background Substance use among surgical patients is common and correlated with greater postoperative opioid use. However, the association of preoperative substance use on postoperative pain is unknown. In this context, a brief, validated tool such as the Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other Substance use (TAPS) Questionnaire could provide valuable information to assess the risk of poor postoperative pain control. Methods We prospectively identified adults aged 18 years and older undergoing common surgical procedures between December 2018 and July 2023 across three institutions. Patients completed the TAPS measure prior to surgery. A positive TAPS screen was defined as tobacco use ≥monthly, heavy alcohol use ≥monthly, any use of recreational drugs, or any use of prescription medication not as prescribed. The primary outcome was ‘worst’ overall pain (on a scale of 0–10, 0=no pain, 10=worst pain imaginable) at three time points: prior to surgery, 2 weeks postoperatively, and 1 month postoperatively. Mixed linear models were used to determine the association between TAPS Score and pain over time, adjusting for patient factors. Results In this cohort of 4410 individuals, 42.2% reported unhealthy substance use using TAPS in the 12 months prior to surgery. After adjusting for patient factors, participants who screened positively on TAPS reported higher worst overall pain scores than those with negative TAPS screens at baseline (3.51 vs 3.15, p&lt;0.001) and at 1 month postoperatively (2.66 vs 2.41, p=0.036). No significant difference was observed at 2 weeks after surgery. Conclusions Preoperative substance use is common and is correlated with higher levels of patient-reported pain after surgery, but within minimal clinically important differences. These findings are preliminary and require confirmation. Risky substance use has an important impact on postoperative recovery, and the perioperative window provides an opportunity to assess and intervene in unhealthy substance use.",

    "Abstract": "Background The perioperative use of methadone is increasing because of its favorable effects on postoperative analgesia and opioid consumption. Methadone can cause QTc interval prolongation, increasing the risk of Torsades de Pointes. The effect of an intraoperative loading dose of methadone on intraoperative QTc interval prolongation is unknown. Methods A retrospective observational cohort study of patients aged ≥18 years who underwent major non-cardiopulmonary surgery was conducted. Patients receiving an intraoperative loading dose of methadone were assigned to the methadone group; others formed the non-methadone group. Single-lead ECGs (II) were analyzed using a wavelet-based QTc interval algorithm to obtain 1- min average QTc interval values at baseline and intraoperatively. The outcome measure was the occurrence of any intraoperative 1- min averaged time windows that exceeded the predefined thresholds of 500 ms (primary), increase of ≥30 ms from baseline and increase of ≥60 ms from baseline (secondary). Propensity score matching was performed. Results A total of 637 patients were included, and after propensity score matching (1:1 ratio), 244 patients were analyzed. A QTc interval &gt;500 ms (23.8% vs 23.0%; p=0.88), an increase of ≥30 ms from baseline (67.8% vs 75.0%; p=0.22), and an increase of ≥60 ms from baseline (29.7% vs 22.4%; p=0.21) occurred equally in the non-methadone group compared with the methadone group. The percentage of intraoperative time spent above threshold was significantly higher in the non-methadone group for the&gt;500 ms threshold (p=0.004). Conclusion The implementation of methadone for perioperative pain management was not associated with an increased incidence of intraoperative QTc interval prolongation.",

    "Abstract": "The construction industry has faced stagnant productivity and a high fatality rate among workers. To address these issues, robotization has been implemented, particularly through physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC), where robots perform physically demanding tasks in collaboration with workers in shared workspaces. However, inefficient motion information exchange between robots and workers can lead to collisions and safety risks. To address this concern, this study proposes a pose-aware human-robot collaboration method. This approach develops a 3D pose estimation deep network to analyze workers' postures. Based on this motion data, the method refines the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree path-planning algorithm, enabling robots to generate collision-free paths. A material-delivering task was employed to evaluate the method. The results reported that the proposed method allows robots to make safe adjustments based on workers' motion with an 86.5% success rate. The findings support the development of safe and reliable pHRC solutions, enhancing robotics implementation in construction.",

Integrating expert insights (Delphi survey and focus groups) with FCM analysis, this study reveals unprecedented insights into systemic safety behavior. Key findings include quantifying multi-directional interdependencies, elucidating complex indirect causal pathways and critical feedback loops, and identifying dynamic leverage points. The model further enables nuanced intervention prioritization by demonstrating how the collective interplay of factors drives system-wide safety outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Abstract We present a computational method to automatically design the n -qubit realisations of quantum algorithms. Our approach leverages a domain-specific language (DSL) that enables the construction of quantum circuits via modular building blocks, making it well-suited for evolutionary search. In this DSL quantum circuits are abstracted beyond the usual gate-sequence description and scale automatically to any problem size. This enables us to learn the algorithm structure rather than a specific unitary implementation. We demonstrate our method by automatically designing three known quantum algorithms—the Quantum Fourier Transform, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, and Grover’s search. Remarkably, we were able to learn the general implementation of each algorithm by considering examples of circuits containing at most 5-qubits. Our method proves robust, as it maintains performance across increasingly large search spaces. Convergence to the relevant algorithm is achieved with high probability and with moderate computational resources.",

    "Abstract": "This work focuses on the [Formula: see text]-dimensional Korteweg-de Vries–Calogero–Bogoyavlenskii–Schiff equation, analyzed through the recently introduced bilinear neural network method. By implementing multiple neural network architectures with both single- and double-hidden layers (5-2-1, 5-3-1, 5-4-1, 5-2-4-1, and 5-3-4-1) in combination with diverse activation functions, a wide class of analytical solutions is derived. The obtained results are illustrated using three-dimensional surface plots alongside their two-dimensional density profiles, highlighting a spectrum of nonlinear wave phenomena such as bell-shaped waves, kink-antikink interactions, rogue waves, breather-type patterns, and lump structures. The findings confirm that the bilinear neural network method offers an effective and robust computational strategy for addressing higher-dimensional nonlinear evolution equations.",

    "Abstract": "The non-Newtonian fluid plays a crucial part in a wide range of uses, likely optimizing cooling technologies in electronic devices, improving drug delivery systems, and enhancing thermal management in reactors. However, the flow over the conducting Riga plate is used in controlling thermal and concentration boundary layers, which offers potential improvements in energy efficiency. The primary objective of the proposed analysis is to examine the radiative time-dependent buoyancy-driven Casson fluid across an electrically conducting slanted Riga plate, considering the impacts of a heat source and variable suction. For the thermal and solute transport phenomena, the effect of heat dissipation, thermal radiation, and chemical reaction is considered. The utilization of suitable dimensionless quantities plays a role in converting the governing equations into a set of partial differential equations in non-dimensional form. Further, these are numerically solved by utilizing the Finite Element Method in the Galerkin Weighted Residual Approach (FEM-GWRA) with linear interpolation functions. The variation of several characterizing parameters is presented through graphs. The significant outcomes include the Casson parameter and titled angle controls momentum boundary layer, while thermal diffusion and mass diffusion contribute to the mass and energy boundary layer thickness accordingly. However, the important findings are that the non-Newtonian Casson parameter manifests in two ways on the velocity distribution, and it favors a significant hike in the speed of the fluid close to the surface, but when the domain grows, the profile attenuates significantly. More precisely, the heavier species, along with the reacting parameter, act as a controlling parameter in restricting the fluid concentration. The validation of the current outcomes is also disclosed in good correlation in comparison with earlier investigations.",

    "Abstract": "Thyroid nodules are a common endocrine disorder, and accurate imaging diagnosis plays a crucial role in differentiating benign from malignant lesions. However, conventional image analysis often depends on manual annotations and physicians’ subjective experience, leading to inconsistency and variability in diagnostic outcomes. To address these challenges, this study proposes RSA-UNet, an automated segmentation model for thyroid nodule ultrasound images. The proposed architecture builds upon the U-Net framework. It integrates three key components: a ResNet50 encoder to enhance feature extraction through residual learning, a Spatial Channel Block Attention Module (SCBAM) to strengthen the network’s focus on salient features, and an Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to capture multi-scale global contextual information. Experimental results demonstrate that RSA-UNet achieves superior segmentation performance, with an accuracy of 96.45%, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 85.55%, and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 91.87%, outperforming various U-Net variants. These results highlight the model’s effectiveness and its potential for clinical application in the automated assessment of thyroid nodules.",

    "Abstract": "Association rule mining (ARM) is a fundamental technique in knowledge discovery and intelligent decision analysis, yet traditional algorithms such as Apriori and FP-Growth suffer from exponential candidate growth, high memory usage, and poor adaptability in dynamic environments. Metaheuristic and swarm intelligence algorithms have recently emerged as promising alternatives, but most existing methods still face two limitations: insufficient balance between global exploration and local exploitation, and low robustness when data are noisy or evolving. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-strategy enhanced hybrid Salp Swarm Algorithm (Hybrid SSA) for association rule mining. The proposed framework integrates four complementary strategies: Latin hypercube initialization to improve population diversity, Lévy flight perturbations to strengthen global search, adaptive parameter control to dynamically adjust exploration and exploitation, and elite retention to preserve high-quality rules. This combination enables Hybrid SSA to maintain scalability, robustness, and interpretability under large-scale and time-varying conditions. We provide theoretical analysis establishing convergence and diversity guarantees, and validate the method through comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets (Retail, Mushroom, and Telecom). Results demonstrate that Hybrid SSA significantly outperforms Apriori, FP-Growth, and genetic algorithm baselines in terms of rule quality (lift and confidence), convergence speed, and robustness under noisy environments. The contributions of this work are threefold: (1) designing a hybrid SSA framework unifying multiple enhancement strategies; (2) providing theoretical and empirical evidence of improved convergence and resilience; and (3) demonstrating superior performance in real-world decision analysis tasks, confirming the potential of Hybrid SSA for scalable and adaptive association rule mining.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate load decomposition and behavior pattern recognition are critical for efficient energy management and personalized demand response in modern smart grids. However, existing methods often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies in electricity consumption data and rely heavily on manual feature engineering, limiting their accuracy and adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes BLIP, a novel BiGRU-based framework for load decomposition and electricity consumption behavior pattern recognition. By leveraging the bidirectional temporal modeling capability of BiGRU networks, BLIP accurately decomposes aggregated load signals into distinct components, capturing both past and future dependencies. The framework further exploits the decomposed load features to recognize personalized electricity consumption patterns, enabling fine-grained differentiation of user or device behaviors. Unlike traditional approaches, BLIP performs end-to-end learning, improving robustness and generalization in complex power system environments. BLIP incorporates a unique adaptation to the BiGRU architecture, enabling better handling of irregular load fluctuations and introducing a novel attention mechanism for enhanced behavior pattern recognition. This adaptation is particularly effective in addressing challenges like inaccurate peak load forecasting and excessive energy consumption, which are common in smart grid systems. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that BLIP significantly enhances both load disaggregation accuracy and behavioral pattern identification, supporting more intelligent and efficient energy management.",

    "Abstract": "The accumulation of massive amounts of student learning data has provided a solid foundation for predicting academic performance, while also presenting new opportunities for personalized teaching and optimizing teaching resources. It is worth noting that a small number of outlier data points exist within educational data. These data points are difficult to analyse through the mining of latent patterns, and they do not easily capture the dynamic changes in student performance. However, these outlier data points play an indispensable role in the formulation of personalized teaching strategies for students. Traditional machine learning methods have limitations in handling issues related to concentrated performance data distribution and insufficient prediction accuracy for outliers. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) prediction model (BFE-LSTM) enhanced by binning feature engineering. By integrating binning encoding techniques with time-series feature analysis, the model significantly improves prediction accuracy and robustness. Empirical studies demonstrate that, while reducing model complexity, the proposed model optimizes its modelling capability for long tail distributed data, thereby significantly enhancing the prediction accuracy of outliers. Experimental results show that the R 2 value of BFE-LSTM model is 0.9471. Compared with the designed baseline LSTM model, the MSE is reduced to 95.1%, the MAE is improved to 94.6%, and the outlier correction error reaches 100%. At the same time, there is no additional burden on computing efficiency. This study provides an efficient and lightweight prediction framework for educational data mining, achieving breakthroughs in feature interpretability, computational efficiency, and model generalization ability, and offering a new methodological support for precise learning situation analysis.",

    "Abstract": "This study presents a data-driven framework that integrates machine-learning-based diagnosis with gradient-based optimization for lightning protection of transmission corridors. Six standardized features — ground resistance, insulator-string length, tower height, protection angle, ground inclination, and ground-flash density—are normalized to construct tower state vectors for model training and inference. The diagnostic model outputs risk scores and cause attributions, identifying ground-flash density as the dominant hazard (27.9%), followed by excessive ground inclination, increased tower height, and shortened insulator strings that elevate wrap-around strike risk. Using these diagnostic results, a gradient-based optimizer minimizes state deviations within engineering constraints to generate actionable protection measures, including arrester configuration and parameter adjustments. In a 220-kV case study covering 39 towers, 30 satisfied the standard and 9 were recommended for arrester installation; for the high-risk Tower #034, the trip-out rate decreased to 1.632 times/(100 km·a). The proposed approach improves objectivity and efficiency relative to manual practice. Future work will incorporate cost weighting to enhance practical deployment.",

    "Abstract": "Underwater object detection plays a crucial role in marine resource exploration and ecological conservation. However, it suffers from significant challenges due to severe image blurring and low contrast, which substantially degrade the detection performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose DAF-DETR, a novel Detection Transformer framework with Dual Attention and Dual Fusion modules. DAF-DETR first introduces an Aggregated Attention Mechanism to enhance the ResNet residual blocks, which boosts both global context awareness and local detail extraction in the backbone network. Second, it incorporates a Deformable Attention-based Feature Interaction (DAFI) module to improve the discriminability between object and background features in low-contrast underwater images. Finally, a Dual Fusion Module (DFM), which integrates Global-to-Local Spatial Aggregation (GLSA) with Haar Wavelet-based Downsampling (HWD), is employed to effectively alleviate the adverse effects of severe underwater blurring. Extensive experiments on the DUO and UODD datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed DAF-DETR framework, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.",

    "Abstract": "The pattern recognition revolution in Medical Imaging (MI) has helped several fields, including dental diagnostics. Combining Organizational Analytics and Performance Management (OAPM) systems with neural networks has been recognized as a promising research field. The aim of this research is to identify whether the technologies mentioned above can improve and expedite oral healthcare diagnostics. Regarding dental image analysis, Neural Networks (NN) are perfect for detecting cavities, periodontal diseases, and tooth morphological abnormalities because they can learn complex patterns from data. This paper suggests a new design to address the underutilization of OAPM systems, Convolutional NN (CNNs), and Recurrent NN (RNNs) in ML. When it comes to quality control and performance monitoring, dental clinics can rely on the OAPM system. It offers a structured method for handling and evaluating data streams. Convolutional neural networks are capable of segmenting and classifying intraoral and dental radiographs. Because of its ability to mimic temporal interactions, RNNs are perfect for tracking the efficacy of treatments or the progression of diseases. A revolutionary network design would be one that can learn from each patient's specific inputs and characteristics. Diagnostics and care coordination for patients are both enhanced by the state-of-the-art data analytics provided by the OAPM system. Using operational analytics, performance management software, and modern neural networks, dental diagnostic imaging has been transformed. Integrating data from several modalities and using AI-driven decision support systems to provide comprehensive dental treatment is a potential direction for future healthcare research.",

To address this, we propose CAME(Cross-Attentive Multimodal Enhancement for Weakly-Supervised Referring Image Semantic Segmentation).

A Positional Encoding 2D(PED) module enhances structural perception through coordinate encoding. Structure-Aware Consistency Loss(SACL) enforces boundary alignment via edge constraints. Additionally, Entropy Constraint Loss and Focal Loss V2 suppress low-confidence noise and emphasize difficult regions. This joint optimization improves pseudo mask quality, resulting in sharper boundaries and enhanced regional consistency. Experiments show that CAME achieves mIoU scores of 54.96%, 57.08%, and 53.01% on the validation and test sets of RefCOCO, 48.25%, 46.37%, and 45.09% on RefCOCO+, and 54.89% on the validation set of RefCOCOg, significantly outperforming existing weakly supervised methods.

However, training ViTs from scratch on small datasets without large-scale pretraining remains challenging. In this paper, we investigate the evolution of the Empirical Spectral Density (ESD) of ViTs during training and propose a regularization method based on the singular value spectrum. Specifically, we analyze how the implicit self-regularization of ESD of weights affects the feature space mapped by the weights, particularly the phenomenon of limited feature diversity under a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We then introduce an explicit regularization approach that jointly optimizes the Singular Value Entropy (SVE) and the spectral norm of the weight matrices, aiming to enhance both the feature SNR and diversity during pretraining. Experiments on multiple small datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of ViTs and their variants in training from scratch scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "NR-IQA aims at assessing the perceptual quality of images based on human subjective perception. However, existing NR-IQA methods are likely to miss important fine-grained texture and structural information of key targets, and thus cannot provide reliable quality scores for UAV-captured images in complex power grid inspection scenes. In practical power grid inspection, images are typically captured at high resolutions (e.g., 4K or above) under varying illumination and weather conditions, while quality assessment is required to be performed with low latency on edge or ground-based computing platforms to support downstream inspection tasks. To address these challenges, we propose MASC-IQA, a no-reference image quality assessment model designed for complex background environments. Firstly, we train a Feature Contrastive Module (FCM) on a large-scale real dataset to learn distortion types and degradation levels through supervised contrastive learning, enabling robust distortion-aware feature representation without relying on subjective image ratings during inference. Secondly, we introduce a Multi-Channel Attention Module (MCAM) to explicitly model inter-channel dependencies and enhance the interaction between global context and local structural details, which is particularly important for preserving perceptually critical information in cluttered industrial scenes. In addition, we release GridVision, a dedicated dataset for NR-IQA in power grid inspection scenarios, consisting of UAV-captured images with realistic distortions annotated by domain experts. Experimental results on several public IQA benchmarks and GridVision demonstrate that MASC-IQA consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and robustness.",

    "Abstract": "Facing complex geological conditions, the acquired seismic data are often seriously contaminated by noise. How to recover seismic signals in a strong noise background remains a challenging issue. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Cascaded Multi-Scale (LCMS) network for seismic data denoising, which efficiently and effectively mines seismic signals from low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) data while reducing computational costs. The network comprises a series of LCMS residual blocks to fully explore the multi-scale dense features of seismic data, in which each layer directly accesses the features of all previous layers to implement a continuous memory mechanism, not only enhancing feature utilization but also reducing the redundant computations. The architecture of network is optimized to achieve a compact structure, ensuring that it requires fewer parameters and computational resources compared to traditional deep networks, thus enabling faster processing without sacrificing performance. Furthermore, high-frequency information mainly presents seismic reflection details, and the lack of high frequencies affects the bandwidth of seismic data. To this end, we employ the non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST) to acquire high-frequency prior information and integrate it into the network, which guides the network to focus more on the learning of high-frequency features. The qualitative and quantitative performance evaluations are conducted on synthetic data and real seismic data. Compared with the SOTA methods, our method achieves higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values and fewer parameters. When applied to real seismic data, our method efficiently recovers more effective signals of seismic data.",

    "Abstract": "The identification of emotional states through physiological signals is vital in human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and management. In contrast to existing models, which use either a combination of visual and Electroencephalogram (EEG) features or individual features, the present study introduces a hybrid multimodal machine learning framework that fuses EEG and ECG (Electrocardiogram) features for emotion classification. The EEG indeed captures the brain's neural activity associated with emotional states, while the ECG monitors the heart's electrical signals, reflecting autonomic responses that are highly responsive to emotional fluctuations. Integrating these physiological signals enhances the representation of emotional states by capturing complementary information from both the cortical and autonomic nervous systems. To exploit this observation, we explore the combination of a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. This work considers four distinct emotion levels based on valence and arousal dimensions.

    "Abstract": "The rapid growth of data in various domains has made entity semantic retrieval and reasoning increasingly crucial. Traditional retrieval methods often fail to capture the complex relationships and contextual nuances between entities, especially in cases involving polysemy, synonymy, and context-dependent meanings. These methods typically rely on surface-level lexical features, which are inadequate for understanding the deeper semantic relationships between entities. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative approach that integrates knowledge graphs (KGs) with deep learning models for entity semantic retrieval and reasoning. This combination is essential because knowledge graphs provide structured, rich semantic information that explicitly defines relationships between entities, while deep learning models excel at processing unstructured data and understanding context through layers of abstraction. Together, these two approaches address complementary aspects of entity retrieval: KGs provide a foundation of semantic knowledge and relationships, while deep learning models enhance contextual understanding and the ability to handle ambiguity, such as polysemy and synonymy. The proposed KGI-ERR algorithm leverages the rich semantic structure of KGs to enhance entity matching, contextual understanding, and relationship-based reasoning. By incorporating graph-based attention mechanisms and entity linking, our approach improves the accuracy of retrieval results and the depth of inferences, enabling more intelligent and context-aware decision-making. Experimental results show that KGI-ERR significantly outperforms traditional retrieval systems in terms of retrieval accuracy and reasoning efficiency, especially in complex, multi-relational datasets. This method provides a powerful tool for applications in natural language processing, information retrieval, and intelligent decision-making systems.",

    "Abstract": "With the rapid development of digital-intelligence service platforms, web-based applications are increasingly required to provide real-time and reliable AI-driven services under diverse and dynamic workloads. However, the coexistence of multiple heterogeneous models and the variability of user requests pose critical challenges for efficient model scheduling and inference optimization. To address these issues, we propose MAIS (Multi-model Adaptive Inference Scheduling), a unified framework that integrates workload-aware multi-model scheduling with adaptive inference strategies. Specifically, MAIS dynamically allocates computational resources and selects appropriate inference modes by jointly considering user latency requirements, platform resource availability, and model complexity. Its core innovation lies in combining these factors in a unified optimization framework while also supporting hierarchical inference optimization, which allows dynamic adaptation to varying workloads and model heterogeneity. Furthermore, it supports hierarchical inference optimization through model compression, selective execution, and edge-cloud collaboration, achieving a balance between accuracy, efficiency, and service quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAIS significantly improves response latency, resource utilization, and service robustness compared to existing scheduling and inference methods, making it well-suited for next-generation digital-intelligence service platforms.",

    "Abstract": "The core of font generation technology lies in preserving character structure and accurately transferring stylistic features. While extensive research has been conducted on Chinese character generation, studies on Yi script font generation remain in their infancy. This paper, therefore, propose a framework that employs a multi-scale conditional diffusion model to generate Yi script fonts. A Multi-scale Content Perception (MCP) module is designed. This module employs a constructed channel-space dual-domain multi-scale attention coordination mechanism to hierarchically capture multi-scale spatial and content information of characters within images. To achieve cross-modal feature fusion for Yi characters, an Efficient Style Insertion (ESI) module was developed. This module employs a cross-attention mechanism integrating multi-head mechanisms and efficient channel attention to enable cross-modal interaction of font style features. It further introduces block-wise attention to overcome computational redundancy issues inherent in traditional cross-attention. Finally, comparative experiments across Yi font datasets—including the public standardized Yi font file (PSFF-Yi) dataset, Self-Built Handwritten Yi (SBHW-Yi) dataset, and Ancient Manuscript Handwritten Yi (AMHW-Yi) dataset—demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.",

    "Abstract": "The fault of the power grid transmission line itself or the foreign matter caught in it will pose a potential threat to the power system. Efficient anomaly detection is the key to maintain the stability of modern transmission systems. At present, the increasing demand for edge computing equipment makes it a trend to develop lightweight and efficient power grid anomaly detection methods. To deal with the practical demands of power grid anomaly detection, this paper brings the LPGANet, a lightweight model designed to achieve high accuracy while enhancing detection efficiency. The model is integrated with dynamic snake convolution (DSConv) and spatial-channel reconstruction convolution (SCConv) to increase multi-scale feature extraction and fusion and cut computational cost. In addition, An EMA method is adopted to enhance the concentration on foreground and reduce the impact of background. We release a new dataset containing 6,200 images of typical power grid anomalies such as broken strands, scattered strands, and other floating suspensions. The experimental results on the dataset demonstrate that LPGANet achieves the best accuracy, highest efficiency, and best comprehensive performance compared with other object detection methods. In addition, the effectiveness of the system under computational resource limitation is also verified in the deployment on Jetson AGX Orin edge devices.",

    "Abstract": "Bone remodeling is a tightly regulated process influenced by various cellular mechanisms, including circadian rhythm and autophagy. Circadian rhythm governs multiple physiological processes, including bone remodeling, by modulating key signaling pathways. Similarly, autophagy plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular homeostasis and regulating bone turnover. In this study, we constructed a biological regulatory network to investigate the cross-talk between circadian rhythm and autophagy in bone remodeling. Then, a verified set of parameters was obtained through model checking by modeling biological observations in Computational Tree Logic(CTL). Based on the Biological Regulatory Network(BRN) and the deduced set of parameters, a qualitative model was developed in the GINsim tool. The analysis of the qualitative model shows the cyclic behavior of the circadian rhythm, which does not have a stable state. This model was then exported to Hybrid Petri Net (HPN) for quantitative simulation to investigate the cross-talk between circadian rhythm and autophagy in bone remodeling. The results show that in a normal sleep/wake cycle, Per/Cry and Reverb inhibits osteoclast differentiation, whereas Clock/Bmal inhibits osteoblast differentiation. Moreover, the simulation results predict that dysregulation of Per/Cry, Reverb, Clock/Bmal due to shift work or sleep restriction, changes the expression level of Atgs and Rankl that may lead to bone related disorders. Thus, maintaining a normal circadian rhythm is crucial for bone homeostasis. Furthermore, our results show that Rankl is up-regulated during daytime and down-regulated in night. On contrary Atgs are up-regulated at night and down-regulated in the daytime, so time is crucial factor while considering therapeutic targets. We validated these simulation results on real-time data using statistical z-tests and multiple linear regression, whose outcomes align with the simulation results. In conclusion, this study suggests that factors influencing circadian rhythm, such as adequate sleep, regular sunlight exposure, and balanced diet, play a crucial role in supporting bone homeostasis and are particularly beneficial for patients suffering from osteoporosis.",

A rigorous analysis combining mathematical modeling and empirical evaluation reveals that these fractal networks possess emergent scale-free and small-world properties, which are essential for conferring robustness and efficient information flow. Our findings provide valuable insights into the dynamics of complex systems and lay the groundwork for understanding and designing more efficient network-based systems in socioeconomic and biological contexts.

This paper focuses on examining control problems within a finite time interval, aiming to identify a control function that steers the system's solution from a specified initial state to a targeted final state. For linear systems, the study establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for controllability by utilizing the Grammian matrix techniques. For nonlinear systems, the existence of a solution is ensured through an iterative technique, with completeness of the space guaranteed. With the help of this technique, we establish the sufficient conditions for the controllability of time-varying nonlinear fractional dynamical systems. The results show that the controllability of fractional dynamical systems can be effectively analyzed with the given framework, along with numerical simulations and graphical representations to clarify the theoretical findings.",

    "Abstract": "This article investigates heat and mass transfer phenomena by assessing advanced thermal conductivity models (TCMs) that significantly influence the flow of metallic (Au) nanoparticles under suitable boundary conditions. By integrating high TCMs with innovative interfacial fractal theory, we demonstrate a marked enhancement in thermal and concentration transfer. The analysis further investigates the physical model of a hybrid porous channel under the influence of nanofluid flow, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), and chemical reactions. A detailed numerical investigation of nonlinear partial differential equations, converted into higher-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using similarity transformations, reveals results by employing single-phase models of nanofluids. The ODEs are solved numerically via the shooting approach combined with the 4th-order Runge-Kutta method, using Mathematica to produce both graphical and numerical results. A comparative graph for expanding/contracting cases deliberated under the impact of MHD and chemical reaction. For expanding and suction cases, volume fractions of nanoparticles increase the function of the Nusselt number. Similarly, MHD is also an increasing function of shear stress near the porous surfaces. As the radius of the nanoparticle (d p ) and the inter-particle spacing (h) increases, the radial velocity and temperature profiles also rise in both porous walls. It shows that chemical reactions alter thermal and mass transfer characteristics, with optimal parameters identified for maximizing efficiency. The research uncovers nonlinear interactions between flow dynamics and nanoparticle characteristics, explores the impact of external magnetic fields, and examines how boundary conditions influence transfer processes. Overall, this work enhances our understanding of using fractal theory to improve heat and mass transfer in engineering applications involving metallic nanoparticles.",

It further studies the bifurcation structure of the reduced system to explain the existence of solitary and kink wave solutions for the governing model. Numerical simulations also show how the fractional derivative order and dispersion parameters affect the solutions that were found. Compared to previous studies that solely examined classical models, this study provides a novel conformable fractional analysis, which increases its use in wave propagation and nonlinear optics.

Furthermore, we show the influence of fractional derivative dynamics and cancer stem cells on tumor growth, as the fractional derivative enriches our knowledge of the complex underlying mechanisms of tumor progression that in turn have consequences for the determination of targeted therapies.

Contrary to most workers in the field, we perform a wider analysis by considering the MZI unbalanced and two internal phase shifts. We discuss the theoretical best-case phase sensitivity of this setup via the quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB) and we consider scenarios having - or not - access to an external phase reference. We also assess the realistic performance of the OPA-enhanced MZI by employing a balanced homodyne detection (asymmetric and symmetric phase shifts) scheme and a difference intensity detection scheme. We are thus able to find the optimum beam splitter (BS) transmissivity (transmission coefficient) of the first BS via the quantum Fisher information (QFI), while for the second one, we need to take the detection scheme into account. We are able to find these optimal values for all considered scenarios and thus assess the best-case phase sensitivity provided by this setup.",

    "Abstract": "We introduce Present Quantum Gravity (PQG), a novel framework grounded in an informational ontology in which only the present instant exists. The Present is described as a quantum memory updating in discrete ticks, encoding entanglement as closed loop structures in a Wick-rotated, relational space. Building on time-symmetric quantum mechanics, holographic principles, and entropic gravity, rest mass is reinterpreted as information hidden through temporal entanglement, and gravity emerges from a local symmetry breaking of spatial entanglement to compensate for hidden information. From this informational asymmetry, we recover the Newtonian potential and weak-field gravitational time dilations, interpreted as reductions in accessible degrees of freedom. PQG is conceptually compatible with established interpretations, while providing predictions that are in principle falsifiable. Limitations, such as the absence of a field theoretic dynamics or the full Einstein equations, and research avenues, including connections to Einstein-Cartan theory, are discussed at the end of the paper. This work synthesizes the status of the framework as presented at Quantum2025 (Torino, IT), emphasizing its conceptual advances, experimental proposals, and roadmap towards a fully dynamical theory, while leaving the details to the referenced literature.",

    "Abstract": "We propose an adaptive quantum routing protocol designed for dynamic network topologies in which link fidelity and availability vary stochastically over time. By introducing a novel Link Stability Metric that integrates predictive fidelity estimation with historical reliability analysis, the protocol can make real-time routing decisions that balance communication quality, latency, and quantum resource consumption. The routing problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process and solved using a deep reinforcement learning (RL) framework, enabling intelligent entanglement path selection and adaptive switching in response to channel degradation. We derive a fundamental bound on achievable end-to-end fidelity in dynamic quantum networks and provide convergence guarantees for the learning-based policy. Extensive simulations on scale-free and random geometric networks demonstrate significant improvements in success probability, fidelity, and latency compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, validating the theoretical analysis and showing the potential of adaptive learning approaches for robust, scalable quantum internetworking.",

    "Abstract": "Metal phthalocyanines offer a wide variety of chemical modifications that can be exploited to tailor the material properties to target different applications. This work demonstrates the electrochemical and optical fine-tuning of silicon phthalocyanine (SiPc) derivatives by introducing axial asymmetry. When integrated into organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) as organic semiconductors, the studied asymmetric derivatives exhibit modest p-type performance relative to symmetrical analogs. The highest-performing derivative, an asymmetrical fluorinated SiPc, also demonstrated ambipolarity, with performance similar to its fluorinated symmetrical counterpart. Owing to the presence of terminal alkynes on the axial handles, further chemical modifications were performed via click chemistry to demonstrate the possibility of chemical tuning post-SiPc synthesis. The success of the click reaction suggests that these derivatives can be applied in the future, for example, to attach them to polymers, to surface-graft OTFTs, and other applications.",

    "Abstract": "While the deluxe balancing domain decomposition by constraints (deluxe BDDC) preconditioner has shown effectiveness in large-scale simulations of flexible multibody systems, its current formulation does not fully utilize local Schur complement information in the treatment of primal (coarse) variables, which may affect convergence behavior in the presence of material heterogeneity. To address this issue, this work proposes a weighted Schur complement averaged BDDC preconditioner. The key innovation lies in applying a weighted average of local Schur complements not only in constructing the scaling operator, but also in forming the primal block via the Schur complement with respect to dual variables. Theoretical analysis confirms that the condition number of the preconditioned system remains uniformly bounded. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improved scalability, quasi-optimality, and robustness to material coefficient variations compared to the deluxe BDDC preconditioner. Application to the deployment dynamics of a rectangular solar array further illustrates its effectiveness and computational efficiency. This study contributes to the theoretical foundation for the parallel simulation of flexible multibody systems.",

    "Abstract": "The steel lining is a critical structural component in high-pressure tunnels, serving not only as a sealing barrier but also as a load-bearing element that resists a portion of the internal pressure. Its mechanical performance directly influences the operational safety of the tunnel. However, under conditions such as weak surrounding rock, conventional sealing designs based on elastic assumptions often require excessively large lining thicknesses, leading to increased construction costs and an underutilization of the load-bearing capacity of the surrounding rock. To address these limitations, this study introduces a controlled-yielding design of the steel lining. An elastoplastic analytical solution that incorporates the yielding behavior of the steel lining and its interaction with the surrounding rock is developed, enabling a systematic characterization of their mechanical responses during the plastic stage. The results demonstrate that the controlled-yielding design exhibits pronounced advantages under weak surrounding rock conditions, allowing a substantial increase in the ultimate internal pressure capacity of the cavern without increasing the lining thickness. Moreover, under a given internal pressure, the controlled-yielding design can markedly reduce the required thickness of the steel lining. After the steel lining yields, the contact pressure pi becomes constant as it is governed by the yielding criterion, meaning that the lining’s load-bearing contribution no longer increases even when the surrounding rock becomes weaker. Consequently, the load-sharing ratio of the surrounding rock increases significantly under weak rock conditions, allowing its bearing capacity to be fully mobilized. Overall, the proposed controlled-yielding design of the steel lining provides a new perspective for structural optimization in high-pressure tunnels. It not only enhances the ultimate internal pressure and improves the load-bearing ratio of the surrounding rock, but also reduces the required lining thickness and lowers construction costs, demonstrating substantial engineering applicability.",

    "Abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising capabilities for assisting individuals with blindness and low vision (BLV), but their effectiveness is compromised when processing BLV-captured images, which typically suffer from three fundamental challenges: quality degradation, object incompleteness, and spatial misalignment. This paper presents MPVCD (Multi-Perspective Visual Contrastive Decoding), a novel framework that addresses these challenges through visual contrastive decoding techniques. MPVCD implements three specialized perspectives: Noise Contrastive Decoding addresses quality issues by comparing predictions between original and noise-injected images; Retrieval Contrastive Decoding tackles object incompleteness by retrieving semantically similar images from a memory bank; and Focus Contrastive Decoding resolves spatial misalignment by focusing on detected object regions. These perspectives are dynamically balanced through an Adaptive Perspective Integration that optimizes token selection based on prediction confidence. Our comprehensive experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate MPVCD’s effectiveness in reducing hallucinations under varied scenarios. By generating more accurate and reliable visual descriptions, MPVCD represents a significant advancement toward assistive technologies that BLV users can confidently rely on for environmental understanding and decision-making.",

    "Abstract": "In software ecosystems (SECO), requirements management requires the collaboration of multiple actors (end-users and external developers). Thus, it is essential to consider social and human factors (SHF) when performing requirements management activities in SECO. This research aims to identify which SHF influence requirements management activities in SECO through a rapid review (RR) and semi-structured interviews with professionals who work in requirements management activities in SECO. Our findings elucidate the SHF that influences requirements management in SECO, as well as the contextual characteristics that impact these factors. We also identify strategies employed by professionals to improve SHF and the barriers that stand in their way. Finally, we describe coping mechanisms that professionals use when SHF factors cannot be sufficiently improved. Our findings lead to the construction of an actionable framework for understanding and improving SHF in requirements management activities at SECO. We evaluated the framework through a focus group comprising subject-matter experts, resulting in the final version of the framework, titled SHFiRM-SECO. A feasibility study was then conducted to assess the practical applicability of SHFiRM-SECO. The study involved professionals performing requirements management activities and confirmed the framework’s usefulness and ease of use to enhance efficiency in managing SHF within SECO. The framework serves as a go-to reference for requirements professionals and key organizations that aim to enhance productivity and effectiveness in requirements management within SECO. They will also support researchers in refining and instantiating our framework in the future.",

    "Abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of glucose intolerance that develops during pregnancy, affecting approximately 14% of pregnancies worldwide. GDM leads to an excess supply of nutrients to the fetus, influencing fetal metabolism and potentially stimulating metabolic inflammation (metaflammation), which may impact liver function. In fact, increased fetal liver size has been reported in GDM pregnancies. This study investigated the impact of GDM on fetal metaflammation and its potential association with the liver function parameters γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine transaminase (ALT), and bilirubin, in umbilical cord plasma (UCP). UCP samples were collected following healthy (n=57) and GDM pregnancies (n=25). Gluco-metabolic and lipid profiles, inflammatory markers, and liver function parameters were analyzed and the impact of GDM and the interrelation of liver biomarkers with maternal and neonatal parameters was assessed. UCP from GDM pregnancies exhibited increased levels of metaflammation-associated markers, including triglycerides, interleukin-6 and C- reactive protein (CRP). Among liver parameters, the detoxification and antioxidant defense enzyme GGT was elevated, whereas ALT and bilirubin species remained unchanged. Correlation analysis revealed that although GGT was increased in GDM, it was associated with improved metabolic characteristics, including reduced insulin resistance, insulin, C-peptide, and leptin, and increased high-density lipoprotein. Overall, these findings indicate that GDM environment shifts fetal metabolism toward metaflammation and elevates GGT, an enzyme involved in detoxification and protection against oxidative stress. The inverse association of GGT with insulin resistance suggests a compensatory role of GGT, potentially mitigating fetal metabolic and inflammatory disturbances in GDM through its antioxidant activity.",

    "Abstract": "Older people are prone to involuntary fasting, but systematic assessment of their mobilization and oxidation of the three macronutrients during fasting has not been previously reported. Because of changes in body composition and metabolic regulatory pathways with aging, older people might have different kinetics of utilization of macronutrient stores during fasting than younger people. We measured body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and studied the effects of a 36-hour fast on protein mobilization, lipolysis, glucose output, and protein, fat, and carbohydrate oxidation in 10 older (60–81 y) and 10 younger (18–35 y) healthy adults. A 36-hour fast induced a pronounced shift toward fat oxidation: in the postabsorptive state fat oxidation averaged 52–55% of resting energy expenditure (REE) and increased to 63–68% after fasting, with corresponding decreases in carbohydrate oxidation. Protein oxidation decreased with fasting but still contributed 16–18% of REE in older participants. For several metabolic variables (respiratory exchange ratio, glucose Ra, glycerol Ra, urea Ra, urea excretion, and percent of REE from carbohydrate and fat), we observed significant age×fasting interactions (P &lt; 0.01). Younger adults exhibited larger decreases in glucose Ra and greater increases in markers of protein turnover (leucine Ra, urea production) and lipolysis, whereas older adults showed blunted glucose and leucine responses but maintained substantial protein oxidation. These age-related differences suggest that older adults rely relatively more on ongoing protein catabolism during short-term fasting, which may contribute to vulnerability to muscle loss during illness or prolonged inadequate intake.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background: Ultra-processed food (UPF) intake may influence outcomes in long-term cancer survivors. This study examined the relationship between post-diagnostic UPF consumption and mortality and assessed whether chronic disease biomarkers explain this association. Methods: We longitudinally analysed 802 men and women with a previous cancer diagnosis (any site) recruited in the Moli-sani Study (2005-2010). Food intake data was collected at baseline, and assessed an average of 8.4 years after diagnosis. UPF was defined according to the Nova classification and calculated as a weight ratio. The Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was used to assess overall diet quality. Inflammatory, metabolic, and cardiovascular biomarkers were analysed as potential explanatory factors on the basis of change-in-estimate. Results: During a median follow-up of 14.6 years, a total of 281 deaths occurred. Multivariable (including the MDS)-adjusted HRs of higher UPF consumption for all-cause and cancer mortality, were 1.48 (95%CI 1.07-2.03 for highest vs. lowest third) and 1.57 (95%CI 1.00-2.47), respectively. Taken together, inflammation markers and resting heart rate levels attenuated the associations of UPF with all-cause mortality by approximately 40%. Conclusions: Higher consumption of UPFs after cancer diagnosis was associated with increased all-cause and cancer mortality rates, irrespective of diet quality. Part of these associations was explained by elevated levels of inflammation markers and resting heart rate. Impact: These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence linking UPFs to adverse health outcomes in cancer survivors. Further research is needed to identify specific mechanisms underlying this relationship and to explore potential dietary interventions for improving long-term survival.",

This first-of-its-kind report encompasses progress against pediatric cancers made over the past decade and chronicles major developments in molecularly targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and genomic profiling that are reshaping pediatric cancer diagnosis, surveillance, and treatment. The report also underscores the enduring challenges that impede progress, including the lack of effective therapies for rarer and aggressive pediatric cancers and the persistent inequities in access to high-quality treatment and supportive care, both in the United States and worldwide. Collectively, these insights reaffirm the urgent need for increased federal investment, strengthened international collaboration, and innovative research strategies to accelerate progress against pediatric cancer.

Their functions are tightly controlled by regulatory circuits, often referred to as checkpoints, and are profoundly shaped by local environments. In cancer, tissue perturbations cause immune cell recruitment, spatial re-distribution, and accordant functional adaptations. Here, we discuss how tissue-specific cues regulate NK/ILC functions in cancer, and how local regulatory circuits shape their cellular states and effector programs.

However, achieving durable immune control and long-term survival, particularly in high-risk patients, remains difficult. In this article, we review the immune effects of existing and emerging therapies, dissect key drivers of resistance, highlight rational combinations and treatment-sequencing strategies, and summarize ongoing clinical trials that aim to optimize durable immune control. We discuss how the application of these biological and clinical insights may help us rethink multiple myeloma treatment to fully eradicate residual disease and elicit sustained natural and/or synthetic tumor-specific immunity. Significance: Preclinical and clinical insights are reshaping how immune-based therapies are used in multiple myeloma. This review explores how optimizing the integration of natural and synthetic immunity can support a shift from disease control to deep, durable immune eradication, paving the way for personalized immune strategies tailored to individual immune profiles.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Abdominoperineal resection (APR) for low rectal cancer results in permanent stoma, psychosocial distress, and systemic inflammation, impairing quality of life and survival. This study evaluated whether app-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) plus biomarker-guided nutrition could improve recovery and survival. Methods: In this prospective, single-center, non-randomized controlled cohort, 186 patients with stage I–III low rectal adenocarcinoma undergoing curative abdominoperineal resection (APR) all received standard Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) care. Patients were managed with ERAS alone or ERAS plus an integrative program combining digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and inflammation-guided precision nutrition, tailored according to prognostic nutritional index (PNI), C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Interventions began two weeks preoperatively and continued for six months. Primary outcomes were longitudinal changes in depression, sleep quality, sexual function, and health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes included inflammatory markers, skeletal muscle index (SMI), and two-year disease-free and overall survival. Results: By month 3, the intervention group showed greater improvements in all primary outcomes, sustained through 24 months (all p &lt; 0.001). CRP and IL-6 were reduced by day 7 (both p &lt; 0.001), with faster recovery and shorter hospitalization. SMI was better preserved at 24 months (p = 0.046). Two-year DFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.26–0.89, p = 0.021) and OS (HR = 0.44, 95% CI 0.20–0.95, p = 0.036) were significantly improved. Findings remained robust in multivariable and sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Among patients undergoing APR managed within an ERAS pathway, the addition of digital CBT and inflammation-guided nutrition was associated with improved multidimensional recovery and favorable survival signals. Given the non-randomized design, these results should be regarded as hypothesis-generating and support further evaluation of ERAS-based integrative strategies in randomized multicenter trials.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) and its main subtypes, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), impose an enormous health burden on elders. Assessment of the circulating proteome to illuminate pathogenesis could open new opportunities for treatment. METHODS: We conducted a plasma proteomics screen of incident HF and its subtypes in 2 older population-based cohorts, the CHS (Cardiovascular Health Study) and the AGES-RS (Aging, Gene/Environment Susceptibility–Reykjavik Study). The 2 studies used SomaLogic platforms, with 4404 aptamers in common. Multivariable Cox models were fit to evaluate individual-protein associations with HF, HFpEF, and HFrEF separately in each cohort, and study-specific associations were combined by fixed-effects meta-analysis. Replication was performed in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) cohort. Two-sample Mendelian randomization of HF and its subtypes, along with colocalization analysis, was performed to support causal inference. RESULTS: Among 8599 participants, 1590 experienced incident HF (536 HFpEF, 471 HFrEF). There were 119 proteins associated with HF, 15 proteins with HFpEF, and 11 proteins with HFrEF, at Bonferroni-corrected significance. Among these, 9 have never previously been identified for cardiovascular diseases, and another 61 represent new associations with incident HF or its subtypes. Of these 70 proteins, 55 of the 66 available replicated externally. Mendelian randomization analysis revealed 7 proteins genetically associated with HF at nominal significance; 2 were separately associated with HFpEF, and another 2 with HFrEF. Seven of these 9 proteins (NCDP1, APOF, LMAN2 [lectin, mannose-binding 2], ADIPOQ [adiponectin], CD14 [cluster of differentiation 14], ARHGAP1 [Rho GTPase-activating protein 1], C9 [complement 9]) showed new, possibly causal associations, although we did not detect evidence for colocalization. CONCLUSIONS: In this large-scale proteomic study involving 3 longitudinal cohorts of older adults, we identified and replicated 55 novel protein markers of HF or its subtypes, and 7 new, possibly causal proteins. These proteins may enhance risk prediction, improve understanding of pathobiology, and help prioritize targets for therapeutic development of these foremost disorders in elders.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a frequent comorbidity in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), which includes distinct subtypes with various characteristics. However, data on the long-term prognostic impact of MR and its progression or regression over time remain limited, particularly across individual HCM subtypes. METHODS: Patients with HCM were retrospectively included from a Japanese multicenter registry and compared by MR severity (moderate or greater versus mild or less) within each subtype: hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), end-stage HCM (ES-HCM), and other HCM (including nonobstructive, midventricular obstruction, and apical HCM). RESULTS: Among 3602 patients (HOCM: n=837; ES-HCM: n=275; other HCM: n=2490), the prevalence of moderate or greater MR was highest in HOCM (36.3%), followed by ES-HCM (21.5%) and other HCM (8.5%). During a median follow-up of 5.3 (interquartile range, 2.1–9.3) years, the cumulative 5-year incidence of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization was not significantly different between the moderate or greater MR and mild or less MR groups in HOCM (14.6% versus 12.4%; P =0.35) or ES-HCM (60.7% versus 54.7%; P =0.84). After adjustment for clinical covariates, no significant association was observed in either subtype (HOCM: hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.79–1.60], P =0.51; ES-HCM: hazard ratio, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.55–1.28], P =0.42). In contrast, in other HCM, moderate or greater MR was significantly associated with the higher 5-year cumulative incidence of all-cause death or heart failure hospitalization (34.2% versus 13.9%, P &lt;0.001), which remained significant after adjustment, with a significant interaction (hazard ratio, 1.45 [95% CI, 1.09–1.91], P =0.01; P interaction =0.02). MR severity improved over time in HOCM, showed no clear change in ES-HCM, and worsened in other HCM ( P &lt;0.001, 0.46, and &lt;0.001, respectively; P interaction &lt;0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with HCM, moderate or greater MR was not associated with worse outcomes in HOCM or ES-HCM, but had significant prognostic implications in other HCM subtypes, suggesting the need for HCM subtype-specific MR management.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is a key feature of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Previously, we demonstrated decreased Wnt7a transcript levels, causing reduced angiogenesis in PAH. Wnt7a expression correlates with tip formation via ROR2 (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2), a tyrosine kinase receptor. We hypothesized that ROR2 activation in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) promotes angiogenesis, particularly endothelial barrier establishment, and its loss causes PAH. METHODS: Endothelial-specific ROR2 knockout (ROR2 ECKO) and wild-type mice were studied under normoxia and chronic hypoxia using echocardiography, hemodynamics, and lung morphometry. PMVECs from healthy and PAH lungs were transfected with ROR2 siRNA/constructs for functional and molecular studies. Focal adhesion activation and force generation were assessed via Förster resonance energy transfer-based methods. Bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses were performed on siROR2 (ROR2 siRNA) PMVECs and ROR2 ECKO lungs. RESULTS: ROR2 ECKO mice exacerbated pulmonary hypertension and vascular remodeling in hypoxia. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of lung endothelial cells revealed dysregulated barrier formation and angiogenesis. Evans blue dye extravasation confirmed reduced endothelial barrier integrity in ROR2 ECKO mice. ROR2-deficient PAH PMVECs displayed increased adhesion, permeability, and focal adhesion numbers, with reduced VE-cadherin at cell junctions. Confocal imaging and foster resonance energy transfer revealed ROR2 localization in focal adhesions, interacting with ITGB1 (integrin β1) which remained in an active, adhesion-promoting state in ROR2-deficient cells. Restoring ROR2 in PAH PMVECs normalized adhesion, barrier function, and focal adhesion abundance. Transcriptomic analysis revealed Rab12 mediated ROR2-ITGB1 crosstalk, whose knockdown mimicked ROR2 deficiency in PMVECs. CONCLUSIONS: ROR2 regulates pulmonary angiogenesis by maintaining endothelial barrier integrity and facilitating integrin recycling. ROR2 restoration could be a potential therapeutic approach for PAH.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite antiplatelet therapy, plaque-induced strokes recur frequently. This recurrence may reflect thrombus heterogeneity driven by peri-stenotic stagnation and red blood cell (RBC) entrapment. The clinical implications of such variations for stroke outcomes remain unclear. We investigated whether plaque-derived RBC-rich thrombi, indicated by the clot sign, were associated with recurrence, lesion volume, and stenosis-related hemodynamics. METHODS: Because asymptomatic plaque rupture limits direct evaluation of hemodynamics and thrombus compositions, we performed a hybrid human-animal study. In humans, we conducted a retrospective case-control study across 2 tertiary stroke centers in the Republic of Korea between April 2017 and March 2024, evaluating stroke recurrence and lesion volume by clot sign, using inverse probability of treatment weighting. We included artery-to-artery embolization confirmed by diffusion weighted imaging, excluding other etiologies. In animals, thrombus compositions were histologically analyzed in an FeCl 3 -induced stenosis model across 3 segments (ascent, peak, and descent). Peri-stenotic hemodynamics, including wall shear stress and relative residence time, were assessed using ultrafast ultrasound imaging to evaluate whether RBC entrapment correlated with elevated relative residence time. RESULTS: In humans, clot sign-positive patients exhibited higher recurrence risk (hazard ratio, 2.76 [95% CI, 1.32–5.74]; P =0.007), and larger lesion (mean difference, 16.14 [95% CI, 5.03–27.25]; P =0.005). In animals, RBCs proportion was increased in the descent (ascent, 23.89±15.91%; peak, 12.33±11.19%; descent, 59.58±35.09%; P =0.019), correlating with a 3-fold higher relative residence time in the descent than the other regions (ascent, 1.25±0.75 au; peak, 1.55±0.55 au; descent, 4.50±2.74 au; P =0.001) CONCLUSIONS: Peri-stenotic stagnation was associated with RBC-rich thrombi formation under both clinical and experimental conditions, providing mechanistic insight into stroke recurrence and larger lesion volumes. Identifying peri-stenotic stagnation using ultrafast ultrasound imaging may help stratify high-risk patients; however, its therapeutic implications require validation in prospective randomized studies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper proposes a spatial model of imperfect competition in markets with adverse or advantageous selection. The model shows that a reduction in competition exacerbates the inefficiency created by adverse selection but can ameliorate the inefficiency created by advantageous selection. However, reduced competition never corrects the inefficiency perfectly because it introduces an allocative inefficiency. By contrast, the inefficiency can be corrected perfectly through a corrective tax when there is perfect competition. Our results have implications for competition policy in credit and insurance markets, as they caution against viewing imperfect competition as a solution to the inefficiencies created by selection.",

    "Abstract": "Objective This study investigates how users’ trust evolves during their first ride in a fully driverless robotaxi and how it can be affected by user characteristics, system design, and traffic scenarios. Background As driving automation technology matures, driverless robotaxis have become available. Despite its immense economic and social potential, public acceptance can be strongly influenced by user trust. Previous research on trust in autonomous vehicles often relied on surveys, driving simulators, or “Wizard of Oz” methods, potentially introducing biases. Method An on-road experiment was conducted in commercially operating fully driverless robotaxis on public urban roads. In total, 30 participants with no prior experience riding fully driverless robotaxis were recruited, comprising nondrivers ( n = 10), and drivers with ( n = 10) and without ( n = 10) driving automation experience. Dynamic trust was collected at a 2-min interval during the ride, along with participants’ think-aloud for changes in trust. A cumulative link mixed model was used to assess the impact of past driving experience, demographics, and riding time on trust development. Results Our findings revealed that dynamic trust increased gradually and stabilized over time, with user heterogeneity playing a moderating role in this process. Further think-aloud data analysis identified key factors in trust formation, including driving style, riding safety and comfort, and user interface design. Conclusion Trust in driverless robotaxis builds progressively with real-world exposure, shaped by user characteristics, vehicle control, and interface design. Application Our findings underscore the importance of considering user heterogeneity in fostering trust and acceptance of robotaxis.",

    "Abstract": "Recent decades have been characterized by an exponential increase in medico-legal litigation and an accentuated interest in healthcare responsibility. This study aims to examine cases of alleged medical negligence in Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery in one of the largest hospitals in north-west Italy, over a 11-year period (2013–2023). The primary objective of this study is to conduct a comparative analysis between compensation claims initially advanced by patients (or their legal representatives) in the pre-trial phase and the final outcomes of legal proceedings brought before the court. This article provides an important opportunity for a critical and in-depth analysis of litigation in the fields of cardiology and cardiac surgery, with the aim of improving the efficiency of case management. In the period 2013–2023, San Martino Polyclinic Hospital received a total of 1704 compensation claims, of which 39 (2.29%) were related to alleged cardiological and cardiosurgical professional liabilities. About 64.10% of the compensation claims (25 out of 39) were deemed illegitimate due to the absence of professional responsibility, and were therefore rejected by the Claims Management Committee (CMC). In 38.5% of cases, legal action was pursued, and in four cases, the hospital was ordered to compensate the patient for medical negligence. Conversely, in three cases, the Judge's ruling was in favour of the Hospital. Currently, eight legal actions remain ongoing, and their outcomes are pending. Overall, over the 11-year study period, litigation cases in the cardiology and cardiac surgery fields were relatively infrequent.",

The CDC COVID-19 Calculator used a web-based chatbot format that mimicked a 2-person conversation. The calculator had the following design specifications: (1) reach an audience of people with COVID-19 (who tested positive or were symptomatic for COVID-19) and their close contacts and (2) provide an answer to the question “When can I leave home?” in less than 1 minute. To measure the use of the calculator, we analyzed the number of anonymous unique visitors and median visit time. The calculator had approximately 13.6 million visitors by March 1, 2024. The median visit time was 38 seconds, and approximately 65% of visits were via smartphones. The millions of unique visitors to the CDC COVID-19 Calculator demonstrated the usefulness of a conversational chatbot format to provide public health guidance.

    "Abstract": "This paper investigates the control of non-cooperative spacecraft rendezvous system with sensor fault, actuator saturation and external disturbance. First, based on the second-order fully actuated system model of the non-cooperative spacecraft rendezvous system, a state observer is introduced to reduce the influence of sensor faults on the system stability. In order to solve the problem of actuator saturation, an anti-windup compensator is designed. Then, based on the designed observer and anti-windup compensator, an anti-windup controller is designed by combining with fully actuated system approach, fault-tolerant control, and integral sliding mode control. And the stability analysis is given. The main advantages of the proposed methods are: a second-order fully actuated system model is established to avoid the complexity of converting an inherently second-order system into a first-order form. In addition, since the model established does not require linearization processing, the model description is more accurate, and the steady-state error of the control system is smaller. By using the fully actuated system method to design the controller, as long as the high-order fully actuated system model of the system is provided, the controller can be directly designed, which simplifies the design steps of the control system. And the designed controller eliminates the nonlinear terms of the system, reducing the complexity of the stability analysis for the closed-loop system. Finally, a numerical simulation example is provided to show the usefulness of the method.",

    "Abstract": "Background The issues of diagnosis and treatment strategy for the left renal vein compression (LRVC) have not been fully resolved, and treatment methods vary widely from medical therapy to renal autotransplantation. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of isolated interventions on the left ovarian vein in patients with LRVC of varying severity. Methods This prospective cohort study included 63 female patients with LRVC (30 symptomatic and 33 asymptomatic), selected out of 266 consecutively examined patients with pelvic venous disorders (PeVD). All participants underwent blood and urine tests, duplex ultrasound studies (DUS) of the renal and pelvic veins, and dynamic renal scintigraphy (DRS). Patients with LRVC and symptoms of pelvic venous insufficiency (PVI) and/or reflux in the left ovarian vein (LOV) further underwent ovarian vein resection or embolization. Follow-up clinical and laboratory evaluations, DUS, and DRS were performed 1 to 12 months after the intervention. Results LRVC was diagnosed in 23.6% of patients with PeVD, and was symptomatic in 11.3% and hemodynamically significant, according to DUS, in 4.9% of them. None of patients with LRVC had renal symptoms (pain in the left flank of the abdomen, hematuria) or impaired filtration and secretory dysfunction of the left kidney (LK), according to DRS. Symptomatic LRVC was accompanied by clinical manifestations of PeVD. Ovarian vein interventions were performed in 24 symptomatic patients and resulted in elimination of chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and pelvic venous reflux (PVR) in all cases. Follow-up examinations did not reveal any deterioration in the blood outflow through LRV or disturbances in the LK function after intervention in any patient. Conclusions LRVC without hematuria does not deteriorate the LK filtration and secretory functions. Patients with symptomatic LRVC without hematuria can undergo isolated interventions on LOV. These interventions are effective in eliminating CPP and do not impair the LK function.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigated the psychosocial impact of perceived social stigma on adopted adolescents in Peshawar, Pakistan, focusing on emotional regulation difficulties, identity confusion and internalised shame. Grounded in Goffman’s stigma theory and Erikson’s theory of identity development, the research examined how stigmatising societal attitudes influence adolescents aware of their adoptive status. A total of 709 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years, who had lived with their adoptive families for at least three years and were enrolled in formal education, completed structured questionnaires with newly developed and validated scales measuring stigma, shame, identity confusion and emotional regulation. Using structural equation modelling, findings revealed that perceived social stigma significantly predicted internalised shame, emotional regulation difficulties and identity confusion. Internalised shame acted as a key psychological mechanism in these associations. Adolescents who felt stigmatised were more likely to internalise this negativity as shame, which in turn heightened their struggles with emotional regulation and identity development. These results highlight the psychological toll of stigmatisation on adopted youth and underscore the critical role of shame in shaping their development. The findings provide insights for educators, psychologists and social workers in supporting adopted adolescents and suggest the need for stigma reduction efforts in educational and social settings.",

    "Abstract": "Health systems provide essential resources to optimize, maintain, or restore the health of populations. The extent to which a health system can meet the needs of a local community can be considered the system’s “capacity”; however, it is unclear what this constitutes. We conducted a standardized rapid review to understand how health system capacity has been conceptualized in academic and grey literature. We conducted duplicate screening and data extraction. We summarized document characteristics descriptively and definitions/frameworks narratively. We identified 22 relevant documents; three (14%) provided a definition and 20 (91%) provided a framework. Each definition provided was unique. We synthesized reported frameworks into 11 key elements of health system capacity. We identified an infrequent and inconsistent conceptualization of health system capacity in published literature; however, this review may be used as a starting point for defining and describing key elements of capacity.",

    "Abstract": "Background and purpose Access to healthcare remains difficult for many, particularly in underserved areas. In Italy's Marche Region, parish nursing agencies have been introduced as a territorial care strategy for enhancing access to healthcare and strengthening community-based services. The aim of this study is to assess the socio-demographic characteristics, service utilization, and satisfaction of users attending a parish nursing agency in the Marche Region. Methods and procedures This quantitative, cross-sectional explorative study drew on original data collected through an anonymous questionnaire completed by clients of a parish nursing agency. The responses were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods. Results 82 individuals participated; 77% were autonomous, while 23% were accompanied by a caregiver. Among those without caregivers, 24% were foreigners, significantly higher than the regional average. Most users had a high educational level and at least one chronic condition. Frequently requested services included medical appointment scheduling, vital sign monitoring, and health information. Satisfaction was high: 83% rated the service as “excellent”, and 17% as “satisfying”. Conclusion These preliminary findings indicate that parish nursing can provide accessible, person-centered, and satisfactory care to vulnerable individuals from diverse educational and socioeconomic backgrounds and suggest that parish nursing agencies could be considered a valuable component in shaping health policy recommendations.",

    "Abstract": "In a recent issue of Economic Development Quarterly , Johnson et al. took issue with the contention that there is a strong scholarly consensus that professional sports facilities are not advisable public investments. Johnson et al. argued that opinion surveys of economists may be flawed, research reaches somewhat ambiguous conclusions, and that existing reviews of academic literature do not provide a balanced assessment of the evidence. Thus, Johnson et al. concluded that a judicious policy approach requires weighing the costs and benefits of individual stadium projects. This reply evaluates these claims and demonstrates that they do not have merit; therefore, it is accurate to describe the academic consensus as generally opposed to public underwriting of professional sports venues.",

    "Abstract": "In equine husbandry, oral cavity procedures are commonly performed and may be associated with complications, including extraoral diseases, potentially resulting from bacterial contamination and inadequate antisepsis. Bacterial resistance to antimicrobials is a major issue for healthcare professionals, including veterinarians that may misuse these pharmaceuticals. Therefore, developing novel methods for antisepsis is desirable. This study aims to test the effectiveness of a 100 µg/ml ozonized injectable water solution versus 0.12% chlorhexidine mouthwash. Fifty adult equines had swab samples collected from their oral cavities, to make cultures and isolate the main microorganisms present. Half of the animals then had their mouths washed with 0.12% chlorhexidine and the other half were treated with the 100 µg/ml ozonized solution mouthwash. Following these treatments, another swab sample was obtained from each animal, and the culture repeated. The number of colony-forming units (CFUs) and the number of times a microbe genus was present were counted. The genera isolated were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus , Klebsiella , Escherichia , Streptococcus , and Pseudomonas , as well as yeast cells. The first 3 were the most prevalent, present in over 70% of the animals. The authors concluded that in healthy horses, a single mouth rinse with a 100 µg/ml ozonized solution was less effective than 0.12% chlorhexidine for reducing CFU count and presence. This study confirmed the known efficacy of chlorhexidine and its superiority to ozonized water. It also highlighted the importance of performing procedures antiseptically.",

Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has emerged as the preferred imaging modality for identification and monitoring of AP in the human endodontic community. This study compared intraoral radiographs (IOR) and CBCT for identifying periapical lucency (PAL) (as a proxy for AP) of the maxillary fourth premolar teeth in dogs. All dogs had IOR and CBCT performed under general anesthesia. Imaging was evaluated retrospectively and compared. PAL was identified more frequently with CBCT, and results were statistically significant. No other statistically significant relationships were identified.

    "Abstract": "In an increasingly dynamic and technology-driven labour market, the development and assessment of soft skills have gained significant relevance. While higher education institutions (HEIs) play a pivotal role in preparing students for professional challenges, concerns persist regarding the alignment between the skills students develop and those expected by employers. This study investigates whether students’ perceptions of employers’ expectations are aligned with their self-assessments of soft skills, and if those perceptions vary according to gender and level of professional experience. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire administered to 384 students from a Portuguese HEI. Results reveal a statistically significant gap between what students believe employers expect and how well they feel they meet those expectations. Gender-based differences emerged, with male students emphasising strategic and instrumental skills, while female students reporting higher confidence in relational competencies. The study also finds that students with higher self-perceived skills are more willing to invest financially in further development. These findings reinforce the need for HEIs to adopt more targeted and inclusive strategies for soft skills development, in close collaboration with employers. The study contributes to the growing discourse on graduate employability and offers practical implications for curriculum design and career readiness initiatives.",

    "Abstract": "Vapor injection enthalpy-enhanced technology is key to addressing the issues of heating capacity degradation and energy efficiency reduction in heat pumps under low-temperature conditions. Against this backdrop, this paper focuses on resolving the challenge of excessively elevated discharge temperatures in heat pump systems during low-temperature operation. A thermodynamic model is constructed to analyze the influence of vapor injection parameters in superheated and two-phase states on compressor performance. An experimental platform for vapor injection scroll compressors was built. The vapor injection state was regulated using electric heaters, and the system performance under different refrigerant injection state levels was compared and analyzed. This study shows that during superheated vapor injection, with the increase of injection temperature, the main branch flow rate, total mass flow rate, and heating capacity slightly decrease, while the coefficient of performance (COP) increases. During two-phase vapor injection, with the increase of injection quality, the injection mass flow rate increased by 55.87% within the injection quality range of 60%–90%, and the heating capacity increases by 3.72%. Compared with the experimental data, the simulation errors of the two types of vapor injection are controlled within 10% respectively. Additionally, the injection point near the suction chamber enhances mass flow rate and heating capacity but increases power consumption and lowers COP, while the injection point near discharge chamber yields opposite trends. Based on these findings, injection strategies for different application scenarios are also proposed.",

    "Abstract": "Deep learning-based prediction of the mechanical properties of cold-rolled strip steel has generally overlooked the issue of data imbalance that exists in real-world production environments. Moreover, the production process of cold-rolled steel is highly nonlinear, with its mechanical properties influenced by multi-scale couplings between chemical compositions and process parameters. Existing studies have insufficiently explored the complex interactions between these factors and their impact on mechanical behavior. To address this issue, this paper proposes a composite loss function that integrates effective label density and per-sample error, aiming to mitigate the effects of data imbalance in steel rolling tasks. Additionally, a Multi-scale Gated Attention-Driven Network (MGAD-Net) based on the composite loss is introduced for predicting the mechanical properties of cold-rolled strip steel. Dilated convolutions are employed for hierarchical extraction of heterogeneous process-composition features. A sparse parallel self-attention mechanism is also applied to precisely model the cross-process interaction effects in the rolling procedure, enabling comprehensive extraction of complex feature relationships. Compared with existing networks, the proposed MGAD-Net achieves prediction accuracies of 99.45%, 97.89%, and 99.02% for yield strength, tensile strength, and elongation, respectively, with corresponding improvements in R 2 scores of 1.46%, 1.31%, and 3.82%.",

    "Abstract": "Enhancing power plant energy efficiency through waste heat recovery (WHR) bottoming cycles appears to offer great potential in approaching the net-zero targets. This research aims to recover power from flue gases of a 25 MW gas turbine through utilization of a recuperated WHR cycle with supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO 2 ) as its working fluid. Multi-objective optimization, based on the non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm II technique, was used to maximize the sCO 2 WHR cycle thermal efficiency and output power, simultaneously. Optimization results suggested a recuperated sCO 2 cycle capable of producing 1.3 MW electric power with a thermal efficiency of 16.5% at design condition. Results indicated possibility of generating even 3.2 MW of electricity with a thermal efficiency of 18.1% at the expense of slightly higher stream flow rates at design condition. To evaluate performance of the designed WHR cycle under different operating conditions, sensitivity analyses were conducted, including variations in compressor inlet pressure, temperature and pressure ratio. Topping cycle gas turbine off-design conditions was also investigated. Operating the gas turbine at 90% load resulted in combined cycle efficiency of about 35%, which is accompanied by 9% fuel saving and power plant emissions reductions. Moreover, the prospect of combined cycle thermal efficiency of 33.5% at 70% topping gas turbine load and 25% fuel saving appeared achievable. The estimated reduction in the power plant fuel consumption results in approximately 135 kgCO 2 /h emissions reduction from the topping gas turbine flue gases.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Individuals with both avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) and pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) report restrictive eating. Inflammatory and immunological alterations may drive the onset of restrictive eating and comorbid obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms in PANS, while the etiology of restrictive eating in ARFID is unknown. Nevertheless, few studies have explored PANS and related OC symptoms among individuals with ARFID. We aimed to identify the frequency and nature of PANS and OC symptoms among those with full or subthreshold ARFID. We also explored associations between OC severity, ARFID profiles, and infection history. Methods: The study included 37 adolescents and young adults with subthreshold or full ARFID. We quantified the frequency of PANS/pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection symptoms and diagnoses, as well as OC symptoms and severity, in our ARFID sample. We analyzed associations between ARFID profiles and OC severity, along with the relationship between infection history and OC severity. Results: Two individuals (5%) met PANS criteria, and 17 (46%) reported lifetime mild–severe OC severity. The fear of aversive consequences profile was associated with a significant increase in log-transformed OC severity (β = 1.2, p = 0.04, adjusted R 2 = 0.10) after adjusting for sensory sensitivity, lack of interest, and body mass index z-score. We did not find any associations between OC severity and infection history. Discussion: In the first study to examine PANS and related symptoms among individuals with ARFID, we demonstrated salient overlap between PANS, OC symptoms, and ARFID. Further research is needed to examine the relationship between ARFID and PANS.",

    "Abstract": "Objective Young people (YP) with a cleft lip with or without cleft palate have expressed concerns about their appearance and image-sharing on social media. This study aimed to explore and understand YP's concerns, views, and experiences regarding photographs of themselves. Design This was an exploratory qualitative study using photo-elicitation during semi-structured interviews conducted virtually. YP provided 3 photographs of themselves they liked and 3 they did not, which were used to facilitate discussion of their appearance, thoughts, and feelings about their photographs, and social media. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using Reflexive Thematic Analysis. Patients/Participants Thirteen YP aged 16 to 20 years (mean = 17.8), 10 females and 3 males, were recruited via a UK cleft charity. Two had a cleft lip only, 9 had a unilateral cleft lip and palate, and 2 had a bilateral cleft lip and palate. Results Four themes were developed: (1) symmetry equals beauty, (2) controlling and curating the image presented to others, (3) acceptance with maturity, and (4) connections can promote empowerment. Conclusions The themes highlight the concerns that YP have with their appearance, how they present their self-image to others, and how they can become empowered to embrace their cleft condition and support others.

    "Abstract": "Introduction High-dose systemic methotrexate (HD-MTX) in doses ≥ 3 g/m 2 is the cornerstone of treatment for central nervous system (CNS) lymphomas and prophylaxis for patients with high-risk of CNS relapse. Its administration requires extensive supportive care until serum clearance is achieved. Risk factors for delayed methotrexate (MTX) clearance and renal injury are well-characterized and include baseline renal function, age, and hypoalbuminemia. Data assessing characteristics associated with slow terminal clearance are lacking. Methods We performed a single-center, retrospective cohort study between 1/2015 to 10/2023 to evaluate characteristics associated with the rate of MTX clearance in the 72 h after serum MTX levels decline to below 0.2 µmol/L in adult patients with lymphoma who received MTX at doses ≥ 3 g/m 2 . MTX administration was evaluated at the cycle level with slow terminal clearance (STC) defined as &gt; 72 h to clear from &lt; 0.2 µmol/L to &lt; 0.05 µmol/L. Results Overall, 135 patients were included with a total of 462 cycles, median of 3 cycles, and 76 (56.3%) experienced at least one cycle of STC. Of 462 cycles, 138 (29.9%) were STC. Multivariable analysis, based on variables significant by univariable analysis, identified that age ≥ 80 years, BMI &gt; 30 kg/m 2 , first MTX level &gt; 10.0 µmol/L, and acute kidney injury (AKI) after MTX administration were significantly associated with STC. Conclusion Utilizing clinically and statistically significant variables from our analyses, we advocate for the development and validation of a model to inform supportive care management once MTX levels decline below 0.2 µmol/L.",

    "Abstract": "Background: En bloc and R0 resection of nonpedunculated colonic lesions by conventional endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) are challenging. Preliminary lesion molding-aided EMR (PM-EMR) is useful for reducing snaring slippage, which may increase successful en bloc and R0 resection rates. Herein, we compared PM-EMR and conventional EMR outcomes. Methods: Overall, 112 patients with nonpedunculated colonic lesions measuring 8–15 mm were randomly allocated to either the PM-EMR group or the conventional EMR group. Baseline characteristics and treatment results were analyzed between the groups. Results: En bloc resection and R0 resection were achieved in the PM-EMR group (100%, 94.6%) and the conventional EMR group (76.8%, 67.9%). For lesions ≥ 10 mm, en bloc and R0 resection rates were greater for PM-EMR than for conventional EMR (100.0% versus 74.4%; 94.4% versus 62.8%, respectively). For lesions with macroscopic morphologies indicating Is/IIa located in the left/right colon, PM-EMR was significantly better than conventional EMR for en bloc resection (100.0% versus 69.2%, 100% versus 76.5%; 100.0% versus 75.0%, 100.0% versus 68.2%, respectively) and R0 resection (100.0% versus 65.4%, 88.9% versus 52.9%; 100.0% versus 60.0%, 90.0% versus 63.6%, respectively). Conclusions: PM-EMR is significantly better than conventional EMR regarding en bloc and R0 resection of 10–15 mm nonpedunculated colorectal lesions.",

    "Abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction affects skeletal muscle (SkM) function and is critical in the etiology of age-related sarcopenia. The sirtuin 1-PGC1α pathway is a key regulator of mitochondrial mass, structure, and function. However, pathway activity decreases with aging. Cacao flavanols show promise in their ability to activate mitochondrial pathways. We evaluated the capacity of the flavanol (+)-epicatechin (+Epi) to stimulate such a pathway and favorably impact mitochondrial and oxidative stress (OS)-associated endpoints in aged SkM. Using 23-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats, an 8-week oral administration of +Epi (1 mg/kg/day) was implemented, and results were compared versus vehicle-treated controls. Assessments included the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)/sirtuin 1/PGC1α pathway, acetylated proteins levels, mitochondrial function and biogenesis, as well as OS-related endpoints in SkM. +Epi increased the NAD/NADH ratio, activation of sirtuin 1, the deacetylation of nuclear protein content, including that of PGC1α. Also, +Epi induced increases of TFAM and NRF1 mRNA levels, deacetylation of mitochondrial complex I and V, increases in complex I activity, sirtuin 3, complexes I and V, mitofilin, and TFAM protein levels. SkM citrate synthase activity and ATP content increased with +Epi. OS markers in proteins and lipids were reduced, while buffering systems (superoxide dismutase 2 and catalase protein and activities) increased. In white blood cells, we documented serial reductions in mitochondrial DNA content and citrate synthase activity with aging, which were either fully or partially reversed with +Epi. Results demonstrate that +Epi treatment yields positive effects on mitochondrial biogenesis and function, leading to decreased OS and improved SkM bioenergetics in aged rats.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Simulation-based learning is increasingly integrated into medical education; however, the use of simulation in palliative medicine is generally limited to ad hoc communication skills and pain management. There is a recognized need for a structured approach to a simulation-based curriculum aligned with the unique challenges in complex symptom management and emergencies in palliative medicine specialty training. Objectives: To identify and prioritize key clinical topics for a simulation curriculum for palliative medicine specialty training. Methods: Using Kern’s six-step approach to curriculum development, we conducted a two-phase needs assessment. Phase 1 was a survey of 101 palliative care practitioners to identify topics appropriate for more intensive training. Phase 2 applied the Delphi method with 46 participants to achieve consensus on priorities. Results: Ten high-priority simulation topics emerged: dyspnea crisis, complex pain management, acute pain crisis, terminal agitated delirium, airway obstruction, existential distress, palliative sedation, intractable nausea and vomiting, opioid use disorder, and ventilatory support withdrawal. These aligned with competency-based and entrustable professional activities. Conclusions: This study addresses the gaps in simulation use for complex and emergent clinical situations. Next steps include validation with residency program directors, mapping existing resources, and developing new content, supporting a collaborative approach to advancing palliative specialty education.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Delirium is a common and distressing complication in terminally ill patients with advanced cancer, often impairing communication and decision-making, and diminishing the quality of the remaining life. Effective symptom management is essential; however, current clinical guidelines offer limited recommendations, and supporting evidence remains insufficient. Objectives: This scoping review systematically mapped the existing literature on pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for delirium symptom management in terminally ill patients with cancer and identified gaps in the evidence base. Methods: Following the framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Ichushi-Web of the Japan Medical Abstract Society for studies published up to August 31, 2023. Subsequently, two updated searches were conducted using the same procedure with the first covering studies published between September 1, 2023, and September 30, 2024, and the second covering studies published between October 1, 2024, and September 30, 2025. Eligible studies evaluated interventions for delirium in adults with terminal cancer with a life expectancy of one month or less. Two reviewers independently screened the studies for inclusion. Results: Of the 1640 articles identified, seven met the inclusion criteria including four randomized controlled trials on pharmacologic interventions, one randomized controlled trial on hydration, and two observational studies on opioid switching. All studies targeted terminally ill patients with advanced cancer and assessed the outcomes related to delirium symptom relief. Conclusions: This review revealed that the literature addressing delirium symptom management in terminally ill patients with cancer is limited and heterogeneous. Further research is warranted to strengthen the evidence base and to inform clinical practice guidelines for the care of this vulnerable population.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming health care by enhancing diagnostics, improving patient outcomes, and reducing administrative burdens through advanced algorithms, with applications in medical imaging, virtual care, and automated data analysis. However, its role in palliative and hospice care remains underexplored. Aim: This review synthesizes research on AI applications in palliative and hospice care, examining its technological and clinical contributions to inform future research and guide clinical implementation. Design: An integrative literature review, guided by Whittemore and Knafl’s framework, analyzed qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method studies. Registered with PROSPERO. Data Sources: A comprehensive search across 11 databases: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, ProQuest Dissertations &amp; Theses Global, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore, identified English-language studies published from 2010 to 2024. Studies on AI applications in clinical settings, model validation, and key findings were included, with quality assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Results: Seventy studies (2018–2024) were included, primarily quantitative analyses of retrospective clinical and administrative data. AI applications supported mortality prediction, symptom monitoring, patient needs identification, communication facilitation, care planning, and resource allocation. Early tools included rule-based and structured-data models, while more recent approaches integrate unstructured clinical notes, wearable devices, and multimodal data for individualized prognostication and timely interventions. Key barriers included reliance on retrospective or single-center datasets, limited generalizability, ethical and equity concerns, and challenges in integrating AI into clinical workflows. Conclusions: AI holds potential in enhancing timely, patient-centered palliative and hospice care, supporting prognostication, symptom management, and decision-making. Successful integration requires attention to clinician trust, workflow alignment, equity, and ethical considerations. To maximize its impact on underutilization, future research should focus on multicenter validation, representative datasets, ethical deployment, and seamless integration into clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: This study examined sex differences in pain intensity and unpleasantness among cognitively healthy older adults. While females generally exhibit heightened pain sensitivity, research on sex differences in older adults remains limited. We aimed to determine whether these differences persist in aging populations without cognitive impairment. Methods: A sample of 58 community-dwelling older adults (≥60 years, 34 females, 24 males) were included in this pain psychophysics study to assess differences by sex. Cognitive status was assessed using the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) or Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS). Depression, anxiety, and baseline pain were also assessed. Evoked heat pain stimuli at fixed temperatures (34°C, 39°C, 44°C) were delivered via the Medoc Q-Sense system with pain intensity and unpleasantness rated immediately after each stimulus. Results: Females reported significantly higher pain intensity than males ( p = .02; female mean = 4.6 [95% CI: 3.9, 5.3], male mean = 3.5 [95% CI: 2.9, 4.2]). Sex differences in reported pain intensity were consistent across the three stimulus intensity levels (sex by temperature interaction p = .35). Pain unpleasantness did not differ significantly between sexes ( p = .14) nor was the sex by temperature interaction significant ( p = .35). Conclusion: Findings confirm sex differences in perceived pain intensity among cognitively healthy older adults, with females reporting higher pain levels. In contrast, no significant sex differences were observed in the affective component of pain. These results underscore the importance of incorporating sex-specific considerations in the assessment and management of pain intensity in older adults.",

SCH is an uncommon vascular disease that most often presents as cutaneous or subcutaneous nodules in the distal extremities and only rarely in deep soft tissues. Case presentation A 57-year-old woman developed secondary orbital involvement with two tumors 40 years after removal of a cavernous hemangioma in the same orbit. CT and MRI images showed two tumors in the left orbit. Both were removed entirely via a transconjunctival anterior orbital approach combined with a nasal endoscopic transethmoidal approach. Pathology showed SCH and cavernous hemangioma. Conclusion Coexistence of SCH and cavernous hemangioma in the same area suggests a continuum and a shared origin. Although SCH is rare and its preoperative diagnosis is challenging, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma.",

    "Abstract": "Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. There is no current cure for glaucoma, and it is managed by lowering intraocular pressure, a major modifiable risk factor. Nutraceuticals have long been studied to protect retinal ganglion cells and the optic nerve from degeneration by targeting the metabolic and neurodegenerative aspects of glaucoma, and even contributing to pressure lowering. A range of vitamins, minerals and nutraceuticals have been and are undergoing investigation for glaucoma. Compounds such as NAD-boosting supplements, antioxidants, and combination therapies can potentially support retinal ganglion cell metabolism and reduce oxidative stress, leading to healthier neurons to preserve vision for longer. However, varying levels of evidence exist to support the use of nutraceuticals in glaucoma. Herein lies a comprehensive review on the latest research evidence for 35 different vitamins, minerals, and nutraceuticals, their proposed mechanism of action, and reported effects on retinal ganglion cell health and in people with glaucoma.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Robotic-arm assisted systems are being increasingly used for primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs). However, their use in the surgically more complex revision THAs (rTHAs) has remained limited. This case series describes the surgical techniques used in 5 cases of robotic-arm assisted rTHA and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of robotic-arm assisted systems. Methods: 5 rTHAs were performed using a robotic-arm assisted system with CT-based planning and robotic-guided acetabular reconstruction. Clinical data, intraoperative details, and postoperative findings were retrospectively reviewed. Discussion: Robotic-arm assisted rTHA offers detailed preoperative planning, including simulation of acetabular cup positioning, range of motion, and identification of osteophytic impingement risks. The flexibility of selecting reliable registration points is essential in cases with acetabular bone defects. Real-time calculations of hip length, offset, and bone void locations allow for tailored reconstruction without the need for intraoperative radiography. Conclusions: This case series demonstrates that robotic-arm assisted rTHA provides valuable surgical guidance, particularly in preoperative planning and intraoperative precision. Its use in complex revisions shows promise in optimising outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "Aims: This retrospective multicentre study, involving 38 UK hospital trusts, aimed to characterise the demographic features, inpatient management, and referral patterns of patients with prosthetic hip dislocations. The primary focus was to identify factors influencing a definitive management plan following acute total hip arthroplasty (THA) dislocation, and to assess differences in the management of primary versus revision THA dislocations. Methods: Data from 645 patients who sustained acute prosthetic hip dislocations between 01 January 2019 and 31 July 2019, were collected from electronic medical records. Patients were divided into Primary and Revision THA groups. Statistical analyses were used to explore demographic patterns, comparative analyses, and factors influencing referral decisions, with significance set at p &lt; 0.05. Results: The mean age of patients was 76.2 years, with a predominance of females (65.7%) and posterior dislocations (72.7%). Of the patients, 37.8% underwent reduction in the Emergency Department (ED), with a success rate of 69.7%, while 72.9% required reduction in theatre, achieving a success rate of 90.6%. Inpatient mortality was 1.2%. Only 32.5% of patients had a definitive management plan following their dislocation. Primary THA patients ( n = 504) were predominantly female (69.6%) compared to Revision THA patients ( n = 141, 48.9%, p &lt; 0.001). Anterior dislocations were more common in the Revision THA group (26.2% vs. 17.3%, p = 0.017). The primary THA group had a higher success rate in closed reduction (92.9% vs. 82.9%, p = 0.002). Revision THA patients were more likely to have a definitive management plan (52.9% vs. 26.9%, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: This study highlights significant variability in the management of THA dislocations, particularly in the lack of standardised protocols for inpatient management and onward referral to revision arthroplasty surgeons. Standardisation of care pathways is needed to optimise outcomes for patients with prosthetic hip dislocations.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The optimal threshold to blood transfusion in patients after hip fracture surgery is unclear. This study leveraged regression discontinuity to quantify blood transfusion practices across haemoglobin thresholds of 7.0, 8.0, and 10.0 g/dL. Methods: This study used the enhanced claims-based Premier Inc. database and included inpatients, aged 50+, with an ICD-10 code for hip fracture and hip surgery, and at least one haemoglobin following surgery. For each patient-day following surgery, we determined the lowest haemoglobin level and whether blood transfusion was administered. Regression discontinuity (RD) models with local linear regression were used to calculate risk differences, mean differences, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for blood transfusion use. Results: There were 320,194 patient-days (among 93,111 patients) included in analyses. Transfusion occurred on 29,425 patient-days (9.2%). The median haemoglobin on patient-days with a transfusion was 7.0 (interquartile range [IQR] 6.7–7.6) g/dL and the median haemoglobin on patient-days without a transfusion was 9.3 (IQR 8.4–10.4) g/dL. There was a statistically significant increase in transfusion use crossing a haemoglobin threshold of 7.0 g/dL (19.0; 95% CI, 13.5–22.5 absolute percentage points) and a small, statistically significant increase in transfusion use crossing an 8.0 g/dL haemoglobin threshold.

There was no discontinuity in transfusion use across a haemoglobin concentration threshold of 10.0 g/dL (-0.2; 95% CI -0.7–0.3 absolute percentage points). Conclusions: After hip fracture surgery, transfusion based on a haemoglobin threshold of 7.0 g/dL was more common than at guideline recommended 8.0 g/dL or at the liberal threshold of 10 g/dL.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the very short and yet very rich story of a TikTok meme: the rise and fall of the dabloon fictive currency. We examine this story as an example of self-exciting trendiness: a common internet dynamic in which trendiness and cultural vibrancy become inextricably intertwined. In the case of the dabloons and of many other memetic phenomena in TikTok and other platforms, this connection creates a spiraling cycle of popularity that is as potent as it is cursory. TikTokers understood all too well that the dabloon currency was going to be a fad, but, rather than being discouraged by this ephemerality, they pushed it to its extremes. Like many online communities, they doubled down on the transience of their subculture, and did so in the most literal way, using the inflation of their currency to first escalate and then implode the trend. The rise and fall of the dabloon trend offers a cautionary tale about the accelerated cycles of online cultures and internet memes: an illustration of how online communities can create culture not despite but by means of their ephemerality.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives Double-checking medication administrations is one of the most frequently used strategies to prevent errors and associated harm. This practice is time-consuming, introduces repeated interruptions into the care process and lacks evidence of effectiveness. Double-checking is widespread in hospitals worldwide. In England, double-checking happens despite there being no regulatory requirement except for intravenous drugs and medicines that require complex calculations. Many hospital Trusts have assimilated double-checking over the past 25–30 years in response to recommendations from the investigation of medication administration errors. There is currently no national picture in England of the extent to which organisational policies stipulate double-checking, the variation in double-checking policy or how closely double-checking is perceived to be conducted in accordance with policies. This study set out to address these gaps in our understanding. Methods An online survey was distributed to a network of Medication Safety Officers (MSOs) and Freedom of Information requests were sent to 118 English NHS acute hospital Trusts for policies underpinning medicines administration. Data were analysed to address the research questions. Results Policies were received from 94 acute NHS Trusts (80% response rate) and 48 MSOs submitted a survey response (39% response rate). Double-checking policies vary considerably between Trusts. MSOs perceived that it is common in practice for double-checking not to be conducted in accordance with policy. All reviewed Trust policies required double-checking for controlled drugs. Further to this, many required double-checking for specific medicines or in particular circumstances. Most commonly, these were intravenous medicines, medicines administered to children, medicines requiring complex calculations and cytotoxic or chemotherapeutic medicines. However, policies varied considerably around administration of injectable medicines and insulin to adults. A minority of policies specified that ‘intravenous fluids’ needed to be double-checked. Most policies neither emphasised nor explained the importance of the independent nature of double-checking. There was also a great deal of variation between Trust policies in the medicines exempt from double-checking requirements. Conclusions The variation between policies identified by the present study might reflect a lack of robust evidence underpinning the practice of double-checking. Research is needed to understand if double-checking is effective at preventing medication errors and, if it is, the exact circumstances in which it is effective, to facilitate the standardisation of double-checking policies. Identifying circumstances in which double-checking is ineffective may justify the removal of some existing policies and could reduce nurse workload to free up time for patient-focused care.",

This article explores how the concepts of labour neutrality and labour specificity can give access to the self-employed in two contingencies (invalidity and unemployment). First, we explore labour neutrality and specificity from a theoretical perspective. Then, we compare the Dutch and Spanish systems to assess if and how these cover self-employed individuals. Lastly, we conclude with concrete proposals on how labour specificity can contain risks in a neutrally-designed system.",

    "Abstract": "Prison life is often described as inherently painful, including within less punitive prison settings. This study explores the ‘pains of freedom’ in a low-security, or ‘open’, prison context, drawing on extensive fieldwork conducted in Leira, a Norwegian open prison. Although Leira is widely regarded as preferable to other penal settings, the data shows that pains persist, even in low-security institutions that are, in many ways, not very prisonlike. This article challenges the presupposition frequently underlying the ‘pains of imprisonment’ literature, that pains necessarily are only harmful or destructive. Processes of positive change and personal growth will often involve a certain measure of pain or discomfort. Contributing to ongoing theoretical development of the concepts ‘pains of imprisonment’ and ‘pains of freedom’, this study explores whether the pains experienced in open prisons such as Leira can, under the right circumstances, be constructive or transformative. The analysis identifies five aspects – transparency, tolerance, trust, empowerment and engagement – that help residents and staff navigate the ‘pains of freedom’.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate analysis of bolted joint stiffness is critical for assessing the dynamic characteristics of mechanical equipment structures. Under repeated tightening conditions, thread contact stiffness is the predominant factor affecting joint stiffness and structural dynamic response. This study establishes a spring oscillator model for bolted joints incorporating thread contact stiffness. A computational method for asperity stiffness on contact surfaces is developed by integrating Hertz contact theory with a cosine contour model. The thread surface topology is characterized using non-contact 3D laser scanning microscopy, enabling acquisition of high-resolution point cloud data. The analysis of point cloud data reveals a progressive enhancement of contact stiffness with increasing tightening cycles. A hammer-impact modal test is conducted to study the vibration response of the bolted joint structure. The frequency shifts in structural modes reveal the effects of repeated tightening and torque variations on bolted joint stiffness. Experimental validation confirms the consistency between the proposed model and the contact stiffness of bolted joints.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, microwave hybrid heating (MHH) technique was used to prepare full intermetallic compound (IMC) joints. The microstructure evolution, mechanical properties, and fracture mechanisms of the Sn-xNi(x = 10, 20, 30 wt.%) reaction were investigated under different temperatures and holding times. By varying the mass fraction of Ni particles, the optimal ratio for fabricating full IMC joints was determined. The morphology, mechanical properties at room and elevated temperatures, and the effects of high-temperature aging on microstructure, mechanical property, and reliability were also evaluated. The results show that when the Ni mass fraction is 20%, with process parameters of 2 kW microwave power and a 30 min holding time, a full IMC joint was formed, achieving a shear strength of 38.42 MPa. At 350 °C, the shear strength was 32.52 MPa, attributed to the formation of high-melting-point IMCs. Both joints exhibited intergranular fracture, and the fracture surfaces were composed entirely of Ni 3 Sn 4 . Reliability tests showed that the shear strength of the full IMC joint decreased slightly with aging time. After 360 h of aging, the joint strength had decreased by only 8.59%. These indicate that the Ni/Sn-20%Ni/Ni joint maintains good reliability after high-temperature aging.",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates the mechanical and tribological performance of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) and Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG) produced by fused deposition modeling (FDM) and molding under accelerated ultraviolet (UV) and moisture exposure. Specimens were exposed for 300, 600, and 900 h, and changes in microstructure, flexural behavior, surface roughness, hardness, and abrasion resistance were quantified. 3D-printed ABS exhibited the greatest degradation after only 300 h of exposure, with flexural ductility decreasing by more than 27%. A reduction in plowed area of approximately 41% in abrasion testing was consistent with the loss of ductility in the 3D-printed ABS samples. These samples showed poor abrasion resistance, with a debris-to-indentation ratio of about 89% throughout the exposure period. Molded ABS showed minimal degradation in flexural properties; however, it also exhibited poor abrasion resistance, with a debris-to-indentation ratio exceeding 76% after 300 h of exposure. PETG specimens demonstrated higher environmental stability and abrasion resistance in both the 3D-printed and molded forms. Molded PETG maintained the lowest material removal during abrasion, with a debris-to-indentation ratio below 20% throughout the exposure, indicating the highest abrasion resistance. Its hardness increased significantly, by approximately 20% after 300 h of exposure, reflecting UV-induced embrittlement. Molded PETG also exhibited surface microcrack formation after environmental exposure, accompanied by increases in the roughness parameters Ra and Rz and a decrease in surface skewness (Rsk), a shift consistent with the development of microcracks and deeper surface grooves. These results highlight the strong influence of manufacturing method on polymer durability under environmental degradation.",

It explores the influence of an androcentric logic and a neoliberal logic on the production of knowledge in a highly feminised field. Based on interviews with feminist disability researchers and activists in Latin America, we identify three interconnected elements that condition their academic work. These elements are associated with the structural spheres of operation of university institutions. In these institutions, binary gendered practices are (re)produced through the division of labour and the operation of a masculine rationality. There is also a disconnection between the processes of theorisation and the communities involved in them, along with practices of resistance and interruption of some of these dynamics. The results invite us to rethink academic practices from a feminist ethic of care and social justice, recognising and redistributing workloads, valuing emerging forms of knowledge at the frontier between academia and everyday life and contributing to the urgent call for a more inclusive and situated science committed to social transformation.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the aeroacoustic effects of harmonic gust disturbances on a five-blade electric Vertical Take-off and Landing Aircraft (eVTOL) rotor in edgewise flight. Delayed Detached Eddy Simulations (DDES) using OpenFOAM, coupled with a synthetic gust generator, are first validated against experimental results for uniform inflow conditions. The results show good agreement for broadband spectra and performance metrics, with slight underprediction of tonal levels near the blade-passing frequency (BPF). In the next step, the gust of 10% fluctuations relative to the freestream velocity is added to the flow with a frequency of 119 Hz (0.357 BPF). Increasing gust intensity to 30% of the freestream velocity has a negligible effect on mean thrust but raises root mean square (RMS) thrust fluctuations by 14%, compared to 3.9% for the gust with intensity of 10% case. Spectral analysis reveals BPF harmonic increase of 16% and 29% for the intensity of 10% and 30% gusts, respectively, while the gust-frequency response is attenuated. Acoustic results show spatially dependent changes, seen in directivity maps: small gust amplitude enhances BPF levels at most microphones, whereas larger amplitude redistributes noise, broadening high SPL regions but reducing peaks in some directions. Overall Sound Pressure Level (OASPL) shifts range from about −2 to +2 dB, depending on position, indicating that higher gust magnitudes primarily alter noise directivity rather than uniformly amplifying it. These findings highlight the importance of considering high-intensity gusts in vertiport noise assessment and support design strategies for eVTOL operations in gust-prone urban environments.",

While research has richly documented veterans’ lived experiences, far less attention has been given to early indicators that signal academic struggle or persistence. This conceptual article introduces the Veteran Predictive Support Model, a proactive framework that applies Schlossberg's Transition Theory to identify early risk markers among student veterans. Using secondary analysis of a 2024 qualitative dataset (n = 10), the article reframes situational overload, support misalignment, identity strain, and strategy exhaustion as predictive rather than retrospective transition themes. The article also proposes the creation of a Veteran Transition &amp; Success Office, a centralized, academically integrated unit designed to coordinate advising, predictive analytics, and trauma-informed pedagogical practices. Implications for faculty, advising, disability services, and institutional policy are discussed, along with directions for future research.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreaks have affected the global population and demand effective antiviral strategies. Exploring the molecular mechanisms associated with its pathogenesis through modulation of host response is essential for the development of efficient antiviral interventions. Although CHIKV-encoded kinases are not perceived, the phosphorylation of CHIKV proteins in hosts is reported. Hence, elucidating the signaling cross-talks between host kinases and viral proteins provides opportunities for targeted therapeutic strategies. Methods: Toward this, we predicted the phosphosites in CHIKV proteins and their potential host kinases using multiple prediction tools, followed by a human kinase substrate phosphomotif pattern analysis to identify putative kinase interactions. The phosphoproteome of CHIKV and CHIKV-infected host cells and further the host-viral interactome were analyzed in conjunction with kinase inhibition assays to identify host kinases associated with their infection. Subsequently, in silico protein-protein docking was performed between the selected kinases and viral proteins to identify potential interactions. Results and Conclusion: In silico analysis revealed Mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), Protein kinase C alpha (PRKCA), and Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (EEF2K) as major host kinases of specific phosphosites in CHIKV proteins. Putative kinases were also predicted for the reported phosphorylation sites in the CHIKV phosphoproteome. This study reveals that host kinases may phosphorylate substrates critical to CHIKV persistence and pathogenesis and emphasizes the potential of targeting host kinases as an adjunct to antiviral strategies. Our approach demonstrates the utility of kinase substrate specificity modeling to identify host kinases that can interact with viral proteins for their selection as drug-repurposable targets, particularly for variants and viruses without efficient/approved vaccines.",

Nevertheless, information regarding its prevalence and genotypic distribution in farmed foxes ( Vulpes lagopus ) remains limited. Fresh fecal samples ( n = 352) from farmed foxes in northern China were analyzed for P. hominis via nested PCR. The overall prevalence was 15.62% (55/352). Infection rates were 12.09% (22/182) in adults and 19.41% (33/170) in juveniles. The prevalence exhibited seasonal fluctuations, ranging from 10.90% to 25.24%, with the highest prevalence observed in autumn. Foxes with diarrhea exhibited a significantly higher infection rate (33.78%, 25/74) than those without (10.79%, 30/278). Prevalence varied across regions, with the highest rates in Jilin (30.00%, 12/40), followed by Shandong (26.88%, 25/93), Hebei (12.90%, 12/93), Liaoning (6.33%, 5/79), and Heilongjiang (2.13%, 1/47). All positive samples were grouped into the zoonotic CC1 genotype based on phylogenetic analysis. This study offers novel epidemiological insights into P. hominis occurrence among farmed foxes in northern China and underpins the advancement of specific approaches for its detection and control.",

The discussion picks up at the point of wonderment about this difficulty being equivalent to that between language and subjectivity. It identifies the partisan work that normative aesthetics performs in convincing the oppressed that their sense of an inferior racialized subjectivity is innate and unavoidably genuine to their being. It then settles into presenting the ugliness of shame and the desire to quell its unpleasant feelings by aspiring to the normative beauty prescribed by the relentless propagation of established conventions. It is mainly concerned with what it takes to no longer obey the command to use the “war machine” model to achieve Truth.

For instance, a genetic epilepsy syndrome might cause seizures due to cortical hyperexcitability and present with memory impairments arising from hippocampal dysfunction. This study examines how a single disorder differentially affects distinct brain regions using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical- and hippocampal-ganglionic eminence assembloids to model developmental and epileptic encephalopathy 13, a condition arising from gain-of-function mutations in the SCN8A gene encoding the sodium channel Nav1.6. While cortical assembloids showed network hyperexcitability akin to epileptogenic tissue, hippocampal assembloids did not, and instead displayed network dysregulation patterns similar to in vivo hippocampal recordings from epilepsy patients. Predictive computational modeling, immunohistochemistry, and single-nucleus RNA sequencing revealed changes in excitatory and inhibitory neuron organization that were specific to hippocampal assembloids. These findings highlight the unique impacts of a single pathogenic variant across brain regions and establish hippocampal assembloids as a platform for studying neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Amelogenin, the primary protein of the enamel matrix, has long been implicated in regulating crystal nucleation, growth, and spatial organization during tooth development. This study investigates how the absence of amelogenin affects enamel structure and mineralization. Using amelogenin knockout mice, we examine its role in maintaining enamel integrity, modulating ameloblast vesicle dynamics, and facilitating calcium ion transport through specific channels to the enamel surface. The goal is to uncover the mechanistic contributions of amelogenin to enamel biomineralization and its broader implications for dental tissue engineering and pathology. Our study demonstrates that the absence of amelogenin leads to profound disruptions in enamel formation and mineral transport. In amelogenin-null mice, the typical enamel layer was absent and replaced by peg-like, tapered mineral structures. These pegs stained positively for calcium (via alizarin red) and inorganic phosphate (via von Kossa’s method), indicating aberrant mineral deposition. Electron diffraction revealed that the pegs contained bundles of thin, parallel-aligned crystals with patterns consistent with calcium hydroxyapatite, confirming their mineralized nature. At the cellular level, ameloblasts in wild-type mice displayed large, bilayered vesicles (∼200 nm in diameter) at their apical poles, containing inorganic phosphate as detected by modified submicroscopic von Kossa staining. In contrast, amelogenin-deficient ameloblasts lacked both the bilayer membrane structure and phosphate labeling within these vesicles, suggesting disrupted vesicular transport and ion packaging. Further, in vivo calcium labeling with Fluo-4 showed successful apical transport of calcium to the enamel surface in wild-type mice. However, in the absence of amelogenin, calcium was aberrantly retained at the basal ameloblast pole and in the stratum intermedium. This mislocalization correlated with altered expression and distribution of intracellular calcium channel proteins, as shown by immunoreactivity. Together, these findings expand the functional role of amelogenin beyond structural organization during early enamel crystal formation. They reveal a previously underappreciated role in mediating vesicle architecture, phosphate loading, and directional calcium ion transport essential for proper enamel mineralization.",

    "Abstract": "This randomized controlled study aimed to examine the effects of a six-week Differential Learning (DL)-based adaptation of the FIFA 11+ Kids warm-up program on selected physical performance outcomes, including agility, sprint speed, and jump performance in youth male basketball players (mean age = 13.2 ± 0.8 years). A pre-post test design was used, with twenty participants randomly assigned to either a basketball-adjusted FIFA 11+ Kids (BB-adjusted FIFA 11+ Kids) group or a DL-based warm-up group. Bayesian repeated-measures ANOVAs, along with Bayesian independent- and paired-samples t-tests, were conducted to evaluate between- and within-group changes. Between-group analyses showed inconclusive evidence for differences in sprint (BF 10 = 0.41), agility without the basketball (BF 10 = 0.55), agility with the basketball (BF 10 = 0.54), and jump performance (BF 10 = 0.40). Bayesian evidence indicated comparable pre-to-post improvements in both groups across all performance measures. These results suggest that a short-term DL-based warm-up results in comparable performance outcomes to the basketball-adjusted version FIFA 11+ Kids program. Future research should investigate whether extending DL-based approaches beyond an acute warm-up context, such as implementing them across training periods longer than six weeks and including retention testing, affects performance outcomes in youth athletes. In addition, examining different levels and types of variability (e.g., geometric versus dynamic noise) may help clarify context-dependent effects of DL-based warm-ups.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Peripheral nerve injuries can lead to paralysis, sensory loss, chronic pain, and profound psychological and vocational consequences. Recent UK guidelines recommend biopsychosocial rehabilitation, yet qualitative evidence suggest gaps in service provision. This study explored current rehabilitation and perceived barriers among therapists treating adults with peripheral nerve injuries. Methods A cross-sectional online survey was distributed to UK physiotherapists and occupational therapists experienced in upper and lower limb peripheral nerve injury rehabilitation. Questions captured demographics, treatment strategies before and after reinnervation, access to psychological support, and perceived organisational barriers. Descriptive analysis was undertaken. Results Fifty-three respondents (60% physiotherapists, 40% occupational therapists) completed the survey; 70% had more than 10 years’ experience. Ninety eight percent of respondents treated adults with upper limb nerve injuries. Motor and sensory interventions (active and passive range of motion, splinting, strength training, and functional activity) were reported as “always/frequently” used by &gt;80% of respondents. Over a quarter of respondents (28%) occasionally/rarely used pain neuroscience education. Other specific psychological interventions including cognitive behavioural techniques and mindfulness were rarely used (&lt;30% always/frequently). Over half respondents reported no outpatient access to clinical psychology. Organisational barriers included limited time, funding, skilled staff, and absence of local guidelines. However, 83% believed therapists could deliver more psychologically informed care. Conclusions UK rehabilitation for adults with peripheral nerve injuries remains predominantly biomedical, with limited integration of psychologically informed care and limited access to Clinical Psychology. Addressing systemic barriers and evaluating digital or hybrid models may enable more biopsychosocial, patient-centred care.",

    "Abstract": "The ability to grasp objects has a significant impact on the independence of individuals following a stroke, a spinal cord injury, or for those who are living with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In most cases, physical rehabilitation is not sufficient to regain the hand function necessary for day-to-day life. Hand orthoses capable of providing grasping assistance in activities of daily living are therefore crucial to a more independent lifestyle. However, most available options struggle to offer an acceptable balance between cost, size, weight and functionality, resulting in limited use in practice. This article presents a low-cost, 3D-printed hand orthosis that relies solely on mechanical elements to aid in finger flexion. An underactuated, flexible design for the fingers with nylon strips as spring blades was used to achieve a design that costs only 27% of the price of comparable commercially available options, as well as being very lightweight and easily customizable. It was also demonstrated that rigid thumb supports allowed the orthosis to be used in the majority of daily grasping tasks. Finally, the use of the proposed mechanism was shown to be able to provide up to 4 N of flexion assistance to the finger when using a medium wrap grip.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Some centers including ours have used glutaraldehyde-treated pericardium for reconstruction of coronary button defects at the arterial switch operation (ASO). This may impact the incidence of pulmonary stenosis and prevent primary closure of the pericardium. We report a series where 2-ply extracellular matrix (Tyke) was used to reconstruct the neopulmonary root. Methods: Since May 2016, all patients (n = 38) were repaired using Tyke for reconstruction of the coronary button defects. We measured the incidence of pulmonary stenosis and insufficiency at the main pulmonary artery (MPA) and branch pulmonary arteries by echocardiogram and compared these measurements with the historical cohort where pericardium (some treated with glutaraldehyde, some fresh) was used. Results: Mean follow-up was 3.0 ± 2.4 years (range, 1 month to 8 years). The mean gradient at the neopulmonary valve was 6.8 ± 7 mm Hg in the Tyke group versus 23.7 ± 16.1 in the pericardium group ( P &lt; .01). The mean gradient at the distal MPA was 8.9 ± 2.9 mm Hg for the Tyke group and 44.5 ± 40.1 in the historical group ( P &lt; .01). The mean gradient at the proximal left and right branch pulmonary arteries was 29 ± 19 and 32 ± 16 mm Hg in the Tyke group and 33 ± 16 and 36 ± 26 (NSD). At the last follow-up, six of 38 patients (18%) in the Tyke group had a pulmonary reintervention: five patients had a balloon dilation of branch pulmonary arteries, and one patient had dilation of the MPA. No patients underwent surgical intervention on the pulmonary valve or the reconstructed MPA. Conclusion: Tyke is a reasonable alternative material for reconstruction of the coronary button defects during the ASO within the follow-up period.",

    "Abstract": "Background Drawing on more than 30 years of valuable expertise in in-vitro, in-vivo, and clinical trials, we report the key findings of our institutional research on pulsatile cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Methods A detailed search was performed in the National Institutes of Health National Library of Medicine, focusing on the PubMed database. This search combined key terms such as “Pulsatile flow,” “Cardiopulmonary Bypass,” “Undar A,” “Vital Organ Injury,” “Clinical outcomes,” “Pediatrics,” and “Neonates and infants” to find relevant peer-reviewed publications. Results A comprehensive review article was crafted by analyzing 88 peer-reviewed studies published between 1996 and 2025. This research provided substantial scientific evidence on optimizing neonatal and pediatric cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuitry, focusing not only on pump performance but also on selecting appropriate oxygenators and arterial cannulas for effective pulsatile flow. While significant benefits regarding cerebral hemodynamics were observed in neonatal piglet models using pulsatile flow in conjunction with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, the results from randomized clinical trials and retrospective studies raised questions regarding its efficacy. Despite some promising indications of improved Apolipoprotein E and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1/tissue plasminogen activator ratios, a rigorous randomized clinical trial involving 159 patients, along with a comprehensive retrospective study of 284 patients at Penn State Health Children's Hospital, demonstrated no significant clinical advantage of pulsatile flow compared with nonpulsatile flow. Importantly, while pulsatile flow did not provide a measurable benefit, it also did not result in any adverse outcomes in our clinical trials. Conclusions The existing evidence clearly indicates that pulsatile CPB does not provide significant short-term or long-term benefits for pediatric patients undergoing congenital heart surgery.",

    "Abstract": "Although the mobility of climbing robots has made significant progress, especially the flipping climbing robots which possess strong adaptability to unstructured environments, their movement in complex unstructured constrained environments remains a challenge. This work proposes a flipping continuous wall-climbing robot, which maintains the capabilities of wall climbing, turning, obstacle overcoming, and transitioning between different planes. It can continuously move across unstructured wall surfaces, traverse narrow gaps, and crawl on walls in constrained spaces. The robot is composed of a trunk formed by three segments of continuous joint groups and magnetic adhesion modules at both ends, utilizing an untethered design. We conducted an analysis of the robot’s kinematic model and workspace. Experimental results demonstrate that the robot is equipped with multiple basic locomotion abilities, allowing it to execute 360° transitions between surfaces, navigate through apertures measuring 15 cm in diameter (0.37 body length), and move along the side walls of confined spaces that are 11 cm wide (0.27 body length). Additionally, the robot is capable of variable-radius flipping locomotion, supporting an effective payload of 520 g on the wall surface, and facilitating coordinated movement among multiple robots.",

    "Abstract": "To test food, drug formulations, and medical devices, extensive research has focused on developing in vitro gastric simulators. Existing simulators range from rigid mechanical systems to flexible polymer-based designs, each with distinct limitations in replicating the stomach’s complex biomechanical properties. While soft pneumatic actuators provide a foundation for soft robotics-based systems, achieving biomimetic functionality requires control strategies that address both contraction motility precision and compliant interaction dynamics. In this study, we integrate admittance control with finite-time state-dependent Riccati equation (FT-SDRE) and propose a compliant and robust combined force and displacement control for a soft actuator used in robotic gastric simulator. This approach enables a more biomimetic simulation of smooth muscle in gastrointestinal (GI) system when the actuators contact the contents and can help reduce excessive stress on the soft actuator. A three-phase contact model is proposed to describe the force-deformation behavior of the actuator while interacting with the contents, followed by experimental validation. The novel admittance-controlled FT-SDRE enhances both safety and physiological realism in soft tissue interaction. Experimental validation was conducted using three objects: an irregular-shaped gelatin sample, a regular-shaped gelatin sample (same material, different geometry), and an air-filled latex balloon. Compared with nonadmittance FT-SDRE control, the admittance-controlled FT-SDRE reduced 11.19% to 38.46% average contact force according to different objects. Across all tests, the time spent above a force threshold was reduced by 35–39%, which highlights the potential of the proposed method to improve safety, adaptability, and biomimicry in next-generation in vitro gastric simulation platforms.",

    "Abstract": "Study Design Retrospective cohort study. Objectives To update national estimates of in-hospital mortality after lumbar fusion, characterize when deaths occur during hospitalization, and identify independent predictors of mortality. Methods Adult (≥18 years) lumbar fusion hospitalizations in the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) from 2016 to 2022 were analyzed. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included hospital-day timing of death and survivor–decedent comparisons of comorbidity and perioperative complication profiles. Multivariable logistic regression identified independent predictors ( P &lt; 0.05). Results Among 1,181,465 weighted admissions, mortality was 0.11% (1290 deaths) and occurred early (approximately 50% within 7 days; &gt;90% by ∼ 30 days). Decedents more often underwent multilevel fusion (67.8% vs 38.8%, P &lt; 0.001), were aged ≥75 years (41.5% vs 16.5%, P &lt; 0.001), and had higher comorbidity burden (mean Elixhauser count 3.92 vs 2.15, P &lt; 0.001). Independent predictors included age ≥75 years (OR 4.49, P = 0.003), multilevel fusion (OR 2.09, P &lt; 0.001), congestive heart failure (OR 4.46, P &lt; 0.001), coagulopathy (OR 3.44, P &lt; 0.001), neurologic disorders (OR 9.27, P &lt; 0.001), peripheral vascular disease (OR 1.61, P = 0.031), and higher comorbidity count (per-point OR 1.16, P = 0.010). Female sex (OR 0.72, P = 0.022) and highest income quartile (OR 0.58, P = 0.009) were protective. Conclusions In-hospital mortality after lumbar fusion is uncommon but concentrates early and disproportionately affects older, medically complex patients undergoing multilevel procedures, supporting preoperative counseling, front-loaded perioperative risk stratification, and heightened early postoperative vigilance.",

A 2024 live-looping set is analyzed in which archival footage was modularized into audiovisual stems, controlled via tactile interfaces, and layered with improvisation. Methodologically, the article combines practice-based research with ethnographic engagement and remix aesthetics. The RIY 3 (Remix/Recycle/Re-signify It Yourself) framework conceptualizes DIY as a culturally embedded, recursive logic that prioritizes continuity over novelty. In contrast to Global North framings of DIY as leisure-based resistance—rooted in voluntary disengagement and creative subcultures—Mozambican DIY emerges from constraint and cultural inheritance.

Alexander's ‘The civil sphere in war and peace’ (2026), this commentary offers a Hegelian reading of the contradictions that remain unacknowledged within Alexander's model. It argues that the civil sphere rests on a moral framework that externalises contradiction as the uncivil, rather than recognising it as constitutive of its own movement. Further, it shows how the grammar of inclusion in the civil sphere depends on translation into a fixed Western moral code that grants legitimacy only by neutralising otherness, especially in its Global South interlocutors. What presents itself as universal civility therefore constitutes a secret investment in a liberal moral sorting that conceals its internal tensions (such as its inherent patriarchy) and remains perpetually haunted by what it excludes.",

    "Abstract": "This article argues that Harini Nagendra’s “Kaveri and Ramu” series deploys activism as a mode of engagement with, and a strategy for, empowering disenfranchised women and ameliorating systemic crimes in colonial India. Our attention is drawn away from the plots in these novels and recentred on the suffering of marginalized women, both subaltern and elite, in a rigidly patriarchal and colonized milieu. Nagendra does this in two interconnected steps. First, by broadening the role of the detective’s assistant into the diverse “Bangalore Detectives Club”, these works pose a metafictional challenge to the conventional crime novel. Second, the novels redefine seriality in crime fiction through the appearance of club members as recurring characters throughout the series. These narratorial shifts are energized through the figure of Kaveri Murthy — the detective — whose modernity is indexed by her personal and academic accomplishments, her relationship with her husband, her willingness to reformulate domesticity, and her defiance of intransigent caste and religious taboos.",

    "Abstract": "Newly diagnosed mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is commonly treated with rituximab (R) combined with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, with or without autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). While rituximab maintenance (RM) in clinical trials has been shown to prolong overall survival (OS), its impact at population level remains largely unknown. This study evaluates the effect of RM on outcome of patients with MCL. Patients aged ≥18 years diagnosed with MCL between 1989-2020 were identified using the Netherlands Cancer Registry, and categorized into periods reflecting R and RM implementation (1989-2000, 2001-2014, 2015-2020). Treatment strategies were categorized as R-CHOP, R-CHOP followed by high-dose cytarabine (intensive) and ASCT, and other. The primary endpoint was 5-year OS. Multivariable analysis (MVA) was performed using Cox regression. Among 4,751 patients, 5-year relative survival (RS) improved from 38% (1989-2000) to 47% (2001-2014) and 60% (2015-2020) (p&amp;lt;0.01), irrespective of age (≤65 years: 32% and &amp;gt;65 years: 20% increase over time. Patients with progression (POD) within 12 months had 2-year OS of 25%. Since 2014, RM implementation reached 80% in younger and 50% in older patients. RM was associated with improved OS especially for patients in partial remission (PR), after induction treatment with R-CHOP. In MVA patients with R-CHOP, RM was independently associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53 - 0.90). Relative survival in MCL improved by more than 20% over the past 30 years. Early disease progression remains associated with poor outcome. RM was associated with improved survival, especially for patients achieving PR following R-CHOP.",

    "Abstract": "Background: In patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), a critical bleed such as intracranial hemorrhage or bleeding causing hemodynamic instability, requires urgent treatment to rapidly raise the platelet count and restore hemostasis. There is no standardized approach to this hematological emergency. Objective: The McMaster ITP Emergency Management Guideline Group developed evidence-informed recommendations for the management of a critical bleed in adults and children with ITP. Methods: The guideline panel included 5 clinical experts in adult ITP, 3 clinical experts in pediatric ITP, 2 emergency department physicians, 1 emergency department nurse, 2 methodologists, and 4 patient partners. To inform recommendations, the guideline team conducted a multicentre retrospective cohort study and systematic reviews. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to rate the certainty of evidence and GRADE's evidence-to-decision framework to formulate recommendations. Results: Given the life-threatening nature or significant morbidity associated with the condition, despite low or very low certainty evidence, the panel made strong recommendations for the combined use of high-dose corticosteroids, high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), platelet transfusions, tranexamic acid, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) for the treatment of adults or children with a critical ITP bleed. The panel made a conditional recommendation for urgent splenectomy when other treatments have failed and, due to the risk of thrombosis, a conditional recommendation against the use of recombinant factor VIIa. Conclusions: Motivated by the life-threatening nature of the condition, the panel made strong recommendations for the combined use of high-dose corticosteroids, high-dose IVIG, platelet transfusions, tranexamic acid, and TPO-RAs for the emergency management of adults and children with a critical ITP bleed.",

    "Abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon characterized by recurrent episodes of mucosal inflammation. During disease progression, macrophages are recruited into the intestinal lamina propria and polarized toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype, where they exacerbate tissue injury by secreting cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Among these, IL-1β plays a central role, exhibiting both immunomodulatory and pro-inflammatory functions that correlate with disease severity. This study revealed that glycogen metabolism critically regulates IL-1β production and secretion in inflammatory macrophages. Mechanistically, uridine diphosphate-glucose (UDPG), a metabolic intermediate of glycogen metabolism, activates the P2Y<sub>14</sub> receptor, leading to the downstream upregulation of STAT1 expression and enhanced IL-1β production. In parallel, activation of the UDPG-P2Y<sub>14</sub> axis suppresses intracellular cAMP levels, thereby facilitating inflammasome activation and caspase-1 cleavage, ultimately driving IL-1β secretion. Importantly, the glycogen phosphorylase inhibitor ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium induced UC in mice by inhibiting glycogen metabolism. These findings highlight the UDPG-P2Y<sub>14</sub> pathway as a potential therapeutic target for IL-1β-driven inflammatory diseases.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Wheat rust fungi can cause significant damage to wheat crops, leading to reduced yields and economic losses. To combat disease, certain plant varieties can trigger defense responses upon recognition of specific pathogen effector proteins, thereby conferring avirulence. Identifying such avirulence ( Avr ) genes is crucial for developing strategies to protect crops from devastating losses, ranging from identifying matching resistance genes to designing diagnostic assays for monitoring pathogen populations. Puccinia triticina ( Pt ) causes wheat leaf rust and is an obligate biotrophic fungus, and because of its life cycle and mode of reproduction, it is difficult to study genetically. Results To identify Avr genes in Pt , a F 2 population of fifty-seven progeny was generated from a sexual cross of race 9 (SBDG) and race 161 (FBDJ) on the alternate host Thalictrum speciosissimum under controlled conditions. The population segregated for avirulent/virulent traits screened at the seedling stage on thirteen single gene resistance lines in the wheat host cultivar Thatcher background. The genomes of the parents, F 1 , and progeny were sequenced and mapped onto an assembled parental race 9 phased haplotype B genome, resulting in the generation of 21,154 high-quality SNP markers suitable for genetic mapping of the F 2 population. A genetic map composed of 61 linkage groups was obtained, containing a total of 10,923 markers, and spanning 10,730.5 centimorgans. Effector loci correlating with avirulence to specific leaf rust resistance ( Lr ) genes, PtAvrLr14a , PtAvrLr11 and PtAvrLr2a , were mapped to chromosome 1, chromosome 3 and chromosome 4, respectively. To strengthen the identification of candidate Avr genes, a region-specific association study was done on a natural population of fifty-nine Pt isolates that were collected in Canada and whose genomes were sequenced using Illumina. Conclusion Significant markers and corresponding candidate effector genes were identified for these mapped Avr loci. The identification of these candidate genes is an essential step towards cloning Avr and subsequentially their matching host resistance genes, and for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying pathogen-host interactions and host defense.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The nasal cavity serves as a primary contact site and is a common location for colonization by symbiotic, opportunistic, and potentially pathogenic bacteria. Diabetic patients are more susceptible to colonization by opportunistic microorganisms due to impaired immune function, altered normal flora, and increased exposure to healthcare. This study aimed to investigate the nasal colonization of Gram-positive ( Staphylococcus aureus ) and Gram-negative ( Enterobacteriaceae ) bacteria in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals, assessing phenotypic traits including antibiotic resistance and biofilm production, as well as investigating the presence of resistant genes. Materials and methods In this cross-sectional study, nasal swabs were collected from 150 diabetic and 150 non-diabetic individuals. Isolates were identified and evaluated phenotypically (Antibiotic resistance using the disk diffusion method and biofilm formation by the microtiter plate method) and genotypically (resistance genes including mecA , bla CTX , bla SHV , and bla TEM ) by PCR. Results The rate of S. aureus colonization was higher in diabetics (18.7%) than in non-diabetics (12.7%) and MRSA colonization was significantly higher in diabetics (8% vs. 1.3%). High antibiotic resistance was not observed except for tetracycline (nearly 50%) in S. aureus isolates from both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the occurrence of MDR S. aureus between the diabetic (32.1%) and non-diabetic (31.6%) groups. Enterobacteriaceae colonization was 3.3% in diabetics and 7.3% in non-diabetics. Although none were phenotypically ESBL-positive, bla CTX , bla TEM , and bla SHV genes were present in about 40% of the isolates. Conclusion Nasal MRSA colonization was more common among diabetic patients than non-diabetics. The findings of this study highlight the need for ongoing monitoring of nasal colonization of MRSA in different populations and settings, which may lead to the development of effective preventive and therapeutic strategies to control infections caused by nasal colonization.",

    "Abstract": "Salinity tolerance in blackgram is genotype- and growth stage-specific, and the crop is highly susceptible to salinity stress. Therefore, deciphering the tolerance mechanisms of available germplasm is crucial for breeding genotypes with multiple salinity tolerance traits. In this study, a fuzzy logic based comprehensive approach using membership function values (MFVs) was employed to integrate multiple traits involving morphology (root and shoot length and their fresh and dry weights), ion accumulation (sodium and potassium), physiology (SPAD, NDVI, chlorophyll fluorescence, electrolyte leakage, and relative water content), and biochemical parameters (superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, malondialdehyde, chlorophyll, and proline) into a single comprehensive metric for evaluating salt tolerance and to identify promising genotypes. Salinity stress significantly reduced fresh and dry biomass, photosynthetic pigments and related traits, relative water content, and potassium levels, while increasing sodium accumulation, electrolyte leakage, antioxidant enzyme activity, and proline content. Salinity-sensitive genotypes exhibited increased root length and higher sodium ion accumulation across all plant parts. In contrast, tolerant genotypes showed greater photosynthetic efficiency, chlorophyll content, enzymatic activity, higher leaf biomass, and better ion homeostasis throughout the plant. On the basis of principal component analysis (PCA) and membership function values, tolerant (VBG 19010 and VBG 17007) and susceptible (VBG 13003 and ADT 3) genotypes were identified for further molecular dissection. These tolerant genotypes can be used to identify the possible genomic regions and metabolites responsible for salinity tolerance in black gram and serve as valuable resources for crop breeding programs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The Replication Protein A (RPA) is a highly conserved heterotrimeric complex that binds single-stranded DNA and interacts with multiple proteins, playing essential roles in DNA replication, repair, and homologous recombination, thereby maintaining genome stability and supporting normal development. However, the specific members and functions of the RPA gene family remain uncharacterized in maize. Results In this study, 13 ZmRPA members in maize were identified, which exhibited a wide range of protein lengths, from 86 to 876 amino acids. A phylogenetic analysis of these ZmRPA genes revealed their classification into three distinct subgroups: RPA1 , RPA2 , and RPA3 . Notably, within each subgroup, the motifs of ZmRPA proteins were similar, although variations were observed among different subfamilies. An analysis of gene duplication events suggests that RPA genes have remained highly conserved in maize. Furthermore, the analysis of cis-elements indicated that RPA genes are associated with light-responsive, as well as plant growth and development. RNA-seq analysis revealed that some ZmRPA genes exhibited pronounced expression changes under cold and drought stresses, while the results of tissue-specific expression analysis showed that most ZmRPA genes were highly expressed in the actively dividing meristems and reproductive primordia. Protein interaction and yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that ZmRPA family members interact with each other to perform their biological functions. Conclusions Collectively, these findings suggest that ZmRPA family subunits may play important roles in plant growth and development, as well as stress responses, by forming various types of heteromeric complexes through protein interactions. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the RPA gene family in maize and will facilitate further effective characterization of the RPA genes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The efficacy of conventional chemoradiotherapy for colorectal cancer is often limited by resistance, with epithelial-mesenchymal transition being a key mechanism. Although the artemisinin derivative artemether (ARE) has shown antitumor potential, it remains unclear whether it can enhance radiosensitivity and reverse chemo-radiation resistance in colorectal cancer by regulating EMT. This study aimed to investigate the radiosensitizing and resistance-reversing effects of ARE on human colorectal cancer xenografts in nude mice and to elucidate the underlying mechanism related to EMT regulation. Methods A nude mouse xenograft model using human colorectal cancer HCT116 and HCT116-chemo-radiation resistant (HCT116-CRR) cells was established. Results ARE combined with radiotherapy suppressed tumor growth in nude mice and induced cell death via necrosis and apoptosis. After ARE combined with radiotherapy, β-Catenin was increased in human colorectal cancer HCT116 cells implanted in nude mice, while Vimentin was decreased. In HCT116-CRR cells transplanted into nude mice, the E-cadherin and β-Catenin were upregulated, whereas N-Cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, Slug, and Twist were downregulated. ARE effectively significantly enhanced radiosensitivity and reversed chemo-radiation resistance by suppressing EMT. Conclusions These findings provide both mechanistic insights and experimental validation for the potential application of ARE as a radiosensitizer in colorectal cancer radiotherapy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background A majority of adolescents do not meet the recommended levels of physical activity, while reported levels of mental health problems are increasing, and socioeconomic disparities in academic performance are widening. Many schools are implementing physical activity in different forms, but there is inconclusive evidence on what types of interventions improve mental health, cognitive functions, and academic performance and how to implement such interventions. There is a critical need for integrated, feasible, and equitable interventions. The objective of this study is to develop an effective multi-component school-based intervention that will target both physical activity and homework support during an extended school day and evaluate its effects on mental health, cognitive function and academic performance. Methods The study is designed as a cluster-randomised controlled trial with 54 schools and approximately 2,700 students in grade 8 (age 14–15). The intervention includes three weekly 60-minute sessions: (1) Different types of physical activities (2), Homework support with short activity breaks, and (3) Walking and listening to audiobooks. This study will evaluate both outcome effects and implementation process. The primary outcome is anxiety, assessed using the Spence Children’s Anxiety Scale (SCAS-S). Secondary outcomes include physical activity, sedentary time and behaviours measured by accelerometry and questionnaire, cognitive functions assessed by a computer-based test battery, mental health and sleep with questionnaires, and academic performance by grades. Process evaluation will include fidelity, dose, feasibility, acceptability and context, using structured documentation, interviews, focus groups, and observations. The effectiveness of outcomes between groups will be assessed using mixed-effects regression analysis, adjusting for relevant covariates. Process data will be analysed using descriptive statistics and content, and thematic analysis. Discussion This study addresses key knowledge gaps in school-based health promotion by integrating physical activity and homework support within the school structure. The results will yield insights into both effectiveness and implementation, informing future policy and practice in schools to promote health and facilitate students’ learning. The intervention targets youth in diverse socioeconomic contexts and is expected to contribute to reducing health and education inequalities.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Biliary complications (BCs) remain a frequent and clinically important cause of morbidity after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT), with adverse effects on graft function and long-term survival. However, evidence from Central Asia remains scarce. Aim To evaluate the incidence, risk factors, and survival impact of BCs in adult LDLT recipients at a Central Asian centre. Methods This retrospective observational cohort study included 205 adult recipients who underwent living donor liver transplantation between 2011 and 2024. Biliary complications were defined based on combined clinical, biochemical, and radiological criteria. Patients were stratified according to biliary anatomy and reconstruction technique. Risk factors for biliary complications were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Overall survival was assessed using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared between groups using the log-rank test. Results BCs developed in 50 patients (24.4%). Biliary strictures occurred in 27 patients (54.0%), bile leakage in 15 (30.0%), and combined lesions in 8 (16.0%). Multivariate analysis identified male sex (odds ratio [OR] 2.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–4.39; p = 0.045) and multiple bile ducts (OR 2.92, 95% CI 1.33–6.39; p = 0.008) as independent predictors of BCs. Prolonged cold ischaemia time was significant on univariate analysis but not after adjustment. Overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years in the entire cohort was 85.7%, 81.0%, and 78.0%, respectively. Patients with BCs demonstrated reduced long-term survival compared with the overall transplant cohort, with survival rates of 93.3%, 78.3%, and 73.3% at the corresponding time points. Conclusion In this Central Asian LDLT cohort, multiple bile ducts and male sex were independent risk factors for biliary complications, which were associated with poorer long-term survival. Careful preoperative biliary evaluation, preservation of ductal blood supply, and tailored reconstruction techniques are critical to reducing biliary morbidity and improving outcomes following LDLT.",

Although multiple techniques for condylar positioning have been proposed, their impact on postoperative condylar head position and joint space morphology has not been comprehensively assessed. This study aimed to evaluate postoperative changes in condylar head position and temporomandibular joint (TMJ) space using a Procrustes algorithm, and to investigate potential effects of surgeon handedness. Methods A retrospective cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) analysis was conducted on 40 patients (24 female, 16 male) who underwent orthognathic surgery. The cohort comprised 27 patients with Angle Class II and 13 with Angle Class III malocclusion. Eighteen patients underwent bimaxillary procedures, and 22 underwent monomaxillary osteotomies. Condylar position and joint space dimensions were measured, and Procrustes shape analysis was applied to quantify TMJ space deformation. Statistical tests assessed positional changes and correlations with skeletal class, displacement, and surgeon handedness. Results Significant postoperative changes were observed, with a bilateral reduction in cranial distances, reflecting a more caudal condylar head position, and a significant widening of the cranial joint space on the right side. Procrustes analysis confirmed measurable deformation of anterior and posterior TMJ compartments. Condylar heads were frequently positioned dorsally during initial registration, and results suggest that surgeon handedness may systematically influence condylar positioning. Conclusions Postoperative condylar head position and TMJ space morphology are influenced by intraoperative handling, with surgeon handedness emerging as a potential contributor. Incorporating shape analysis methods such as Procrustes algorithms into future digital workflows may improve condylar positioning strategies and enhance surgical outcomes in BSSO.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Heart failure is increasingly common among the elderly, yet many are not referred to specialized care. To better support this group, a co-designed e-health program for patients with heart failure was developed and implemented on Sweden’s national health platform, 1177. Aim To investigate patients and heart failure nurses’ perception of the feasibility of an online support program “Living with Heart Failure”. Methods A feasibility study including interviews with patients and nurses. Four heart failure nurses recruited patients from outpatient clinics in two Swedish regions through convenience sampling. Patients used the program for 12 weeks before being interviewed about its usability, design, features, and content. Nurses were interviewed in a group setting using similar questions. All interviews were analysed using deductive content analysis, and quantitative data described patient characteristics and program use. Results Eleven patients were included, comprising five women and six men, aged 47–84 years (mean 66.8). All had used the program at least once and found the design clear and navigation intuitive. The module content was informative and written in accessible language. They appreciated the variety of content formats. Nurses found the program easy to use and liked the layout but identified limited time as a key barrier to implementation. Conclusion Patients and nurses found the support program feasible regarding acceptability, demand, and practicality. The study also indicated a need for future adjustments and showed that the relevance of the program is not restricted to individuals with newly diagnosed heart failure.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Hypertension (HTN) has been linked to changes in DNA methylation. However, longitudinal epigenome-wide analyses are still limited. Methods We analyzed data from the KORA F4 and FF4 studies, conducted approximately 7 years apart. The dataset included 2614 participants, each with DNA methylation measured at least once. Leucocyte DNA methylation was profiled using the Illumina 450 k and EPIC arrays. Linear mixed-effects models were employed to identify associations between methylation sites and HTN status, systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Interaction terms with follow-up time captured longitudinal methylation trajectories. We further examined CpG sites related to reversed, persistent, or progressive HTN and assessed their correlations with gene expression. Results One CpG site was associated with SBP and four with DBP, all representing novel loci, including RILP (cg08625564) and SVIL (cg15298791). Differential annual methylation changes were observed for 2, 23, and 12 CpG sites by HTN status, SBP, and DBP, respectively, highlighting genes such as RHPN2 , CLDND1 , ZNF69 , and FKBP1B . Twenty CpG sites were associated with persistent HTN, including PLCB2 and MPPE1 . In whole blood, 22 significant CpG–transcript pairs were detected, involving 14 CpG sites and 19 gene transcripts. Conclusions This longitudinal epigenome-wide study identified novel CpG sites associated with blood pressure and persistent HTN. We observed differential DNA methylation trajectories over time linked to HTN, SBP, and DBP, with several changes correlating with gene expression, suggesting functional relevance. These findings underscore the dynamic role of DNA methylation in blood pressure regulation and provide new insights into epigenetic mechanisms of HTN. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Influenza A virus remains a persistent threat, continuously evolving and contributing to seasonal epidemics and potential pandemics. In this study, we analyzed clinical samples collected from pediatric patients in Shanghai between 2022 and 2023, following the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to assess the genetic diversity of circulating influenza A virus strains. Out of 88 clinical samples that were positive for influenza A virus, seven isolates were successfully cultured and subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing was performed using the Illumina high-throughput sequencing platform, while missing genomic segments, which were identified in the whole-genome sequence of isolates, were later amplified via standard PCR and Sanger sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a significant divergence between H3N2 strains from 2023 to those from 2022, suggesting a potential decline in vaccine efficacy over successive seasons. A H1N1 strain isolated from 2022 exhibited close genetic similarity to the vaccine strain. Mutational analysis identified key substitutions in the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase regions, including the I222V mutation in the neuraminidase segment of sample B623080303, which is associated with strong resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir. Another highly drug-resistant N206D mutation in the hemagglutinin region, detected in four clinical isolates, was found to alter host specificity by reducing binding affinity to human-like α2,6-linked receptors while increasing affinity for avian-like α2,3-linked receptors, thereby influencing host adaptation dynamics. The findings provide critical insights into the evolutionary trends of influenza A virus strains post-COVID-19 pandemic and their potential implications for vaccine effectiveness and antiviral resistance.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Wild edible plants are critical for local nutrition, cultural heritage, and livelihoods, yet their diversity and traditional uses are underexplored in Pakistan. Swat Valley, a biologically and culturally rich region, relies on wild plants for food security, particularly among economically vulnerable households. Methods Field surveys were conducted from 2018 to 2022 across 20 villages in six tehsils of Swat District. A total of 160 informants (100 males, 60 females; aged 20–90 years) were interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires, in-depth interviews, and personal observations. The quantitative ethnobotanical indices, including (UV), (RFC), and (UR), were calculated to assess cultural importance and usage patterns. Results A total of 175 wild edible plant species from 72 families were documented. Herbs dominated ( 62.3% ) , followed by shrubs (20.6% ) , trees ( 16% ) , and climbers (1.1% ). Young shoots ( 41.7% ) , fruits ( 30.6% ) , and leaves ( 13.9% ) were most commonly used. Plants were used as vegetables ( 37% ) , fruits ( 39% ) , raw foods ( 14% ) , teas/flavoring agents ( 5% ) , sauces/chutneys (2% ) , and oils ( 2% ). Berberis lycium showed the highest cultural importance (UV = 0.813, RFC = 0.75), followed by Chenopodium album (UV = 0.68, RFC = 0.63) and Berberis vulgaris (UV = 0.65, RFC = 0.63). Novel use analysis of 115 species revealed High Level (22%), Moderate Level (23%), and Low Level (55%) novelty. Twenty-seven species were marketed locally, generating income ranging from (0.09 to 1.74 $) per Kg. Conservation assessment highlighted Endangered species ( Abies pindrow , Mentha royleana , Zanthoxylum armatum ) and Vulnerable species ( Thymus linearis , Mentha longifolia , Morus alba ). Conclusion Wild edible plants in Swat Valley provide essential nutrition, support local livelihoods, and sustain cultural traditions. Quantitative indices demonstrate the most culturally significant species and highlight gaps for conservation. Sustainable management, cultivation, and policy interventions are recommended to preserve these vital resources, ensuring biodiversity conservation and continued food security in mountainous regions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Hookworms (Ancylostomatidae) significantly impact on the health of both domestic animals and humans worldwide, with some species capable of causing zoonotic diseases. While hookworm infections in pets are frequently reported in Europe primarily through coproscopic studies, there are limited data regarding their presence in wild carnivores. To address this, this study aimed to assess the diversity, prevalence, and distribution of hookworms in wild canids and felids from Romania through both morphological and molecular analyses. Methods From November 2011 to February 2025, 319 carcasses belonging to six species of wild canids and felids from Romania [23 gray wolves ( Canis lupus ), 137 golden jackals ( Canis aureus ), 79 red foxes ( Vulpes vulpes ), 2 raccoon dogs ( Nyctereutes procyonoides) , 70 European wildcats ( Felis silvestris ), and 8 Eurasian lynxes ( Lynx lynx )] were collected as road kills or legally hunted. Hookworms were recovered from the intestinal tract during necropsy and preserved in formalin for morphological examination and in absolute ethanol for genetic analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted and analyzed using a PCR targeting a barcode region of the second nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2), followed by sequencing. Sequencing results were compared with other entries from GenBank™. Results The overall hookworm infection rate was 14.1%, with hookworms detected in 4 wolves (17.4%), 23 golden jackals (16.8%), 11 European wildcats (15.7%), 4 red foxes (5.1%), 2 raccoon dogs (100%), and 1 lynx (12.5%). Three hookworm species were identified: Uncinaria stenocephala , Ancylostoma caninum , and A. tubaeforme . Molecular analysis revealed 14 unique sequences, comprising nine haplotypes of U. stenocephala , three of A. caninum , and two of A. tubaeforme . We report for the first time the Eurasian lynx as a host for A. caninum , expanding the known host range of this species. Conclusions This study provides the first comprehensive molecular assessment of hookworm diversity in European wild carnivores, showing new host–parasite associations and highlighting the importance of these hosts as reservoirs for domestic pets and, potentially, humans. The detected haplotypes showed high similarity to isolates from Europe, Asia, and the Americas, indicating a broad global connectivity of hookworm populations. Graphical abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Following the positive outcomes of the Clarity-AD trial, Lecanemab received marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and is expected to become available across Europe. However, the trial did not specifically evaluate frailty, making it difficult to estimate the potential effects of Lecanemab among frail individuals. This study aimed to apply Lecanemab eligibility criteria—based on both the Clarity-AD trial and the Appropriate Use Recommendations (AUR) from the United States and France—to a real-world population of pre-frail and frail older adults with confirmed positive amyloid status, and to evaluate differences in frailty status between eligible and non-eligible patients. Methods Eligibility criteria from the Clarity-AD trial, the American and the French AUR, were applied to all participants with confirmed amyloid positivity ( n = 120), assessed through amyloid-PET (visual reading) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (Aβ42 levels or Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio). Frailty was defined using the Fried phenotype. Results The median age of the sample was 82.0 years (IQR: 79–85); 65% ( n = 78) were women, and 36.7% ( n = 44) were frail. Overall, 20.0% ( n = 24) met the Clarity-AD eligibility criteria, while 50.8% ( n = 61) and 47.5% ( n = 57) were potentially eligible according to the American and French AURs, respectively. Only 9.1% ( n = 4) of frail individuals met the Clarity-AD criteria, compared to 26.3% ( n = 20) of pre-frail participants ( p = 0.042). In contrast, 50.0% ( n = 22) and 45.5% ( n = 20) of frail individuals were potentially eligible according to the American and French AURs, respectively. Conclusion Although less than one in five participants would have been eligible for the Clarity-AD trial, approximately half the cohort would be potentially treatable with Lecanemab under real-world recommendations. While a considerable proportion of frail patients may have access to Lecanemab treatment in real-life, the low proportion of potentially eligible frail individuals for Clarity-AD in our cohort indirectly suggests that frailty may have been underrepresented in the trial, raising concerns about the generalizability of its findings to this population. Caution is warranted when targeting amyloid burden without previously addressing the underlying frailty. Trial registration NCT03129269.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Understanding the dynamics of species and functional diversity and their interrelationships during vegetation restoration is essential for assessing the effectiveness of ecosystem restoration. Yet, the mechanistic links between species diversity and functional diversity during vegetation restoration remain uncertain, with community-level functional traits likely mediating this relationship. Methods We studied a chronosequence of Artemisia ordosica -dominated dryland communities, including semi-fixed (D1), fixed (D2), soil-biocrusted fixed (D3), and shrub-herbaceous-fixed sand-dunes (D4). Thirteen leaf functional traits were measured, including leaf tissue density (LTD), and leaf dry matter content (LDMC). Community-weighted mean leaf functional traits (CWM-LFTs) were calculated using importance value-weighted averages. Results Species and functional diversity increased progressively from stages D1 to D4, with the coefficient of variation for CWM-LFTs ranging from 7.71% to 57.27%. Changes in species diversity during sand dune stabilization were linked to a strategy of slow growth and cumulative increases in LTD, LDMC, and leaf carbon content (LCC), improving the community’s physical defense and nutrient retention. Leaf structural traits mirrored diversity patterns, with LDMC most strongly linked to functional evenness, functional divergence and Rao’s quadratic entropy. Conclusions Our results show that both species and functional diversity increased progressively with sand-dune stabilization. The plant community followed a trajectory of increasingly complex strategies, shifting from stress-tolerant traits toward competition-adapted traits in later stages. The LDMC was strongly correlated with both species and functional diversity, serving as a key trait that mediates competitiveness and defense in resource-limited ecosystems. These findings highlight the importance of trait-based assembly in vegetation restoration and offer new insights for desertification control.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Automobiles are ubiquitous in the modern world, and chemicals leaching from car tires and from the tire wear particles produced during driving can be toxic to the environment, particularly in aquatic ecosystems. 6PPD-Quinone (6PPD-Q), a recently identified tire and tire wear particle leachate, has been identified as highly toxic to coho salmon and other aquatic species. Research on the distribution and impacts of 6PPD-Q in aquatic ecosystems is rapidly developing, while research on 6PPD-Q in other environmental media is just beginning. With research efforts developing on many fronts, there is a need to better map emerging knowledge about this toxin. To do that, we ask the question: “What research exists on the presence of the 6PPD-Q in different environmental media (water (freshwater), soil, sediment, and air, including dust)?” The ultimate purpose of this systematic map is to generate a literature catalog that serves as a searchable database about 6PPD-Q in different environmental media. Methods The systematic map will follow the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence guidelines and conform to the Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Syntheses (ROSES). Relevant English language only literature searches will use a search string using the specified Boolean description of our PECO elements (Population: Environmental media water, soil, sediment, air: including dust; Exposure: N/A; Comparator: N/A; Outcome: The presence of 6PPD-Q/ The concentration of 6PPD-Q). Two bibliographic databases, Web of Science (WOS) Core Collection and ScienceDirect, will be searched. Additional literature will be located through searches of targeted search engines and specialist websites. Screening of titles, abstracts, and full texts will be completed in series using established eligibility criteria. The results of the systematic map will contain a searchable open-access database formatted in Microsoft Excel. Furthermore, the outcome will be presented in a global map of the geographical distribution of included studies and their PICO/PECO elements, including a narrative synthesis, descriptive statistics, tables, and figures.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Bronchial challenge testing with methacholine was applied to evaluate and quantify bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in asthma patients. We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness between methacholine chloride and methacholine for methacholine challenge testing (MCT) in clinical practice, and investigate the adverse events associated with methacholine chloride. Methods Patients who received methacholine and inhaled methacholine chloride for MCT were included in this retrospective study. All participants completed pulmonary function tests and MCT between January 2022 and February 2024. The provocative dose of methacholine that results in a 20% fall in FEV 1 (PD20-FEV 1 ) was used as quantitative measure of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The primary outcome of the study was the proportion of positive MCT results and the degree of BHR, while the secondary outcome was the incidence rate of respiratory adverse events during methacholine chloride administration. Results A total of 17,352 participants were included. In patients with bronchial symptoms, those administrated methacholine chloride for MCT demonstrated a significantly higher percentage of positive results compared with those administrated conventional methacholine (36.7% vs. 30.8%, P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, PD20-FEV 1 values were significantly lower in methacholine chloride group than methacholine group ( P &lt; 0.001). Chest tightness was the most prevalent adverse symptom affecting 30.8% of patients who received methacholine chloride, followed by cough at 27.2%. No serious adverse events were reported in these patients. Conclusions The data indicated that methacholine chloride yielded a higher positive test rate than methacholine in MCT. Given that only mild adverse symptoms of chest tightness and cough were observed, with no serious adverse events reported, it represents a safe and effective alternative for clinical BHR assessment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Exosomes are crucial mediators of intercellular communication. As a key component of milk, milk-derived exosomes are abundant in genetic cargo, particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), indicating their potential role in regulating mammary gland physiology. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the specificity of miRNAs in milk-derived exosomes and their regulatory roles in lipid synthesis in bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs). Results Based on 17,838 DHI records showing a significantly higher milk fat percentage (MFP) in late lactation (4.24% ± 1.07%), 10 high- (5.96% ± 0.26%, HMF) and 10 low-MFP (1.68% ± 0.23%, LMF) cows were selected during this stage for milk-derived exosome isolation and miRNA profiling. Exosomes isolated via differential ultracentrifugation were verified as 50–150 nm vesicles expressing CD9, CD81, and TSG101. miRNA sequencing identified 1,320 differentially expressed miRNAs (496 upregulated and 824 downregulated) between the HMF_EXO and LMF_EXO groups. Uptake assays confirmed that BMECs internalized these exosomes, and qRT-PCR validation showed that miR-423-5p and miR-125b were significantly upregulated and downregulated in HMF_EXO- and LMF_EXO-treated BMECs, respectively. Functionally, exosomal miR-423-5p promoted intracellular lipid accumulation and TG synthesis in BMECs by targeting APOA5 , whereas miR-125b inhibited lipolysis and fatty acid oxidation by repressing SLC27A1 . Conclusions This study demonstrates that milk-derived exosomal miRNAs represent a novel mechanism for regulating milk fat synthesis. Specifically, miR-423-5p and miR-125b directly modulated lipid metabolism in BMECs via the miR-423-5p/ APOA5 and miR-125b/ SLC27A1 pathways. These findings provide new insights into the molecular regulation of milk fat synthesis and highlight the importance of exosome-mediated intercellular communication in the lactating mammary gland.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Tricholoma matsutake (TM), a prized wild mushroom in Eurasia, hosts distinct microbiomes in its mycorrhizal zone (shiro), with some microbes known to benefit TM. However, no study has systematically compared shiro-inhabiting microbiomes across multiple studies from either taxonomic or functional perspectives. Results We first compiled bacterial and fungal amplicon sequences from public and newly generated datasets, then applied phylogenetic tree-based clustering to integrate technically heterogeneous sequences. This enabled the identification of core microbial phylotypes conserved in shiro from geographically diverse regions. We also revealed niche-specific phylotypes within the shiro, distinguishing those associated with soil, TM-colonized root, and fruitbody, thereby demonstrating clear niche differentiation. Functional predictions and experimental validation highlighted key roles of the microbes in degradation of aromatic compounds, utilization of plant-derived compounds, and fruitbody development. Conclusions Our cross-study integration of shiro microbial sequences identified core and niche-specific phylotypes with distinct ecological roles. This study lays a foundation for advancing ecological research and cultivation strategies for TM.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background There has been considerable research interest in the personality characteristics and mental health of individuals showing excessive levels of celebrity admiration. However, the conceptualization and measurement of potentially problematic levels of engagement with celebrities remain unclear. This study introduces and operationalizes the concept of problematic celebrity fanship within the theoretical framework of behavioral addictions. The main aim is to develop a measurement instrument to assess problematic celebrity fanship. Methods Participants were 755 individuals with a favorite celebrity (51.4% men, M age = 36.4 years, SD = 13.4), derived from a representative sample of Hungarian adults ( N = 2,028). Results The 8-item unidimensional Problematic Celebrity Fanship Scale (PCFS) demonstrated sound psychometric properties across factor structure, measurement invariance, reliability, and validity. Based on latent profile analysis, a cutoff score of 26 was suggested. Prevalence rate for problematic celebrity fanship was 1.4% (adults aged 18–64 years); however, young adults (aged 18–34 years) showed a higher, 2.3% prevalence. Problematic celebrity fanship severity was moderately associated with psychological distress, lower self-concept clarity, problematic Internet use, and celebrity worship. Conclusions The PCFS can assist in the recognition and assessment of problematic celebrity fanship in research and practice by identifying individuals experiencing mental health difficulties in relation to their excessive engagement with a celebrity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study looks at the challenges and support related to implementing Open Educational Resources policies in Ethiopian universities. It focuses on how institutional, technological, and cultural factors influence progress toward smart learning environments. Based on theories of policy implementation and innovation diffusion, the research used a qualitative method. This involved analyzing documents and conducting semi-structured interviews with academic leaders, deans, and information and communication technology coordinators from six public universities with different types of institutions. The findings reveal considerable differences in awareness of open educational resource policies, the readiness of digital infrastructure, and faculty involvement. These differences point to variations in technological capacity and governance. While national policy frameworks lay a foundation, weak institutional translation, limited incentives, and a lack of technical and teaching support impede adoption. Conversely, emerging communities of practice, external partnerships, and committed leadership act as important supports. The study concludes that effectively implementing open educational resource policies needs integrated strategies. These strategies should improve institutional governance, provide appropriate incentives, invest in lasting digital infrastructure, and incorporate open resources into teaching methods focused on learners. These insights contribute to national reform efforts and global discussions on promoting inclusive, adaptive, and sustainable smart learning environments in developing areas.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Sepsis-induced immunosuppression impairs bacterial clearance and increases mortality. Liver and spleen macrophages are an essential part of the mononuclear phagocyte system and crucial for bacterial elimination. Systemic inflammation hampers bacterial clearance in the liver. We hypothesized that immunosuppression due to systemic inflammation might lead to decreased bacterial clearance by the spleen. Methods Anesthetized pigs were subjected to an E. coli infusion for three hours in an intensive care setting. The Naive group only received the bacterial infusion ( n = 10). The ETX group ( n = 10) received an endotoxin infusion for 24 h, inducing systemic inflammation before the E. coli infusion. The Control group ( n = 3) received saline instead of endotoxin for 24 h to study the effects of anesthesia alone. Bacterial counts and endotoxin levels were analyzed during the E. coli infusion. The levels of IL-6 and TNF were analyzed, and the piglets’ physiological response was evaluated. Results There was no difference in the bacterial counts in the artery, splenic vein or hepatic vein. However, the splenic venous to arterial bacterial counts ratio at 1–3 h was lower in Naive compared to ETX group (0.54 (0.34–1.07), 0.54 (0.20–0.85), 0.52 (0.21–0.64) vs. 0.77 (0.61–1.06), 0.85 (0.63–0.89), 0.74 (0.53–0.88); p &lt; 0.01), but there was no difference in the animals’ blood ex vivo bactericidal capacity. There was no difference in endotoxin clearance in the spleen between the groups. The peak log IL-6 and TNF levels in response to the E. coli infusion were higher in the Naive compared to the ETX group (3.40 ± 0.41 vs. 2.94 ± 0.43 pg × mL −1 and 3.78 ± 0.68 vs. 2.23 ± 0.36 pg × mL −1 ; p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). The respiratory, circulatory and metabolic response to the E. coli infusion was dampened in the animals pre-exposed to endotoxin. Conclusion The splenic bacterial clearance is impaired by pre-existing systemic inflammation, while differences in endotoxin elimination were not detected. The inflammatory and physiological response to bacteremia is diminished during ongoing inflammation. Since the animals’ ex vivo bactericidal capacity was not affected by pre-existing inflammation, our results suggest that inherent mechanisms in the spleen were involved.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Through an examination of the apprenticeship system within the hairdressing industry in Song County, Shandong Province, this study finds that, since the 1990s, the master-apprentice relationship has gradually shifted from a quasi-family relationship to a quasi-employment relationship , transitioning from a foundation of qing (情; affection) to one of li (利; profit). This study employs a yi-li-qing (义-利-情; obligation- profit- affection) analytical framework to analyze the dynamics within this shifting master-apprenticeship relationship. The quasi-family relationship is essentially an affection-based relationship with genuine obligation and subdued utility, where ethical guidelines for master-apprentice identities are emphasized, emotional connections from sustained interaction are valued, and demands for profit are relatively minor. In contrast, the quasi-employment relationship represents an instrumental relationship where profit-oriented interests are becoming the standard and goal of interaction, while ethical norms and affectional bonds play only a limited regulatory role. Compared to a sentiment-instrumentality dual framework, the yi-li-qing framework provides a more comprehensive depiction of the intrinsic attributes of guanxi , illustrating the dynamics and complexities arising from shifts in the social structure.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Calcium phosphate cement (CPC) demonstrates excellent shape retention; however, the material exhibits a prolonged resorption period. Despite its inferior mechanical strength and poor shape retention, beta-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP) offers excellent osteoconductivity. We previously reported that incorporating β-TCP into CPC enhances mechanical strength and shape retention. However, the prolonged setting time poses a challenge for clinical application. We aimed to improve the clinical usefulness of the CPC/β-TCP composite material. Materials and methods Samples with different mixing ratios of β-TCP (SUPERPORE) to quick-setting type of CPC (BIOPEX ® -R Quick Type) (C0, C10, C30, and C50 with mixing ratios of β-TCP of 0, 10, 30, and 50 wt%, respectively) were prepared. We evaluated the material properties. New bone formation was evaluated by histological and histopathological analysis after 4 and 8 weeks of implantation into the calvarial bone of Wistar rats. Results This material was set in approximately 4 min. As the β-TCP content increased, the compressive strength decreased significantly. The average compressive strength C30 was 1.5 MPa. Penetration tests confirmed good permeability for C30 and C50. In the histological study, better new bone formation was observed in the C30 and C50 at 4 and 8 weeks. Conclusion These results suggested that the composite material made in this study had a shorter setting time and improved penetration than that in the previous study and confirmed its biocompatibility and osteoconductivity. Its compressive strength was low; therefore, it is necessary to examine whether the material can withstand the vertical and horizontal augmentation of the jawbone.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study examines the impact of fintech-driven financial inclusion on bank risk-taking behavior. We analyze unbalanced panel data from 660 banks across 40 developing countries between 2011 and 2021. Our findings derived from pooled OLS regression suggest that financial inclusion facilitated by fintech significantly reduces various types of bank risks: default risk decreases by 7.85%, leverage risk decreases by 9.23%, and portfolio risk decreases by 7.64%. These reductions are observed in the context of emerging mobile, internet, and agent banking services. The extent of these reductions varies depending on bank type, size, concentration, the institutional quality of the country, and different geographical regions. Our results remain consistent across multiple proxies and robustness tests, including panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE) estimation, two-stage least squares-instrumental variable (2SLS-IV) regression, two-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation, and quantile regression (QR). However, the transformation toward fintech comes with significant challenges, such as large-scale investments, the need for financial literacy, and consumer protection—issues that policymakers, regulators, and financial institutions must address.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Perceived dominance, which can be formed on the basis of the facial features of a chief executive officer (CEO), can affect the behavior of other firm members (i.e., other executives and subordinates) and impact corporate outcomes. However, a consensus has yet to be reached on the association between CEO perceived dominance and corporate financial performance owing to limitations in sample representativeness, measurement errors, and empirical strategies of previous studies. This study investigates the impact of CEO perceived dominance on corporate financial performance through facial feature extraction via deep learning, which can provide robust and causal insights from a large dataset spanning a long time period of 30 years. Furthermore, this study explores the mechanism of the impact of CEO perceived dominance from the perspective of information flow and sharing by investigating the moderating effects of CEOs’ nonsalary compensation, board size, and the number of business segments. The results indicate that the degree of CEO perceived dominance is negatively associated with corporate financial performance and that a CEO’s high nonsalary compensation, large board size, and large number of business segments can attenuate the negative association. Our findings can deepen the theoretical understanding of the impact of CEO perceived dominance on corporate financial performance and provide managerial implications for the decision-making of investors.",

The second issue, a theoretical contribution, is to show that important roles played by non-elite actors in the ongoing construction of collective identity can be submerged by “Western” perspectives used to study religious communities and by disproportionate attention paid to macro-structural factors. This paper is produced through a deferred, reflexive interpretation of qualitative data and demonstrates how “ordinary” individuals in Hyderabad, India, play extraordinarily critical roles in shaping their religious communities and collective identity, both in the eyes of in-groups and out-groups. This paper argues that collective identities are constructed, maintained, and reconstructed not only by macrostructural processes, the state, and elites, but equally by mundane actions embedded in the everyday lives of ordinary individuals.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Transgenic cotton producing toxins derived from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is used globally to manage insect pests, including the pink bollworm, Pectinophora gossypiella , one of the most damaging pests of cotton. The use of Bt cotton, which produces either a single Bt Cry toxin (Cry1Ac) or two Cry toxins (Cry1Ac + Cry2Ab), has sustained susceptibility and successfully managed pink bollworm in both China and the United States. In contrast, pink bollworms in India have evolved practical resistance to Bt cotton producing Cry1Ac or Cry1Ac + Cry2Ab. Recent studies suggest that pink bollworm may have similarly evolved resistance to transgenic Bt cotton in neighboring Pakistan. Results Field trials of non-Bt cotton, four Cry1Ac Bt cotton varieties, and six Cry1Ac + Cry2Ab Bt cotton were assessed for pink bollworm infestation and damage in Pakistan in 2020 and 2021. High levels of infestation in flowers and bolls, as well as cotton seed yield loss were observed in all the tested cultivars. Only one Bt cultivar producing Cry1Ac + Cry2Ab (MNH-1045) showed a significant reduction in pink bollworm infestation and protection from seed damage, although it was not entirely resistant to pink bollworm attacks. Conclusion Cotton plants were determined to produce both Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab proteins, albeit at relatively low levels, indicating that pink bollworm populations in Pakistan may not encounter effective toxin concentrations and/or may be exhibiting field-evolved resistance to these toxins. Immediate action is needed to manage this important pest of cotton.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis are the two best-known cryptanalysis techniques for symmetric-key primitives. Ensuring resistance to these attacks is critical for the security of block ciphers. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between differential/linear clustering effect and the number of active S-boxes in the intermediate rounds. Our findings indicate that an increase in the number of active S-boxes in the intermediate rounds does not inherently lead to an evident improvement in EDP/ELP. Instead, the EDP/ELP remains stable once the number of active S-boxes exceeds a certain threshold. We apply our method to four lightweight SPN primitives including GIFT-64, PRESENT, RECTANGLE and KNOT-256. For GIFT-64, RECTANGLE, and KNOT-256, we obtain improvements in the best known linear propagation results, while our other results are consistent with the best known results.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Changing fire regimes and climate conditions have decreased postfire conifer regeneration densities in many ecosystems across Western North America. In the Southern Rocky Mountains, sparse postfire regeneration of conifers has often been accompanied by abundant regeneration of quaking aspen, much of which is from vegetative resprouting. While aspen also produces abundant lightweight seed that can disperse great distances, we know considerably less about the patterns and drivers of postfire establishment of aspen from seed. To understand the potential for severe fire to catalyze shifts to aspen-dominated forests, we studied conifer-dominated forests that burned at high severity and asked: (1) how does postfire regeneration of conifers and aspen vary across sites? (2) how are aspen and conifer seedlings distributed within sites? and (3) how do site and microsite conditions influence aspen seedling establishment? To answer these questions, we conducted field surveys at 32 sites within the burn scar of the Cameron Peak fire, northwestern Colorado. Results Two years following fire, we found widespread but highly variable establishment of aspen seedlings, despite the absence of aspen in the pre-fire stand. Aspen seedlings were more likely to occur at higher elevations, where they were often clustered within concave microsites with bryophyte substrates and near large CWD. Further, we found aspen seedlings often outnumbered conifer seedlings and occurred within the same local neighborhood as conifer seedlings. Conclusions Increased fire frequency, severity, and extent in Western North America may exceed the capacity of some formerly conifer-dominant forests to maintain historical distributions, while conditions following high-severity burns may allow for aspen seedling establishment and the expansion of aspen populations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Cognitive impairment (CI) affects approximately one-third of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), underscoring the need for accessible predictors. Interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) abnormalities have been proposed as potential indicators of cognitive dysfunction; however, their independent diagnostic utility is unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between interictal EEG patterns and CI in adults with DRE, with a specific focus on evaluating their incremental predictive value beyond established clinical predictors. Methods In this cross-sectional study of 90 adults with DRE were recruited over a six-month period. Participants were stratified into two groups based on their Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA): those with cognitive impairment (Cases; n = 45; MoCA &lt; 26) and those with preserved cognition (Controls; n = 45; MoCA ≥ 26). All participants underwent routine interictal scalp EEG, An EEG recording was classified as abnormal if epileptiform discharges or significant background slowing was identified. The relationships between cognitive status and various clinical variables-including age, monthly seizure frequency and epilepsy type were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression, with expressed as odds ratios alongside their 95% confidence intervals. Results The frequency of monthly seizures was significantly higher in the CI group compared to the control group (9.6 ± 2.8 vs. 5.4 ± 2.1 seizures/month, P &lt; 0.001). Interictal EEG abnormalities were also more prevalant in CI group (77.8% vs. 57.8%; OR = 2.56, 95% CI: 1.02–6.41, P = 0.041). However, in the adjusted multivariable model, only seizure frequency reained a signifcant independent association with CI (adjusted OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.32–0.65, P &lt; 0.001), indicating that EEG abnormalities did not confer significant additional predictive power after accounting for seizure burden. Conclusions Seizure burden emerged as the predominant predictor of CI with DRE, while interictal EEG abnormalities demonstrated a univariate correlation with cogntive status, this association was not independent in the adjusted analysis. EEG findings may still provide contextual or supportive clinical context, emphasize that a comprehensive approach integrating seizure management with cognitive assessments is warranted, rather than relying primarily on interictal EEG for cognitive risk stratification.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The one-equation Spalart–Allmaras (SA) model is employed to close the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes equations (RANS equations), and research on turbulent numerical algorithm is carried out. Using the coordinate transformation based on the characteristic line, we can obtain RANS equations without the convection terms. The intermediate velocity and correct velocity terms are introduced to split the momentum equations. The Runge–Kutta method is used to discretize it in time, and the Taylor expansion along the characteristic line is used to overcome the mesh update difficulty due to the coordinate transformation. Finally, based on the Galerkin space discretization, a third-order characteristic-based-split finite element algorithm is proposed. Numerical simulation of turbulent flow past a square cylinder is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The prosposed algorithm is applied to simulate turbulent flow past a single conductor and 4-bundled conductors with crescent-shaped ice, the aerodynamic coefficients for different ice thicknesses and wind attack angles are obtained, and the galloping stability of crescent-shaped ice-covered conductor is discussed.",

This case–control study investigates soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), a protein bridging inflammation and neural repair, as a novel biomarker candidate among Egyptian patients with BD. Methods We compared 48 BD patients (DSM-5- diagnosis, confirmed via SCID-5-CV) and 48 age-/sex-matched controls. Sociodemographic data were collected from all participants using a standardized questionnaire, with additional clinical variables assessed exclusively in the bipolar disorder group. Symptom severity was assessed using Arabic-validated Hamilton Depression (HDRS-17) and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Fasting serum suPAR levels were quantified via ELISA. Results BD patients showed significantly lower suPAR versus controls, without significant associations with key clinical characteristics (as hospitalization, suicidality). ROC analysis identified suPAR ≤ 110.113 ng/ml with an optimal diagnostic cutoff (AUC = 0.758), with 83.3% sensitivity, 60.4% specificity, and 71.9% accuracy. Conclusions Reduced suPAR represents a potential trait biomarker in BD, reflecting impaired neural regeneration rather than episodic symptoms. It may have a clinical utility for early detection, while its role in axonal repair highlights new therapeutic targets.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Subwavelength focusing of hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) offers a powerful strategy for confining light beyond the diffraction limit, enabling extreme energy localization and enhanced light-matter interactions. However, the limited field enhancement, tunability, and scalability of implementations have motivated interest in polaritonic rays—high-momentum modes that offer collimated, diffraction-free propagation and an elevated optical density of states—as a promising alternative for efficient energy transport and deep subwavelength confinement. Yet, dynamic control and functional integration of such modes, particularly tunable in plane focusing, remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate polarization-switchable in-plane focusing of ghost hyperbolic phonon polariton (g-HP) rays in bulk calcite—a monolithic, lithography—compatible platform that intrinsically supports ray-like modes without requiring artificial layering or phase-change engineering. By tailoring the antenna geometry, excitation frequency, and incident polarization, we realize reconfigurable focusing with up to 25-fold electric field enhancement. These results position calcite-based g-HPs as a scalable, low-loss polaritonic platform, offering new opportunities for mid infrared spectroscopy, reconfigurable photonic circuitry, and high-resolution optical sensing.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a psychological condition marked by persistent, overwhelming concern and intensified anxiety reactions that surpass situational stimuli, profoundly impacting social, vocational, and daily activities. Emerging evidence indicates that altered levels of cytokines and other biomarkers may contribute to mental disorders; however, knowledge on GDNF, TIMP4, and tPA with GAD remains ambiguous, limited, and inconsistent. The objective of this study was to evaluate their association with the pathophysiology of GAD. Methods This case–control study enrolled 101 GAD patients from the National Institute of Mental Health Hospital in Dhaka and 101 healthy controls from several sites across Dhaka city. The participants were assessed by a qualified psychiatrist according to DSM-5 criteria. To determine the severity of GAD symptoms, the GAD-7 scale was employed. Serum levels of GDNF, TIMP4, and tPA were quantified by ELISA methods. Results We found elevated serum GDNF levels in patients compared to control subjects. This increment demonstrated a significantly positive correlation with the patients' GAD severity. The ROC analysis of serum GDNF levels revealed diagnostic efficacy, with a sensitivity of 79.2% and a specificity of 74.7%. Furthermore, patients with GAD showed reduced serum TIMP4 levels than controls. This reduction exhibited a significantly negative correlation with the severity of GAD in patients. The ROC analysis of serum TIMP4 levels indicated diagnostic performance, with sensitivity and specificity of 75.2% and 78.2%, respectively. Additionally, a significant negative correlation was observed between serum GDNF and TIMP4 levels. However, we noted no such changes in serum tPA levels in GAD. Conclusions The current study demonstrates the altered serum GDNF and TIMP4 levels may be associated with the pathophysiology of GAD. The findings emphasize the potential of GDNF and TIMP4 for risk evaluation and therapeutic response for GAD.",

    "Abstract": "PURPOSE To assess the ongoing citation of the 2009 Nature Genetics article by Ross et al linking TPMT to cisplatin-induced ototoxicity and to evaluate the extent to which its disputed findings persist in the literature. METHODS A total of 378 Google Scholar citations of the 2009 Nature Genetics publication from 2009 to 2025 were examined, of which 214 PubMed-indexed manuscripts were screened and categorized by citation nuance (positive, negative/mixed) and citation characteristics using the framework proposed by Suelzer et al in a 2019 JAMA Network Opens study. Citation context was independently assessed by two reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by consensus of all three authors. RESULTS Most articles cited the 2009 publication in a favorable or uncritical manner, even in publications after 2015 US Food and Drug Administration's cisplatin label revision acknowledging that the 2009 findings were flawed. A minority of citations acknowledged conflicting evidence or questioned the study's validity. CONCLUSION Although the 2009 publication's findings have been widely challenged, many subsequent authors continue to cite the study without acknowledging its limitations. This pattern highlights the need for stronger postpublication oversight, more transparent editorial practices by high-impact journals, and greater critical engagement by authors when citing foundational literature to ensure that clinical and research narratives are shaped by reliable and current evidence.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Great-grandparents are key figures in the transmission of family history and values. Despite their recognized importance, there is scant population-based research estimating the prevalence of great-grandparents in the contemporary United States. This research note uses the most recently available nationally representative survey data to characterize great-grandparenthood in the United States from 1996 until 2012, when the Health and Retirement Study ceased asking harmonizable great-grandparenthood questions. The prevalence of great-grandparenthood increases steadily with age, from 11% of 60‒64-year-olds, to just over half at ages 80‒84, to about two thirds of those 90 or older. There has been surprising little change over the cohorts prior to the baby boom, but cohorts born after 1942 have lower rates of great-grandparenthood in their 50s and early 60s. Great-grandparenthood is somewhat more prevalent among women than men and is strongly patterned by educational attainment, with distinct patterns and levels for those with and without a college degree. Finally, we estimate that the number of great-grandparents in the United States has increased from 15.3 million in 1996 to 20.4 million in 2012, highlighting a 33% increase. This increase is due to population aging, coming despite slight declines in the proportion of individuals over 50 with great-grandchildren.",

This article’s authors put forward a new approach to drug sentencing that instead focuses on a person’s function in a drug enterprise. They also propose anchoring base offense levels to pre-Guidelines sentencing data. To illustrate this model, the authors present a rewritten version of USSG § 2D1.1 incorporating their proposed framework. Focusing on function rather than drug type and quantity will ensure that sentences are calibrated based on culpability and better fulfill the core purposes of punishment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In drug cases, the Guidelines frequently produce sentencing ranges that are greater than necessary. This problem is most pronounced at the highest offense levels and is reflected in the high rates at which judges impose sentences below the guidelines range. The drug guideline’s quantity-based approach tied to mandatory minimums is not required and should be changed. This article’s authors propose the Sentencing Commission amend the drug guideline to (1) reduce most of the base offense levels in the Drug Quantity Table by 6, (2) expand and strengthen the list of specific offense characteristics, and (3) cap cumulative offense levels for nonviolent drug crimes. Together, these changes would reduce the focus on drug quantity and emphasize offense characteristics that better capture a person’s culpability. A “Drugs Minus Six” Amendment is consistent with the Commission’s previous amendments to the drug guideline and offers a more workable fix than alternative proposals that focus on downward adjustments. Mitigation-based downward adjustments have proved difficult to operationalize and will likely result in either underinclusive binaries or overcomplicated inquiries that deter widespread usage. A reduction to baseline sentences must be the core of any meaningful reform to the drug guideline.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Trigeminal schwannomas (TSs) are rare, mostly benign tumors that exhibit an indolent clinical course. The lateral orbitotomy approach (LOA), with or without endoscopic assistance, has emerged as a novel skull base route, particularly for accessing lesions confined to the middle cranial fossa. Herein, we elucidate the advantages and limitations of the LOA for the treatment of TSs. METHODS: All TS cases that underwent LOA through a lateral canthus incision during the past decade in our department were retrospectively reviewed. The operative technique was detailed, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Eight patients (4 females) with an average age of 37 years underwent LOA for TSs. The mean maximum tumor diameter was 2.7 cm (range: 1.8-3.7 cm). Seven were primary and one was recurrent, the latter in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 2. All tumors were predominantly in the middle cranial fossa, with 4 having either a small or medium posterior fossa component (6: Samii Type A; 2: Type C). Presenting symptoms included trigeminal neuralgia (n = 6), facial hypoesthesia (n = 6), headache (n = 5), and double vision (n = 3). All patients underwent gross (n = 6) or near-total (n = 2) resection. Neuralgia, while not exacerbated, reappeared in 4 patients after surgery and was ameliorated with medication. Two patients sustained new trigeminal hypoesthesia, and preoperative abducens palsy either improved or resolved in all 3 cases. No orbital complications, cerebrospinal fluid leak, or mortalities occurred. Two lesions had minor recurrence during a mean follow-up of 42.9 months. The first underwent radiosurgery 6 years postoperatively and the second is under close surveillance. CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive LOA stands as a plausible and aesthetically favorable surgical corridor for addressing TSs of the middle cranial fossa, even with extension into the posterior fossa. However, additional study is required as the approach may be limited for tumors with significant posterior or infratemporal fossa involvement.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A comprehensive, linear, and reliable radiographic scale for pituitary adenoma invasiveness that accounts for tumor invasion into multiple anatomic structures is needed to correlate with surgical outcomes and genetic and molecular signatures. In this study, we present the INVasiveness in pituitary ADEnomas (INVADE) score and evaluate its inter-rater and intra-rater reliability. We evaluated the INVADE score to predict the extent of resection (EOR) and functional status. METHODS: Six neurosurgeons or neuroradiology attending physician raters each individually scored 40 unique MRI and computed tomography scans of biopsy-proven pituitary adenomas. Inter-rater reliability was calculated for the total score and for each component of the score. After a 4-week washout period, 3 raters rescored each set of MRI and computed tomography scans and intra-rater reliability was evaluated. Inter-rater and intra-rater reliability values were determined using weighted Cohen's κ coefficients. Tumors were dichotomized into high (3-6) and low (0-2) INVADE scores, and the EOR and functional status were compared. RESULTS: Overall, the inter-rater reliability of the INVADE score was strong ( κ = 0.725; 95% CI, 0.612-0.824). Regarding the individual components of the score, the reliability for arachnoid, cavernous sinus, and sellar face/floor invasion was strong, whereas the reliability for brain parenchyma, clivus, and lateral sphenoid bone invasion was moderate. Intra-rater reliability was nearly perfect (κ = 0.836; 95% CI, 0.713-0.909). Tumors with high (3-5) INVADE scores had significantly lower volumetric EOR (79.1% vs 96.0%, P &lt; .001) and were more likely functional ( P = .020) and outperformed the Knosp score. CONCLUSION: We present a novel scale to assess global radiographic invasiveness in pituitary adenomas. The INVADE score demonstrated strong inter-rater reliability and nearly perfect intra-rater reliability. High INVADE scores correlated with significantly lower volumetric EOR. Our results suggest that the INVADE score may be useful for future clinical and research applications.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: External ventricular drain (EVD) placement is the most commonly performed bedside emergent neurosurgical procedure. However, catheter misplacement occurs in approximately 25% of cases, potentially resulting in neurological injury or the need for repositioning, highlighting the need for safer and more accurate placement techniques. This review aims to (1) summarize technological innovations developed to enhance the accuracy and safety of bedside EVD placement, (2) evaluate their reported benefits and limitations, and (3) identify key barriers to their clinical implementation in critical care settings. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of PubMed, Embase, and Scopus combining terms related to EVD placement and assistive technologies. All the studies evaluated EVD placement using simulations, phantoms, cadavers, and patient procedures conducted at the bedside and in the operating room. RESULTS: We identified 3898 records, and 76 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 30 studies compared stereotactic systems, ultrasound guidance, frameless neuronavigation, and augmented or mixed reality technologies to the freehand technique. These studies consistently reported improved accuracy with advanced systems although complication rates and procedural times were variably reported. An additional 35 and 12 studies evaluated nonimmersive and immersive technologies, respectively, in noncomparative settings. Most of these demonstrated high first-pass success and mean tip deviations under 3 mm. Variability in the definitions of accuracy and procedural metrics limited data synthesis, but the overall findings suggest a promising trajectory for technology-assisted EVD placement. CONCLUSION: Assistive technologies for EVD placement show potential to improve accuracy and safety over the freehand technique. These early successes signal potential to improve bedside neurosurgical care. Realizing this promise will require future studies to standardize accuracy metrics, report time, and safety outcomes consistently and validate performance in real-world critical care settings.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The atrium is one of the most complex regions to approach in the brain because of its deep location and the complexity of the surrounding white matter fiber anatomy. The ipsilateral posterior interhemispheric transprecuneus approach was first described, and subsequently, the contralateral posterior interhemispheric transprecuneus approach gained popularity. Each surgical route presents some disadvantages such as the difficulty of exposing the lateral portion of the lesion, the presence of bridging veins, brain retraction, and the risk of memory impairment. We present an alternative approach to lesions of the atrium using a natural pathway through the parieto-occipital fissure. The aim of this anatomic study is to evaluate the surgical feasibility of the contralateral transfalcine transparieto-occipital fissure approach (CTTFa) and the usefulness of the endoscope as the sole visualization source. METHODS: Four formalin-fixed cadaver heads were used for this study and investigated to perform 8 surgical CTTFa procedures. Surgical measurements were obtained, evaluating skin incision, craniotomy area, working area and distance from the craniotomy to the splenium, the parieto-occipital fissure, and the atrium. Moreover, 2 human cerebral hemispheres treated using the Klingler technique were used to investigate the relative white matter anatomy. RESULTS: The craniotomy area measurements averaged 8.2, 4.2, and 3.1 cm 2 for the ipsilateral posterior interhemispheric transprecuneus approach, CTTFa without endoscopy, and CTTFa with the use of an endoscope, respectively. In addition, the endoscopic CTTFa showed an optimal working angle and distance from craniotomy to parieto-occipital fissure, splenium, and atrium. CONCLUSION: The pure endoscopic CTTFa allows adequate visualization of the atrium while minimizing brain retraction, avoiding damage to white matter tracts, and reducing both the size of the craniotomy and the skin incision. This is achieved without exposing the superior sagittal sinus or damaging the precuneus area.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Surgery remains first-line therapy for most functioning pituitary adenomas (FPA). Remission rates are lower in some patients due to cavernous sinus invasion. Medial wall resection (MWR) may improve biochemical remission but remains largely underutilized. Our objective is to assess outcomes of MWR in patients with FPA at Oregon Health &amp; Science University performed by a single neurosurgeon. METHODS: Retrospective, Institutional Review Board–approved study: patients ≥18 years, FPA after MWR with ≥ 3-months follow-up. Remission: normal prolactin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and either adrenal insufficiency or normal cortisol at 3 months for prolactinoma, acromegaly and Cushing disease (CD), respectively. Arginine vasopressin deficiency (AVP-D) defined as needing desmopressin at the last follow-up. Logistic regression identified predictors of biochemical remission. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients, mean age 41.2 years and adenoma size 12.6 mm; CD (39.1%), prolactinoma (37.5%), acromegaly (23.4%). Knosp grade 0 (31.2%), 1 (32.81%), 3 (14%) and 4 (12.5%). Overall remission rate was 82.8%, CD (92%), prolactinoma (87.5%), and acromegaly (60%). Acromegaly (odd ratio 0.035, 95% CI [0.0034, 0.345], P = .004) compared with CD and tumor size (odd ratio 0.87 per mm increase, 95% CI 0.79-0.96, P = .007) were negative predictors of remission. The mean operative time showed significant increase in Crooke (357 ± 128 minutes) vs non-Crooke corticotroph (243 ± 39.7 minutes, P = .012, 95% CI [14.9, 213]), lactotroph (243.1 ± 65.1 minutes, P = .009, 95% CI [17.2, 210.5]), or somatotroph (232.5 ± 45.8 minutes, P = .031, 95% CI [5.9, 243.1]) tumors. Complications include new hypopituitarism (9.4%): adrenal insufficiency 12.8% (prolactinoma and acromegaly), hypothyroidism (1.5%), hypogonadism (1.5%); arginine vasopressin deficiency (20.3%), and transient syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (4.7%), 1 cerebrospinal fluid leak and carotid injury (1.5%) repaired with direct coagulation without neurological sequelae. CONCLUSION: MWR is safe and effective for the surgical management of FPA, particularly in CD and prolactinomas. Despite a steep learning curve, the high remission rates, and low complications support its use in well-selected patients by experienced multidisciplinary teams.",

    "Abstract": "<ns3:p>Background Chronic migraine is frequently refractory to available preventive therapies. Image-guided cryoneurolysis of the greater occipital nerve (CryoGON) may provide longer-lasting relief than conventional greater occipital nerve (GON) blocks. This Stage 1 Registered Report describes a prospective, exploratory study evaluating whether response to a conventional GON block predicts subsequent response to CryoGON, and assesses open-label safety, tolerability, feasibility and efficacy of CryoGON. Methods The study is planned as a single-site, investigator-initiated, open-label clinical investigation. Adults with chronic migraine will complete a ≥28-day electronic baseline diary before receiving bilateral conventional GON blocks, followed by a ≥28-day observation. Eligible participants then undergo navigation-guided CryoGON with 12-week follow-up. The primary endpoint is the association between change in moderate-to-severe headache days after GON block (weeks 1–4) and after CryoGON (weeks 9–12). Key secondary endpoints estimate the diagnostic performance of GON-block response applying a ≥30% reduction threshold for treatment effect to identify CryoGON responders, including sensitivity, specificity and predictive values. Additional endpoints include change in migraine days, patient-reported global impression of change, Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire v2.1, procedure tolerability, technical success, and safety (treatment-emergent adverse events and adverse device effects). Women of childbearing potential, including pregnant and breastfeeding participants, are eligible for participation. Discussion This study will provide the first systematic evaluation of whether a simple, widely available GON block can guide patient selection for CryoGON and will generate foundational open-label data on its clinical performance and safety. Findings will inform the design and justification of a subsequent sham-controlled trial. Trial registration and approvals The study will preregister at ClinicalTrials.gov. and obtain all necessary ethical approvals before study initiation.

    "Abstract": "When a data breach happens, both victims, whose data were breached, and nonvictims react negatively but not equally so. In this study, we used Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica data breach to identify to what extent reactions of data breach victims go beyond those of nonvictims. Our findings reveal that victims initially lose more trust, feel more violated, feel more strongly that a psychological contract has been breached, feel less belonging on Facebook, and intend to continue using Facebook less. However, these effects are short-lived, disappearing within six months. Intuitively, one might assume that this is because people are locked in on Facebook and are forced to change their attitudes because they cannot change their behavior by leaving it. Surprisingly, a follow-up experiment shows that this is not the case as we found people who are less locked in to improve their attitudes more over time. Our study adds to the mounting evidence that consumers are unable to act when their data are breached and their privacy is violated and that regulation may be needed to better protect data. The short-lived nature of victims’ reactions we identified in this case also raises questions about the role of postbreach compensation in different contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Problem definition: Motivated by major e-commerce platforms’ diverse practices in bestseller information provision, this paper examines consumers’ learning, searching, and purchasing behavior under uncertainty about products’ values, whereas a revenue-maximizing platform strategically decides whether and, if so, how to disclose products’ past sales information to consumers. Methodology/results: We analyze a two-period Bayesian learning model that embeds consumers’ sequential product search in a social learning framework and shows how the interaction between bestseller information and consumer search impacts sales and welfare. We find that a bestseller list constitutes an informative yet noisy signal about the products’ values. The informativeness of the signal is determined by the granularity of the bestseller information. By evaluating bestseller information of two levels of granularity, sales ranking and sales volume, we discover that, although consumers benefit more from information of a higher granularity (i.e., sales volume), the platform may prefer providing information of a lower granularity (i.e., sales ranking), suggesting that the platform may withhold information at the cost of consumers. In particular, an inference effect unique to multiproduct Bayesian learning gives rise to the possibility that disclosure of sales volume backfires and hurts the platform. We demonstrate significant sales implications of bestseller information granularity and show that concave distribution functions for consumers’ search cost, a stochastic increase in product values, or a growth in consumer population can tilt the platform’s preference toward displaying bestseller rankings without revealing sales volumes. Furthermore, we show that bestseller information may lead to lower purchased value or higher search cost, the latter implying that public learning may stimulate rather than substitute private learning. Managerial implications: The paper cautions retail platform practitioners about a pitfall associated with disclosing bestseller sales volume and presents guidelines on the timing and granularity of sales information provision. The findings also suggest e-commerce platforms with consumer-centric goals enhance bestseller information transparency on their marketplaces. Funding: W.

    "Abstract": "Organizations can gain substantial knowledge synergies from their alliance portfolios, and research suggests firms may benefit even more when their partners compete directly with each other. However, firms can only capture such synergies if their own inventors are allowed to freely exchange knowledge obtained from these partners to create novel combinations. We challenge this premise and argue that, because partners in such configurations are more concerned about the risks of knowledge leakage to their rivals, they will pressure the focal firm into imposing credible safeguards that restrict the access and handling of knowledge inside its organization. We predict that the constraints imposed by these safeguards will be reflected in a higher disconnectedness in the focal firm’s inventor collaboration network, with the extent of these constraints tied to the relative technological bargaining power the focal firm holds over its partners. Importantly, these safeguards are not costless, and we predict that the disconnectedness induced will affect the focal firm’s innovation performance by undermining its ability to create and appropriate inventive value. Using a longitudinal sample of pharmaceutical firms, we find consistent support for these arguments. Our study contributes to research on interfirm alliances, intraorganizational networks, and innovation while offering practical insights for managers.

    "Abstract": "Strategic foresight—that is, the ability to predict strategic outcomes—depends on how decision-makers represent strategic problems. Time constraints and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly salient factors shaping this process. We study how both jointly affect mental representations and strategic foresight in a startup evaluation task (N = 348). Using a 2 × 2 experimental design, we show that both time constraints and LLM use significantly alter the characteristics of mental representations. Despite these representational shifts, neither time constraints nor LLM use are found to significantly change strategic foresight. Additional analyses indicate, for instance, that LLM use increases information overload and reduces psychological ownership. Our findings can be viewed as a cautionary case for the effectiveness of LLM use in strategic decision-making. Thus, our findings suggest several avenues for future research on LLM use and strategic foresight, particularly regarding the interplay between individual cognitive processes and the contextual factors of strategic decisions.

Aim: The aims of this service evaluation were to explore the factors contributing to high turnover of nurses in elderly care and propose retention strategies. Design: A qualitative design was used. Methods: Seven semi-structured interviews were conducted with nurses from six wards within the elderly care division. Results: Three main themes emerged: staff and patient safety; lack of career progression; and training needs. Conclusion: Nurses in elderly care face both personal and organisational challenges. Prioritising their development, safety and recognition is crucial for retention. Trusts should acknowledge and support these nurses' hard work and commitment. Recommendations include flexible working patterns, providing adequate skill mix on the wards and opportunities for career progression in elderly care.",

    "Abstract": "Aims Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) represents one of the most severe complications following joint arthroplasty, often associated with a high recurrence rate despite appropriate therapeutic interventions. The underlying mechanisms contributing to this persistent risk remain incompletely understood. We hypothesize that alterations in joint capsule vascularization and fibrotic remodelling contribute to the pathophysiology of PJI and its recurrence. Methods A total of 69 patients undergoing joint arthroplasty surgery were included in the study (21 controls: primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA), 22 PJI revision: explantation, and 26 PJI revision: prosthesis reimplantation after temporary arthrodesis). Each knee joint capsule specimen was analyzed using haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, Masson’s trichrome, Sirius red staining, immunofluorescence staining, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Results Mean vessel area, diameter, and perimeter were reduced in PJI specimens, despite an overall increase in the number of blood vessels. A significant reduction in smooth muscle cell (SMC) and pericyte layer thickness, along with decreased pericyte coverage of vessel walls, was observed following both explantation and reimplantation. Fibrotic remodelling, indicated by increased collagen deposition, was markedly elevated in PJI samples at both stages. Gene expression analysis revealed upregulation of PDGFB, MIG, MMP-9, and COL1A1 at explantation or reimplantation, while PDGFA and FN1 were downregulated at explantation and significantly upregulated at reimplantation. VEGFA and FGF-2 expression remained consistently suppressed. Conclusion PJI is associated with profound vascular remodelling and fibrotic transformation of the joint capsule, marked by aberrant angiogenesis, disrupted vessel architecture, and distinct gene expression profiles. These alterations may impair tissue perfusion, compromise immune surveillance, and hinder antibiotic delivery, thereby contributing to recurrent infection. Targeting soft-tissue vascularization and fibrosis may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to reduce PJI recurrence and enhance surgical outcomes.

    "Abstract": "Aims While trochlear dysplasia is recognized as a key factor in patellar instability, its association with specific patellar fracture patterns remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between trochlear dysplasia and patellar fractures through morphological analysis. Methods In this prospective cohort study of 318 patients with acute patellar fractures (January to June 2021), preoperative CT scans were analyzed for trochlear dysplasia parameters: sulcus angle, trochlear depth, and lateral trochlear inclination. Fractures were classified using AO/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) criteria with emphasis on inferior pole involvement. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify morphological predictors of fracture type. Results Trochlear dysplasia was identified in 152 (47.80%) of patients, with a mean sulcus angle of 144.44° (SD 11.16°), trochlear depth of 4.43 mm (SD 1.33), and lateral trochlear inclination of 18.25° (SD 4.89°). Fractures classified as AO/OTA types A and C1.3 were more prevalent in patients with trochlear dysplasia. Logistic regression analysis showed that the sulcus angle significantly influenced the occurrence of the distal fractures (p &lt; 0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 1.15, 95% CI 1.111 to 1.187). Conclusion Trochlear dysplasia, particularly manifested by an increased sulcus angle, is significantly associated with distal patellar fractures. These findings highlight the importance of preoperative morphological assessment in predicting fracture patterns and tailoring clinical management.

    "Abstract": "Diabetes can cause serious complications such as liver damage and nerve pain. Unfortunately, existing treatment options for these problems often have limited effectiveness and unwanted side effects. To find better therapeutic alternatives with good efficacy and safety profile this study tested a novel quinazolinone derivative, (E)-1-benzoyl-3-((4(dimethylamino)benzylidene)amino)-2-(4-(dimethylamino)phenyl)-2,3 dihydroquinazoline-4(1H)-one , in diabetic mice’s experiencing liver damage and neuropathic pain. Diabetes was induced in mice using alloxan (150 mg/kg). For possible antidiabetic effect, test compound was given in doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg. The standard drugs used for comparison was Glibenclamide (5 mg/kg), Tramadol (50 mg/kg) and Diclofenac sodium (50 mg/kg) for pain relief, and Gabapentin (75 mg/kg) for nerve pain. Pain relieving effect was assessed using various test models (e.g., hot plate, writhing, allodynia, and hyperalgesia). Liver function was studied through blood tests and tissue examination. The test compound (at test dose of 20 mg/kg) led to a significant reduction in blood glucose even greater than the reduction seen with glibenclamide (5 mg/kg). Similarly, the test compound significantly reduced pain and showed protective effects on the liver. This new quinazolinone compound was found to be safe and effective in reducing diabetic nerve pain and liver damage in mice. It may offer a better alternative to currently available treatments like gabapentin and glibenclamide.",

    "Abstract": "The present study investigated associations between Big Five personality traits, their facets, and the frequency and variety of sexual fantasies in a sample of 5,225 adults ( M = 58.30 years old; 56.5% men). People high in conscientiousness and agreeableness report fewer sexual fantasies across exploratory, intimate, impersonal, and sadomasochistic domains; these effects were primarily driven by respectfulness and responsibility facets. Negative emotionality, particularly the depression facet, was associated with more frequent sexual fantasizing. Extraversion and open-mindedness showed minimal relationships with sexual fantasy frequency. These results underscore the importance of personality dimensions in understanding sexual thoughts, emphasizing the heterogeneity of sexual fantasies across individuals. Having a broader appreciation of the heterogeneity of sexual experiences can foster more inclusive approaches to sexual well-being in psychological research and clinical practice.",

    "Abstract": "Aquatic food webs typically include highly coupled fast, ‘green’ energy pathways driven by algae or phytoplankton and slower, ‘brown’ energy channels driven by detritus and terrestrial plants. Quantifying how much energy biological communities obtain from each of these pathways is essential, particularly across multiple interconnected food webs over large areas, because energy dynamics are known to influence ecosystem structure and function. Despite their importance, few studies track variance in energy channel contributions to food webs across interconnected habitats during distinct hydrologic seasons. In this study, we used tri-isotope Bayesian mixing models to quantify seasonal contributions of energy pathways to consumers in nine aquatic food webs across two river drainages in the Florida coastal Everglades. Sites span an ecosystem gradient from freshwater marshes to estuarine riverine mangroves and marine seagrass habitats. We found that green energy channels were the dominant pathway for consumers in 12 of 18 seasonal food webs, with the remaining 6 being more reliant on detrital energy channels. There were contrasting spatiotemporal trends between river networks. Shark River Slough food webs showed a clearer pattern of greener marsh food webs upstream switching to browner food webs more heavily reliant on mangrove detritus downstream. In contrast, Taylor Slough food webs showed the opposite pattern of browner marsh food webs upstream switching to greener food webs downriver and in marine seagrass habitats. Seasonal switching of the dominant energy channel was less common than expected, with 2 of 9 food webs shifting from green to brown dominance between the dry and wet season. Seasonal shifts disrupted spatial gradients in energy channel use, but the seasonal dynamics quantified in this single year study require further contextualization. Our findings provide a short but dynamic view of energy pathways in aquatic communities across the Everglades, but continued research will allow us to better predict how species, food webs, and ecological networks may respond to environmental drivers under future global change.",

    "Abstract": "Temperament influences canine behavior and helps determine a dog’s suitability as a companion or working animal. Although several temperament assessments exist, many rely on subjective evaluations, highlighting the need for scientifically validated methods. This study evaluated the validity of the Wesen temperament test by examining its association with physiological biomarkers—salivary cortisol and serotonin. Twenty-four dogs (11 females and 13 males) completed a modified Wesen test comprising seven subtests: Unconscious Confidence, Sociality, Noise Stability, Movement Stability, Desire for Play and Predation, Behavior in Stressful Situations, and Separation. Saliva samples were collected pre- and post-assessment, and cortisol and serotonin concentrations were measured using ELISA. Hormonal concentrations and temperament scores were analyzed using correlation, regression, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Pre-assessment cortisol concentrations were negatively correlated with total average temperament score and several subtest scores. Post-assessment cortisol concentrations showed significant negative correlations with total average scores and all subtests. Changes in cortisol concentrations from pre- to post-assessment were negatively associated with temperament scores. Dogs with higher temperament scores exhibited significantly higher serotonin concentrations than those with lower scores. These results support the utility of temperament assessments validated through physiological markers and provide novel evidence linking canine temperament with endocrine function.",

    "Abstract": "As intelligent manufacturing advances, computer vision-based defect detection systems have become essential components of industrial automation. However, this progress has also revealed new security vulnerabilities. In this work, we identify and examine a stealthy adversarial vector—the Alpha Channel Attack—which exploits the often-ignored transparency layer in RGBA images to inject imperceptible perturbations, thereby evading both human perception and conventional preprocessing defenses.We evaluate this threat across diverse model architectures, including YOLOv5, FastGAN, and state-of-the-art vision-language models such as DeepSeek-VL2, ChatGPT-4o, and KIMI. Experimental results show that alpha-channel perturbations cause substantial degradation in detection, generation, and multimodal alignment metrics—including mAP, FID, BLEU, METEOR, and CLIP Score—while leaving the visible image content unchanged.To mitigate this invisible yet high-impact risk, we propose a lightweight detection mechanism that integrates histogram overlap and MSE analysis within the alpha channel. The framework achieves an AUC of 0.998, demonstrating strong capability in identifying adversarial samples under real-world constraints.Overall, this study reveals a critical blind spot in modern visual data pipelines and introduces both a novel threat model and an effective defense strategy, contributing to the development of more resilient industrial AI systems.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives This study aims to evaluate the analytical and clinical performance of the Abbott Alinity TRAb chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay and establish the reference interval for healthy Chinese populations. Methods The precision, analytical sensitivity and linearity of Abbott TRAb assay were verified in accordance with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. A total of 300 samples from patients with Grave’s disease (GD) and other thyroid diseases were collected for method comparison and clinical performance verification. The performance of Abbott and Snibe TRAb assays was compared to Roche TRAb assay by correlation and agreement analysis. The diagnostic performance of Abbott TRAb assay was analyzed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The reference interval of Abbott TRAb was established from a cohort of 366 healthy individuals. Results The Abbott Alinity TRAb assay demonstrated excellent precision, with repeatability (CV%) ranging from 1.04% to 5.92%, and within-laboratory imprecision (CV%) ranging from 1.09% to 5.92%. Manufacturer-claimed limits of blank, detection, and quantification were successfully verified. Linearity was confirmed from 1.14 to 47.72 IU/L. Strong correlation was observed between Abbott and Roche assays (Spearman r = 0.972; slope = 1.060), while Snibe and Roche assays showed lower correlation (r = 0.784). Concordance analysis showed the total agreement with Roche results were 97.7% for Abbott and 96.7% for Snibe. Diagnostic accuracy of the Abbott TRAb assay for GD was high, yielding an area under curve (AUC) of 0.999, sensitivity of 98.4%, and specificity of 99.4% at an optimal cutoff of 2.89 IU/L. The upper reference limits at 95 th percentile and 97.5 th percentile for healthy Chinese population using Abbott TRAb assay were 1.56 IU/L and 1.95 IU/L, respectively. Conclusions This study demonstrated the robustness of Abbott Alinity TRAb CMIA in clinical use with its verified analytical and clinical performance and established the reference interval for Chinese population.",

    "Abstract": "Endothelial cells play a critical role in the inflammatory response during sepsis, however, their metabolic adaptations to inflammatory stimuli remain much less characterized compared to immune cells. Here, we demonstrate that Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs) do not undergo the metabolic and respiratory rewiring typically observed in macrophages following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, a common model of inflammation during sepsis. A key metabolite in LPS-activated macrophages is itaconate, which is known for its anti-inflammatory properties. Although HUVECs do not naturally produce itaconate, we explored whether exogenous administration of the cell-permeable derivative 4-octyl itaconate (4-OI) could modulate their response to LPS. Remarkably, 4-OI treatment significantly reduced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) levels in LPS-treated HUVECs, restoring them to baseline levels. This antioxidant effect was accompanied by a pronounced decrease in inflammasome activation, including suppression of ASC speck formation and caspase-1 activation. These findings suggest that 4-OI could protect endothelial cells from inflammation during sepsis in a manner similar to its role in macrophages. Mechanistically, 4-OI acts through the KEAP1/NRF2 antioxidant pathway. Silencing of KEAP1, the direct molecular target of 4-OI, resulted in a pronounced upregulation of NRF2 target genes, particularly HMOX1, with modest effects on NQO1 and no change in GCLC. NRF2 knockdown decreased HMOX1 expression and blunted 4-OI’s effects, although some residual induction persisted. Further confirming the importance of this pathway, KEAP1 silencing itself suppressed LPS-induced mitoROS, ASC speck formation, and caspase-1 activation, mimicking 4-OI treatment. Taken together, these results demonstrate that 4-OI protects endothelial cells from LPS-induced oxidative stress and inflammation primarily via the KEAP1/NRF2 axis.",

    "Abstract": "Compositional generalization—the systematic combination of known components into novel structures—is fundamental to flexible human cognition, yet the mechanisms that enable it in neural networks remain poorly understood in both machine learning and cognitive science. [1] showed that a compact encoder-decoder transformer can achieve simple forms of compositional generalization in a sequence arithmetic task. In this work, we identify and mechanistically interpret the circuit responsible for this behavior in such a model. Using causal ablations, we isolate the circuit and show that this understanding enables precise activation edits to steer the model’s outputs predictably. We find that the circuit performs function composition without encoding the specific semantics of any given function—instead, it leverages a disentangled representation of token position and identity to apply a general token remapping rule across an entire family of functions. Although the circuit mechanism was identified in a limited number of small scale models with a synthetic task, it sheds light to how symbolic compositionality can emerge in transformers and offer testable hypotheses for similar mechanisms in large-scale models. Code for model and analysis is publicly available .",

    "Abstract": "Background Dermatomyositis (DM) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) share immuno-inflammatory features, yet mechanisms underlying their comorbidity remain unclear. We aimed to define shared molecular mechanisms across gene regulatory networks and the immune microenvironment using integrated multi-omics and machine-learning analyses. Methods Microarray datasets for RA (GSE55235, GSE55457, GSE12021) and DM were retrieved from GEO. RA datasets were merged and batch-corrected with ComBat. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using limma; key modules were derived by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Intersected DEGs–module genes underwent GO/KEGG enrichment. Core genes were prioritised by LASSO regression and random-forest modelling and evaluated in external cohorts. Immune landscape was estimated with CIBERSORT and immune subpopulations profiled by single-sample GSEA. Single-cell RNA-seq (GSE159117) mapped cell-type–specific expression of core genes and inferred ligand–receptor networks. Results We identified 780 DEGs in RA and 739 in DM. Intersecting DEGs with WGCNA modules yielded 47 candidates enriched for IL-17, Toll-like receptor and chemokine signalling (all P &lt; 0.05). Four core genes (JUNB, NRGN, HCP5, RARRES3) were prioritised; HCP5 and RARRES3 showed significant differential expression and diagnostic performance in external datasets (AUC 0.634–0.846). CIBERSORT indicated enrichment of activated CD4 + memory T cells and a shift in macrophage polarisation with increased M2 signatures in both diseases. Core genes were dynamically associated with M1/M2 polarisation and T-cell subpopulations ( P &lt; 0.05). Single-cell analysis localised core gene expression to NK cells, monocytes and T/B cells, and highlighted inflammatory ligand–receptor interactions. Conclusions Integrative, ML-assisted transcriptomics reveals convergent RA–DM programmes centred on IL-17, TLR and chemokine pathways with remodelling of the immune microenvironment. HCP5 and RARRES3 emerge as reproducible, externally supported candidates with diagnostic potential and plausible links to macrophage polarisation and T-cell states. These findings nominate testable biomarkers and pathways for validation and provide a rationale for pathway-guided, cross-disease studies of RA–DM comorbidity.",

    "Abstract": "Autophagy is a highly conserved, intracellular recycling process by which cytoplasmic contents are degraded in the lysosome. This process occurs at a low level constitutively; however, it is induced robustly in response to stressors, in particular, starvation of critical nutrients such as amino acids and glucose. That said, the relative contribution of these inputs is ambiguous, and many starvation medias are poorly defined or devoid of multiple nutrients. Here, we set out to create a quantitative dataset of autophagy across multiple stages in single, living cells, measured under normal growth conditions and during nutrient starvation of amino acids or glucose. We found that autophagy is induced by starvation of amino acids, but not glucose, in U2OS cells, and that MTORC1-mediated ULK1 regulation and autophagy are tightly linked to amino acid levels. While autophagy is engaged immediately during amino acid starvation, a heightened response occurs during a period marked by transcriptional upregulation of autophagy genes during sustained starvation. Finally, we demonstrated that cells immediately return to their initial, low-autophagy state when nutrients are restored, highlighting the dynamic relationship between autophagy and environmental conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Background: It is unclear whether hyperhydration induced via glycerol, sodium bicarbonate or a combination of the two is most effective. Aim: This study evaluated the effects of glycerol-, sodium bicarbonate-, and glycerol + sodium bicarbonate-induced hyperhydration on measures of fluid retention, blood buffering capacity, and gastrointestinal symptoms at rest, in comparison to a fluid-only control. Methods Eleven healthy participants (six male) completed four trials (randomised, crossover design). Treatments consisted of glycerol-(G) = 1.0 g·kg -1 body mass glycerol; sodium bicarbonate-(SB) = 0.3 g·kg -1 body mass sodium bicarbonate; and combined glycerol and sodium bicarbonate supplementation-(G + SB) = 1.0 g·kg -1 body mass glycerol + 0.3 g·kg -1 body mass sodium bicarbonate; and a fluid only control-(CON) = 25 mL·kg -1 body mass artificially sweetened water. At baseline and at 20 min intervals for 180 min, urine samples were collected and analysed for volume, colour, and specific gravity, and gastrointestinal symptoms and body mass were quantified. At 60 min intervals, capillary blood was analysed for pH, blood bicarbonate concentration and plasma volume change. Results Compared to CON, fluid retention was significantly higher with G + SB from 120–180 min, SB from 120–140 min, and G from 160–180 min (p &lt; 0.05), and accumulated urine volume was significantly lower with G + SB from 100–180 min, SB from 120–180 min, and G from 140–180 min (p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in fluid retention between G + SB, SB or G at any time point (p &gt; 0.05). Compared to G and CON, blood pH and blood bicarbonate concentration was significantly higher with G + SB and SB from 60–180 min (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusions Fluid retention improved in G, SB and G + SB compared to CON, although there were no additive effects with G + SB compared to SB or G. Buffering capacity was significantly higher with SB and G + SB compared to G and CON. Minimal GI symptoms were induced by G, SB, G + SB and CON.",

    "Abstract": "Background The emigration of skilled healthcare workers (HCWs) seeking better opportunities poses major challenges to healthcare systems in low- and middle-income countries. Amidst ongoing economic and political crises, Lebanon is facing substantial healthcare workforce migration. This study explored the migration intentions of Lebanese HCWs, identifies key drivers, and proposes context-specific retention strategies. Methods A mixed-methods design was employed at Rafik Hariri University Hospital (RHUH) in Beirut, Lebanon. A structured survey assessed migration intentions and associated drivers among frontline healthcare workers, while semi-structured interviews with department chiefs explored organizational and systemic factors influencing workforce retention. Quantitative data were analyzed to identify predictors of migration intentions, and qualitative data were thematically analyzed using a combined deductive–inductive approach. Results Among 120 HCWs surveyed, 70% expressing intentions to migrate—primarily due to financial concerns (93%) and security issues (81%). Lower satisfaction with pay (adjusted OR= 0.85, 95% CI = 0.72–0.996) was significantly associated with migration intentions. Qualitative findings confirmed widespread staff migration since 2019, leading to critical shortages, heavier workloads, and department closures. Department chiefs emphasized the need for financial incentives, professional development opportunities, supportive management, and flexible scheduling to improve retention. Conclusions HCW migration from Lebanon reflects a complex interplay of financial, professional, and systemic factors. Immediate and sustainable policy interventions—combining financial stabilization with workforce development and improved working conditions—are urgently required to preserve healthcare system functionality and resilience.",

    "Abstract": "Background Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic condition classified by widespread pain, fatigue, and associated symptoms. Patients with FM are frequently referred to physical therapists, whose knowledge of assessment criteria and management strategies is critical for timely recognition and effective care. Early diagnosis has been shown to improve outcomes, whereas delayed recognition often leads to prolonged suffering and increased healthcare costs. Aim The objective of this study was to examine the knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes of physical therapists in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with respect to the diagnosis and management of FM. Methods A cross-sectional self-reported survey was distributed electronically to practicing physical therapists across the UAE. The survey collected demographic data, as well as information on confidence in determining and managing FM, awareness of international guidelines, perceptions of other healthcare providers roles, and knowledge of the risk factors. Results A total of 300 physical therapists were invited, and 240 completed the survey and met the inclusion criteria (response rate of 80%). The results revealed a predominantly female workforce, with 73.8% of participants identifying as female. The age of most respondents ranged between 23 and 42 years. Almost half of the participants had less than five years of experience. Nearly two-thirds of participants expressed confidence in diagnosing and managing FM cases. Most participants were unaware of any of the international FM practice guidelines (1990 ACR, 2010 ACR, 2012 Canadian). Conclusion The findings of this study underscore a concern for a lack of confidence and awareness among physical therapists in the UAE regarding the diagnosis and management of FM cases. Despite a significant proportion of participants reporting experience in managing FM cases, the majority were not familiar with recent FM practice guidelines, indicating potential gaps in knowledge and practice. This study highlights the importance of improving curricular integration of FM content, and greater dissemination of evidence-based guidelines. Addressing these gaps will be essential for promoting earlier diagnosis, reducing delays in management, and improving patient outcomes in the UAE.",

    "Abstract": "Under the dual pressures of global warming and rapid urbanization, the mechanisms governing the evolution of high-temperature environments in arid-zone cities demand systematic analysis. This study investigates the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and multidimensional influencing factors of urban expansion and thermal environments in the Kashgar region. As a representative city in China’s arid western region, the analysis utilizes multi-source remote sensing data and socioeconomic statistics from 2010 to 2024. Methods including urban expansion indices, surface temperature inversion, and geographic detector models were employed to reveal spatiotemporal patterns linking urban form changes and thermal environments. The findings indicate: (1) Kashgar’s urban expansion exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity, with construction land expansion characterized by stable central areas and rapid peripheral growth. Marginal expansion dominates the thermal environment, where the township-Mulatibag urban-rural fringe has emerged as a new growth pole for thermal expansion. (2) Kashgar’s thermal environment continues to deteriorate, with the area affected by high temperatures increasing by an average of 19.55% annually. The spatial pattern has undergone a three-stage evolution: punctual breakthroughs, cluster aggregation, and contiguous spread. The low-temperature ecological corridor system has systematically shrunk, and the city’s thermal environment regulation capacity shows a significant downward trend. (3) A strong positive correlation exists between Kashgar’s urban expansion and its thermal environment. This correlation exhibited a trend of “initial strengthening followed by weakening” over the fifteen-year period. (4) Factors influencing high temperatures exhibit multidimensional interactions. Among anthropogenic factors, impervious surfaces and population density jointly intensify high-temperature severity through a dual-factor amplification effect. Conversely, natural factors such as vegetation and water bodies exert a negative mitigating influence.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines how rainfall and groundwater recharge can help mitigate drought conditions, using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) as the drought indicator. It focuses on the top ten countries experiencing groundwater overexploitation and incorporates a global average perspective to provide deeper insights into these critical relationships. These insights are essential for informed policy-making and integrated decision-making, involving a range of stakeholders from local users to international policymakers on drought mitigation efforts from 1961 to 2022. The analysis employs the novel technique to estimate Dynamic Panel Threshold Regression (DPThR) model. The findings reveal that a 1-millimeter increase in rainfall improves the SPEI by 0.003 units, thereby reducing drought likelihood. The threshold for mitigating drought effects is identified at 614.41 millimeters of annual rainfall, with Pakistan, Iran, and Saudi Arabia being the most at-risk countries when rainfall falls below this level. Conversely, a one-standard-deviation increase in groundwater recharge enhances the SPEI by 5.06 units, indicating a substantial reduction in drought incidence. The threshold for mitigating drought effects is identified at –0.0039 standard deviations, with China, Iran, Mexico, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United States being the most drought-prone when recharge falls below this level. Furthermore, it was found that temperature exerts a consistently negative and highly significant effect, indicating that warming intensifies drought through evapotranspiration and soil moisture depletion. While CO 2 emissions show no significant direct impact. Moreover, the study identifies unidirectional causality running from rainfall, groundwater recharge, temperature, and CO 2 emissions, reinforcing the dominance of hydro-climatic forces in driving drought variability. Policy recommendations include advancing artificial rainfall, enhancing groundwater recharge, and maintaining country-specific water use thresholds to reduce drought risk and strengthen water and climate resilience in overexploited regions.",

    "Abstract": "The systems regulating blood pressure and calcium-magnesium (Ca 2+ -Mg 2+ ) homeostasis are increasingly recognized to have clinically relevant interactions, where alterations in one can lead to significant changes in the other. In this study, we developed a computational model integrating blood pressure regulation and Ca 2+ -Mg 2+ homeostasis in a male rat. We simulated various conditions, including hypertension, Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , and vitamin D 3 deficiencies, and primary hyperparathyroidism. Simulations of hypertension, induced by various stimuli like increased renin or aldosterone secretion, demonstrated significant effects on parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitriol, renal Ca 2+ /Mg 2+ handling, and bone resorption. Dietary Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , and vitamin D 3 deficiencies was predicted to elevate mean arterial pressure, with Mg 2+ deficiency having a stronger effect. Furthermore, the model predicted that primary hyperparathyroidism elevates PTH, Ca 2+ , and calcitriol, leading to increased mean arterial pressure and bone loss. Overall, this model provides valuable insights into the mechanistic links between blood pressure regulation and Ca 2+ -Mg 2+ homeostasis, offering insights into clinical conditions like hypertension and hyperparathyroidism.",

    "Abstract": "Background The triglyceride-cholesterol-body weight index (TCBI) is a simple and reliable indicator of nutritional status. This investigation aimed to explore the association between TCBI and sarcopenia among older individuals in China. Methods The AWGS 2019 criteria were utilized to evaluate sarcopenia. TCBI was calculated as (TG × TC × BW)/1000. Logistic regression analysis explored the independent connection between TCBI and the occurrence of sarcopenia. RCS was employed to investigate both linear and nonlinear correlations, and threshold effects were scrutinized. Furthermore, subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Results This study included 5293 participants. The TCBI was found to be negatively associated with sarcopenia in a fully corrected model, with a 66% decrease in the prevalence of sarcopenia for each 1-unit increase in LgTCBI (OR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.28–0.41; p &lt; 0.001). The study showed that this association was further highlighted in those with normal BMI and remains consistent in sensitivity analyses. Furthermore, we found a nonlinear association between both TCBI and sarcopenia, with an inflection point of 7.05 by the RCS curve and threshold effect analysis. Conclusion This study revealed a nonlinear negative correlation between TCBI and sarcopenia, highlighting the implications of these findings for the early screening and timely intervention of sarcopenia.",

    "Abstract": "Despite the availability of free basic vaccination programmes, the disparity continues in immunization coverage among children aged 12–23 months in India, particularly with increasing birth orders. Using the data from the NFHS 5 (2019–21), the study seeks to investigate how birth order affects the likelihood of children’s immunization aged 12–23 months in India. The analysis included a nationally representative sample of 43,436 children aged 12–23 months. Bivariate LISA and multilevel logistic regression models were performed to assess spatial and statistical patterns. The study found that spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated a positive association between 1st and 2nd birth orders and child full immunization coverage. However, the likelihood of full immunization declines significantly with increasing birth order [2 nd (OR: 0.91); 3 rd (OR: 0.74); 4 th (OR: 0.64); 5 th (OR: 0.56); 6 and more (OR: 0.41)]. Similarly, other socio-demographic covariates such as female children [AOR: 0.95], children who belong to Muslim families [AOR: 0.72], and resided in the northeastern part [AOR: 0.52] of India had a lower likelihood of being completely immunized. Therefore, the present study underscores the urgent need for targeted public health interventions that address both familial and structural barriers to immunization, specifically for mothers who have more than two children, to ensure that no child is left behind, regardless of their birth position within the family.",

    "Abstract": "Dysregulations in interoception have been associated with mental health disorders including eating and somatic symptom disorders. The present study addresses the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, behavioural intervention (InMe) in a healthy sample with low, self-reported interoception. The efficacy of the InMe intervention against an active control arm was tested in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) reported elsewhere, while the feasibility and acceptability of InMe were assessed in parallel and are fully reported here. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention arm (InMe) or active control arm and stratified according to their self-reported gender and a cut-off score from the Eating Disorders Questionnaire (EDE-Q). Feasibility and accessibility measures included self-report scales and questionnaires, assessor checklists and ratings, as well as behavioural and physiological responses. Data was gathered from a total of 102 participants and encompassed trial recruitment and retention rates, the suitability of measurement tools, as well as the feasibility and acceptability of stressors, interventions and other trial procedures. The study found satisfactory feasibility in recruitment procedures, trial measurement tools, and intervention procedures. Participants perceived the intervention as acceptable, though minor adjustments for trial optimisation were identified. Overall, this feasibility study provided promising evidence regarding the acceptability and feasibility of an interoception based intervention in a RCT context. These findings offer valuable insights particularly for the design of future clinical trials for testing the efficacy of this intervention further in clinical populations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The open access transition aims to replace traditional subscription models with Open Access (OA) models. Transformative agreements between academic institutions, consortia, and publishers play a central role in this process. This paper examines the provisions related to open metadata and data analytical research services in 13 publicly accessible transformative agreements involving German institutions and their consortia. The analysis reveals that the content of these agreements is heterogeneous, despite standardization initiatives such as the ESAC Initiative. While some agreements provide for open licensing of metadata (e.g., CC0), others dominate with restrictive clauses that limit the commercial use of metadata. Similarly, the regulations on metadata delivery to Crossref and repositories, as well as the integration of funding information, vary significantly. In the area of data analytical research services, the regulations on text and data mining (TDM) and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) are often restrictive, potentially hindering innovation and the development of new research methods. The lack of transparency of contract documents and the insufficient implementation of existing recommendations on open metadata and data analytical services are identified as key criticisms.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Mandarin differs essentially in colexification from many other languages due to its preference for controlled visual activity verb kan “look” over uncontrolled visual experience verb jian “see.” This triggers inquiries as to whether Mandarin is historically inclined to controlled visual activity. Based on a dynamic behavioral profile analysis, this study traces the semantic change in kan and jian from Archaic Chinese to Contemporary Chinese, with a particular focus on the evidential discourse markers derived from them. Through descriptive statistics and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), the data reveal that: (1) kan and jian have distinct behavioral profiles, and they primarily convey controlled visual activity and uncontrolled visual experience respectively in history; (2) kan has undergone semantic expansions with more varied usages, while jian has been decreasingly used; and (3) except in the Archaic period, the evidential discourse markers derived from kan exhibit greater semantic and structural diversities compared with those derived from jian . The comparison and contrast between the two basic vision verbs help to reveal Mandarin’s commonalities in semantic change while highlighting its peculiarity in emphasizing controlled visual activity over time.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Pijpops and Van de Velde (2016. Constructional contamination: How does it work and how do we measure it? Folia Linguistica 50(2). 543–581) demonstrated that an alternation within a construction may be influenced by a different construction that is coincidentally formally similar through the process of constructional contamination. This mechanism has been explained as a consequence of the storage of unanalyzed chunks produced by a contaminating construction, which are later recycled in a target construction. Consequently, constructional contamination has hitherto been measured by calculating the frequency of individual lexemes (which are assumed to be part of exemplar chunks eligible for recycling) in the contaminating construction. In this paper, we propose a different measurement for constructional contamination. Using the large language model RobBERT, we define “prototype embeddings” for both the target construction and the contaminating construction involved in constructional contamination. For each instance of the target construction, we calculate its similarity to these prototypes. We then show that these similarity variables are significantly correlated with the alternation within the target construction: the more an instance of the target construction is semantically similar to the contaminating construction, the more likely it is to appear with the alternant that is exclusively used in that contaminating construction. Our results are in line with a scenario in which horizontal links, which hold between formally similar constructions, can directly trigger constructional contamination. In addition, we find that the more semantically similar an instance is to the prototype of the target construction itself, the more likely it is to appear with the alternant that is not found in the contaminating construction, supporting a view of the constructional network in which constructions are themselves conceptualized as links rather than nodes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract A practical method for comparing the intrinsic electromagnetic attenuations of bulky materials has been introduced. This approach employs normal incidence reflection (S_11) only measurements of metal-backed walls constituted by building materials and relies on accurate processing of echoes from metal plates through a time gating algorithm. The resulting attenuation parameter α_diff reflects the difference in attenuation constants of two distinct materials per unit length. The technique has been validated using point scattering simulation and applied to 1–3 GHz real experimental data collected from two primary building materials: bims (or pumice) concrete and clay brick. The frequency variation of this relative measure has been evaluated, given the importance of understanding how these materials affect rubble-penetrating radar and other relevant applications.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Ophthalmology remains underrepresented in many medical curricula, contributing to limited understanding and confidence in the evaluation and management of ocular and visual conditions. Virtual patient cases, which constitute interactive, computer-based simulations that enable learners to engage with realistic patient scenarios in a controlled environment, offer an innovative strategy to strengthen ophthalmic education. This review compiled and analyzed evidence from articles assessing the educational impact of such tools in ophthalmology. Results from current studies suggest that virtual patient platforms can enhance medical knowledge, clinical reasoning, practical skills, and empathy while also encouraging further reading and fostering peer discussion. In addition, such programs are warmly received by learners, who report high satisfaction and appreciate their realistic, interactive, and enjoyable nature, flexibility in time and place, and constructive feedback. Despite substantial heterogeneity across studies, existing findings support virtual patient cases as effective, scalable, and engaging tools that hold promise to complement traditional instruction in ophthalmology and counteract the discipline’s marginalization in medical curricula. Nonetheless, further research is warranted to identify the most effective strategies for their integration into ophthalmology training programs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This article traces the evolution of Dariush Shayegan’s (1935–2018) conception of nihilism across three distinct phases of his thought. It argues that Shayegan’s work offers a crucial, non-Western perspective on nihilism, framing it not merely as a philosophical problem but as a central facet of Iran’s experience with modernity. In his early phase, influenced by Ahmad Fardid, he identified nihilism ( Nistengāri ) as a spiritual malady endemic to the West, which he contrasted with the perceived spiritual integrity of Eastern traditions. The 1979 Revolution precipitated a second phase, wherein Shayegan, deeply influenced by his mentor Henry Corbin, diagnosed nihilism as an internalized “disease” manifesting as the “ideologization of tradition” and a collective “schizophrenia.” His final phase, marked by a reading of Heidegger and Vattimo, moved from attempts to transcend nihilism towards its Verwindung (incorporation or recovery), finding in the poetry of Omar Khayyām a model for embracing a “pregnant nothingness” and affirming the present moment. Through this trajectory, Shayegan’s thought demonstrates how the Iranian intellectual tradition actively engaged with and transformed the concept of nihilism, contributing a unique intercultural response to a global philosophical concern.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The conventional sliding mode observer (SMO)-based sensorless control method for permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) usually requires a sigmoid function, and a low-pass filter (LPF) to reduce the sliding mode noise. However, the influences of the sigmoid function on the rotor position estimation are not clear, and the conventional rotor position compensation method has large errors. To solve these drawbacks, a position error reduced sensorless control method for PMSM based on an improved SMO and phase-locked loop (PLL) is proposed in this paper. First, the influences of the sigmoid function on the rotor position estimation are analyzed in detail. Then, to remove these influences, an improved SMO is proposed by introducing a cross-compensation term in the observer. Next, the drawbacks of the conventional rotor position compensation method are explained, and an improved PLL is further proposed, which not only can compensate the rotor position error generated by the LPF without using the estimated speed, but also can reduce the sliding mode chattering better. As a result, better sensorless control performance is achieved. Finally, experimental studies are carried out, which show that the rotor position estimation error is reduced from 0.2 rad to 0.0025 rad at 200 r/min, and it is reduced from 0.022 rad to 0.0025 rad at 1,000 r/min, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Assessing the quality of random bitstreams used to support cryptographic and other applications is crucially important as any detectable deviations from true randomness can introduce exploitable vulnerabilities resulting in a loss of security. Existing randomness tests, such as those recommended by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), examine statistical characteristics of bitstreams such as bit distributions, periodicity, cumulative sums and other properties. However, these methods do not explicitly test for generalized causality within a bitstream – instances where earlier sequences influence the likelihood of later sequences that are undetectable through correlation-based analyses. To address this gap, we propose a new approach, the Granger-inspired Test for Randomness (GTR), that applies principles of Granger causality to detect causal relationships within a single bitstream. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments using a 10-million-bit sample acquired from the NIST Randomness Beacon as a baseline case. We compare GTR to other methods that assess random bitstream quality. Our findings suggest that GTR outperforms many randomness tests, identifying subtle structural dependencies in bitstreams that are not detected with many current tests.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper concerns a global reconstruction method for fluorescence diffuse optical tomography (FDOT), reconstructing locations of multiple point targets from the measured temporal response functions. The targets are multiple fluorescent point objects with a nonzero fluorescence lifetime at unknown locations. Peak time, when the temporal response function of the fluorescence reaches its maximum, is a robust parameter of the temporal response function in FDOT. We derive an approximate peak time equation based on asymptotic analysis in an explicit way for the nonzero fluorescence lifetime when either single or multiple point targets exist. Then we develop a global bisection method to reconstruct the location of a single point target globally. Moreover, we adopt the global bisection method for the reconstruction of the locations of multiple point targets. Finally, several numerical experiments are implemented to show the efficiency and robustness of the addressed algorithms.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Prior studies have extensively examined narrative empathy and negative empathy, which primarily concern the readers’ affective engagement with fictional characters. This study shifts the focus to discourse from reader response by conceptualising de-empathy as a strategic stance that resists full emotional alignment while maintaining social intelligibility within television literature. Drawing on the excerpts from six works of contemporary Chinese emotional television literature, this study examines how the internal factors drive de-empathy into external linguistic manifestations. Accordingly, three strategies of de-empathy (affective, behavioural, and cognitive) have been identified through the lens of linguistic analysis, which illuminate how emotion ( ganqing ), relational expectations ( renqing ), and moral evaluation ( deqing ) are discursively negotiated. By pinpointing the discursive patterns and the underlying affective and moral norms, the study offers insight into the modulation of emotional distance in television literature narratives. Moreover, the findings above also invite reflection on the applicability of the de-empathy framework to broader literary and media contexts, highlighting its potential for cross-cultural analysis of affect and interpersonal negotiation.",

In the design of a survivable network, resources are allocated to both primary and backup routes to ensure reliable connection establishment. In heterogeneous networks, both Routing and Wavelength Assignment (RWA) and Routing and Spectrum Assignment (RSA) are employed to establish connections traversing through fixed and flexible optical nodes. This work presents a mathematical model, associated constraints, and simulation results for connection recovery using Dedicated Path Protection (DPP) and Partial Path Protection (PPP). For PPP, three scenarios of backup spectrum recovery 75 %, 50 %, and 25 % are evaluated. The performance is assessed using metrics such as bandwidth blocking probability, network resource utilization, and Resource Overbuild Ratio (ROR). Simulation results indicate that the bandwidth blocking probability across different survivability strategies ranges from 5.65 % to 13.92 %, while network capacity utilization varies from 56.15 % to 69.39 % of the total network capacity.",

It reveals how a belief, verbalized at the beginning of a text by linguistic units evoking particular cognitive structures, transforms it into an effect, i.e., an intended impact on the addressee. The suggested procedure mainly rests on the interaction of morphosyntactic constructions with image schemas, conceptual metaphor, and worldview which evoke different feelings, emotions, or basic needs. The undertaken analysis reveals that the speeches are aimed at creating four main types of resistance effect: solo, depicting Ukraine as a single fighter against the aggressor during the first days of the war; united, portraying the support of other countries throughout the initial war period; bidirectional, implying Ukraine’s resistance to two aggressive sources; global, taking the struggle over to the international level.",

This article theorizes about the hub as a political center by putting it in a historical sociological perspective. I map the dynastic court and the capital city as ideal typical centers and contrast them with the multilateral hub as a real type. I argue that the court and the capital used to be conspicuous centers where the political authority of kings and governments became manifest, staged, and symbolically affirmed. The modern multilateral hub, in contrast, can be understood as a hidden center in which the political authority of professionals has moved to the background world of policy-making that is outside of the public gaze and devoid of symbolic representations. The article illustrates the professionalized politics of the multilateral hub with a case study on Brussels as the center of the European Union (EU).",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The paper contributes to a discussion of the syntactic expertise of ChatGPT. It focuses on its handling of the range of ‘syntactic puzzles’, such as ‘onion sentences’, ‘garden paths’, grammatical illusions and structural ambiguity. The parsing of such cases by humans dwells on the property of structure-dependence, which is not shared by the AI language generator – ChatGPT. The latter is believed to process sentences in a sequential, though not strictly linear fashion, not using either recursion or hierarchy, the two pillars of human structure dependence. The assessment of ChatGPT’s syntactic expertise is based on two experiments in which the language model is asked to interpret and judge acceptability of English examples displaying such peculiar syntax. This is preceded by ‘a training session’ in which the model’s understanding of the nuances of such cases is assessed. The outcome is then confronted with the results of two parallel questionnaire studies, with the same set of linguistic tasks, administered to a group of human respondents, untrained in linguistics, with a native-like proficiency in English.",

    "Abstract": "Resumen La relación comercial entre el Mercado Común del Sur (Mercosur) y la República Popular China (en adelante China) ha mostrado un importante crecimiento en las últimas dos décadas, transformando su estructura y composición, pero especialmente ampliando su alcance más allá del comercio de bienes e incorporando la inversión extranjera directa (IED) y la cooperación. Actualmente, las relaciones de China con los miembros del Mercosur, además de por el comercio, están pautadas por las inversiones, con la especial importancia de Brasil, la cooperación financiera como es el caso del SWAP en Argentina o la importancia creciente de renminbí en Brasil, ya sea como moneda de reserva o como divisa utilizada en el intercambio comercial con China. El artículo analiza la evolución de estas interacciones económicas, comerciales y estratégicas mediante indicadores de comercio, concentración de productos y grado de diversificación comercial y flujos de inversión, identificando las principales transformaciones acontecidas entre los años 2005 y 2024 que han sido clave en la agenda bilateral y en los patrones de dependencia. A través de la teoría de la interdependencia compleja, se evalúa si los cambios observados han generado una relación más simétrica con una red de vínculos más diversificada que se da por varios canales, o si persisten dinámicas de dependencia asimétrica. Asimismo, se abordan y discuten las implicaciones estratégicas para el Mercosur en el contexto del orden global actual donde China desempeña un papel fundamental, considerando tanto los riesgos como las oportunidades derivadas de esta interdependencia multidimensional.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Oxidative processes involving aminocarboxylate complexes and oxy-anions are intriguing for understanding cellular oxygen transport in biological systems. The proposed research aims to examine the implications of anionic, cationic, and neutral surfactants on the Ag + catalyzed peroxydisulphate (S 2 O 8 2− ) oxidation of [Co II CYDTA] 2− (CYDTA = trans-cyclohexane-1,2 diamine N,N,N′,N′-tetra acetic acid). The kinetics of oxidation in both aquatic and SLS/TX-100/CTAB micellar media are assessed by measuring an increase in absorbance at 538 nm. The impacts of pH, [Ag + ], [S 2 O 8 2− ], [Co II CYDTA 2− ], ionic strength, [Surfactant], and temperature were investigated. The inclusion of supplementary cations and the reaction medium’s ionic strength does not influence the reaction rate, indicating that the reaction occurs through the formation of ion pairs. Anions increased catalysis, suggesting an outer sphere mechanism. The analysis of various concentrations revealed that the reaction under investigation exhibited a first-order dependence on [Co II CYDTA 2− ], [Ag + ], and [S 2 O 8 2− ]. The presence of CTAB micelles facilitated approximately 3.3-fold enhancement in the oxidation rate. TX-100 moderately facilitates the oxidation of [Co II CYDTA] 2− , whereas SLS, an anionic surfactant, diminishes the oxidation rate. As a catalyst, CTAB exhibits the best compatibility with Ag + metal salt. The proposed mechanistic approach is further supported by the computed activation parameters.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We study the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice using several numerical approaches, focusing on the numerical linked-cluster expansion (NLCE), which exhibits an unconventional convergence extending to low and even zero temperatures. We evaluate thermodynamic properties as well as spin–spin correlations through the equal-time structure factor. Within NLCE, the specific heat capacity reveals a two-peak structure at T 1 ≈ 0.479 J and T 2 ≈ 0.131 J, reminiscent of the corresponding result for the triangular lattice. At intermediate temperatures, the spin–spin structure factor develops features that reflect the absence of reflection symmetry in the lattice. The zero-temperature convergence of NLCE enables reliable estimates of the ground-state energy and points to a short-range correlated paramagnetic ground state composed of resonating hexagonal motifs. The NLCE results are benchmarked against pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group, finite-temperature Lanczos, and classical Monte Carlo simulations.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Previous research investigated the interplay between impairments in personality functioning and perceived negative interactions with parents. Those studies mostly utilized cross-sectional methodologies in community samples. This study aimed to clarify the direction of associations between impaired personality functioning (i.e., difficulties in identity formation and less capacity of empathy and intimacy) and perceived negative interactions with parents (e.g., conflicts with parents) in treatment-referred youth. Methods: The sample consisted of 285 youth (79.3% self-identified women; M age = 19.1, SD = 2.58, range = 12-23 years) who completed questionnaires at three measurement points within one year. Data were analyzed with a Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model. Results: Results showed that impaired personality functioning is correlated with perceived negative interactions. However, an absence of reciprocal relationships between impaired personality functioning and perceived negative interactions with parents over time is found. Youth's impaired personality functioning is not related to youth's perceived negative interactions with parents 6 months later. Also, youth's negative interactions with parents are not associated with the personality functioning 6 months later. Discussion: Future research is needed to investigate other interpersonal factors (e.g., peer relationships, social support) that play a role in the development of personality functioning.",

    "Abstract": "To navigate the world, we store knowledge about relationships between concepts and retrieve this information flexibly to suit our goals. The semantic control network, comprising left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), is thought to orchestrate this flexible retrieval by modulating sensory inputs. However, interactions between semantic control and input regions are not sufficiently understood. Moreover, pMTG’s well-formed structural connections to IFG and visual cortex suggest it as a candidate region to integrate control and input processes. We used magnetoencephalography to investigate oscillatory dynamics during semantic decisions to pairs of words, when participants (both sexes) did or did not know the type of semantic relation between them. IFG showed increases and decreases in oscillatory activity to prior task knowledge, while pMTG only showed positive task knowledge effects. Furthermore, IFG provided sustained feedback to pMTG when task goals were known, while in the absence of goals this feedback was delayed until receiving bottom-up input from the second word. This goal-dependent feedback coincided with an earlier onset of feedforward signalling from visual cortex to pMTG, indicating rapid retrieval of task-relevant features. This pattern supports a model of semantic cognition in which pMTG integrates top-down control from IFG with bottom-up input from visual cortex to activate task-relevant semantic representations. Our findings elucidate the separate roles of anterior and posterior components of the semantic control network and reveal the spectro-temporal cascade of interactions between semantic and visual regions that underlie our ability to flexibly adapt cognition to the current goals. Significance Statement Using magnetoencephalography, we characterize the spectro-temporal dynamics that underlie our ability to flexibly adapt semantic cognition to the current context and goals. We find that semantic goals increase oscillatory activity in IFG and pMTG, and ultimately facilitate visual processing. Effective connectivity analyses reveal more sustained feedback from IFG to pMTG, and more rapid feedforward signalling from visual cortex to pMTG, resulting in rapid retrieval when semantic goals are known. Crucially, our findings suggest differential roles for the two semantic control regions: while IFG controls goal-dependent retrieval, pMTG integrates top-down information from IFG with bottom-up visual input.",

FC and her family are from a rural area approximately 4 hours from the nearest children’s hospital, and, despite multiple attempts by her family and their primary care pediatrician (PCP), they were unable to secure pediatric subspecialty appointments for further evaluation of her symptoms because of availability constraints. She was ultimately transferred to a quaternary care pediatric center where she was diagnosed with a rare histiocytic syndrome. Her family continues to struggle to access appropriate subspecialty care after hospital discharge and ultimately travels far from home frequently to receive care. We examine FC’s case using the socioecological model to highlight the disparities in access to subspecialty pediatric care for geographically isolated children and provide tangible steps to support high-quality and equitable health care for rural families and children.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND Evidence on the association between maternal diabetes and neurodevelopmental disorders in offspring, particularly epilepsy, remains limited and heterogeneous. Moreover, most studies have not distinguished among diabetes subtypes—type 1 (T1DM), type 2 (T2DM), and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)—which have distinct etiologies. This study examines the association among these diabetes subtypes and epilepsy in offspring. METHODS In a retrospective birth cohort of all in-hospital live births between 2002 and 2018 in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, linked with population maternal and child health records up until March 2020, we estimated the crude and adjusted association among T1DM, T2DM, and GDM and epilepsy in children aged younger than 18 years using Cox proportional hazards models. We examined the robustness of results using quantitative bias analyses. RESULTS Among 2 105 553 children, 160 644 (7.6%) were exposed to maternal diabetes (0.3% T1DM, 1.2% T2DM, and 6.1% GDM). Over a median follow-up of 10.2 years, 17 853 epilepsy cases were diagnosed. After adjusting for maternal socioeconomic and clinical characteristics, children exposed to maternal diabetes had an increased risk of epilepsy in all subcategories of diabetes compared with those unexposed (adjusted HR [aHR] for T2DM, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.24–1.58; aHR for T1DM, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03–1.69; and aHR for GDM, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.07–1.22). A longer duration of T1DM or T2DM was associated with an increased risk. These results were consistent in our quantitative bias analyses. CONCLUSION Maternal diabetes, particularly T1DM and T2DM, is associated with an increased epilepsy risk in offspring, with longer disease duration not significantly amplifying this risk. These findings suggest that prenatal metabolic and inflammatory exposures may contribute to the development of epilepsy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Grain growth, governed by the mobility and migration mechanisms of grain boundaries, is a fundamental process shaping the microstructure and properties of polycrystalline materials. This article explores the critical interplay between solute adsorption, disconnections, and complexion transitions in determining grain-boundary behavior. Traditional models based on curvature-driven motion are insufficient, as experimental and computational studies reveal complex mechanisms, including disconnection-mediated migration and transitions in structure or interface excess concentration. Solute atoms not only exert classical drag effects, but can also catalyze or suppress mobility by altering activation energies for disconnection formation or modifying boundary structures. The concept of grain-boundary complexions provides a thermodynamic framework for understanding structural and chemical transitions at interfaces, with direct implications for mobility. Special attention is given to ionic systems, where charge effects and electric fields further influence migration. Collectively, these insights highlight new strategies for tailoring grain growth to engineer advanced materials. Graphical abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Grain-boundary (GB) engineering is a fundamental tool in materials design. Ever-increasing power to resolve the atomistic structure of GBs has enabled the discovery of new GB phases and their transitions. GB phase transitions are characterized by changes in the atomistic configuration of GBs, often together with variations in their chemical composition. Such transitions can be induced by temperature, local stress state and chemical potential of the constituent elements. In this article, we highlight some exciting new frontiers in this regard. The discussion is grouped into GB faceting (noncongruent) transitions, congruent transitions of structural units, chemical segregation-induced premelting, and chemical ordering. Based on atomic-scale characterizations, excess quantities of GBs can be derived to understand their thermodynamics. Moreover, new methodologies have been developed to characterize local properties of GBs, offering direct probes on their structure–property relationships and guiding the rational design of materials with superior structural and functional properties.

This limitation is particularly pronounced in ultra-small nanoparticles, given their high surface-to-volume ratio and broken symmetry. Here, we conducted a computational study on the phase transitions and structural evolution of copper nanoparticles of varying sizes, specifically under ultra-high cooling rates. Utilizing the third-generation Charge-Optimized Many-Body (COMB3) potential, which dynamically calculates atomic charges, our simulations provided a more realistic description of surface effects and non-equilibrium processes. This revealed a size-dependent liquid–solid phase transition characterized by stable charge ordering and persistent surface electrical dipoles. In the solid state, an amorphous surface formed below the solidification temperature, subsequently becoming crystalline at lower temperatures. The highest magnitude charges are localized at crystalline plane contours, suggesting potentially reactive sites. Graphical abstract",

The findings demonstrate that the composites exhibit promising advantages for removing and degrading dyes commonly found in water bodies, achieving a degradation efficiency of Congo red above 90% using a composite dose of 3 g L −1 , even at dye concentrations lower than 20 mg L −1 . This research underscores the potential for sustainable synthesis of polysaccharide-based polyurethane/carbon quantum dots composite hydrogels, paving the way for developing high-performance, eco-friendly polymer materials for next-generation applications in environmental remediation and advanced engineering.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) bars have been used in reinforced-concrete (RC) members, because of their good mechanical behavior and non-corrosive nature. Nevertheless, its durability reduces when exposed to humidity and alkaline ions. It is well documented that epoxy-based and vinyl ester-based FRPs exhibit greater chemical resistance than polyester-based FRPs, which might suggest they maintain superior mechanical properties after exposure to chemical environments. However, recent studies have shown that polyester-based FRP bars can retain similar tensile properties even after alkaline aging. This paper presents an experimental program intending to investigate the hydrothermal effect in RC-beams, with polyester-based GFRP bars. Pre-cracked and uncracked GFRP-RC beams were immersed in distilled water at 60 °C for up to 6 months and then subjected to three-point bending, employing the digital image correlation (DIC) method to assess the cracking behavior. Uncovered GFRP bars were exposed to alkaline aging for comparison. The degradation of the bars was observed in both exposure environments; however, more severe results were observed in aged uncovered GFRP bars, showing a tensile strength retention of approximately 44% after six months. In scenarios with concrete-covered FRP bars, the strength retentions were near to 60%. Furthermore, pre-cracked beams exhibited more pronounced degradation when compared to those uncracked. The change in beams behavior was more pronounced in the first three months of aging, converging to a quasi-stable strength retention level. With the aid of DIC, large crack openings were observed for unaged GFRP-RC beams. At a similar level of bending load, these values decreased significantly after three months of aging; however, after six months of aging, the crack openings increased again. Furthermore, pre-cracking did not have a major influence on the value of crack-openings at peak loads.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Conventional red ceramic and concrete bricks and blocks are some of the main products used in civil construction. However, reducing the exploitation of natural resources and CO 2 emissions by replacing conventional materials with new waste-based alternatives is necessary. Alkali-activated cement (AAC) has been studied in recent years and has been identified as a possible alternative to Portland cement (PC). The present study proposes the development of bricks/blocks composed of rice husk ash (RHA), eggshell lime (ESL), and sodium hydroxide, without the use of conventional PC or fired ceramics. This study aims to evaluate the effect of molding pressure and, more importantly, how the resulting porosity influences the unconfined compressive strength (UCS), initial modulus of elasticity (E 0 ), and water absorption (WA) of alkali-activated lightweight bricks. Specimens were molded with dry unit weights (γ d ) of 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 kN/m 3 to obtain different porosities, thermally cured at 60 °C for 24 h, and tested at 7 days of age. The molding pressure, porosity, UCS, ultrasonic pulse velocities (UPV), E 0 , and WA were determined for each specimen. Results showed that porosity controlled the mechanical response (UCS and E 0 ) and the WA of the cemented matrix. Specimens with porosity lower than 56% (γ d ≥ 10 kN/m 3 ) meet strength requirements for use as structural blocks. Similarly, porosity lower than 55% (γ d ≥ 10 kN/m 3 ) is required to meet water absorption criteria, indicating that this is the minimum molding density to be used. Moreover, relationships between γ d , porosity, and molding pressure were established for practical applications. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results confirmed the polymerization reactions of the raw materials, leading to the formation of a C(N)–S–H gel in the cemented matrix.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective To investigate the seasonality of suicide mortality in Canada and explore differences across sex and age. Methods We analyzed monthly suicide deaths spanning January 2001 to December 2015 from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database. Data from 2016 onwards were not included in the main analysis as Ontario and Yukon data were unavailable due to data-sharing agreement limitations. However, data from 2016–2019 were included in the sensitivity analyses. Seasonal variations were assessed by evaluating the timing of peak and trough monthly suicide mortality rates, and amplitude (peak-to-trough risk ratio) overall and by sex and age groups. Statistical significance was tested using the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average procedure. Results With 40,405 recorded suicides, results indicated a peak in suicide rates in July (0.95 per 100,000 people), 6.74% higher than the monthly average, and a trough in February (0.78 per 100,000 people), 12.36% lower than the monthly average. The peak/trough relative risk (RR) was 1.22 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.47). Seasonality patterns were similar between sexes, but stronger and more stable among males. Seasonality patterns were similar across age groups, but the amplitude was larger among those aged 65+. Conclusions This study confirms seasonal patterns in suicide mortality in Canada, peaking during the summer months. Such patterns are more prominent and stable among males, and its amplitude was larger among older adults. Contrary to the common perception that suicide rates peak in January, our findings show a summer peak. Future research should explore the underlying mechanisms driving these seasonal variations and their demographic differences.",

    "Abstract": "This article investigates the hijrah phenomenon among urban Muslim youth in Indonesia as a search for stability, meaning, and moral clarity amid rapid social change and digital platform influence. Originally associated with physical migration, hijrah has evolved into a spiritual and lifestyle transformation shaped by personal reflection, online religious content, and community participation. Using a qualitative phenomenological approach—including in-depth interviews, participant observation, and social media analysis in Jakarta and Yogyakarta—the study finds that hijrah is often motivated by uncertainty, work pressure, emotional fatigue, and a desire for ethical guidance. Digital algorithms on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube amplify these motivations through “click moments,” where a single resonant video leads to further religious engagement. These encounters guide youth toward online preachers, virtual study groups, and offline communities, where hijrah is reinforced through routines, supportive networks, and symbolic expressions such as modest fashion and collective learning. The study demonstrates that hijrah constitutes a socio-technological process shaped by existential needs, algorithmic mediation, and collective identity formation, rather than merely a personal religious change.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the linguistic and communicative complexity of Matthew 5:1–12, commonly known as the Beatitudes, through the lens of Functional Sentence Perspective (FSP), a Praguian framework for analyzing information structure. As the opening segment of the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes introduce a vision of blessedness that is both spiritually resonant and rhetorically rich. The traditional title anticipates the central motif of the passage: a series of declarations describing who is blessed and why, framed within the eschatological context of the kingdom of heaven. Despite their apparent simplicity, these statements are semantically and pragmatically dense, even ambiguous—a feature that becomes particularly significant in FSP analysis. Situated within the broader sub-genre of biblical poetic texts, the Beatitudes are marked by ritualization, syntactic repetition, and a high degree of semantic condensation. These characteristics, while serving their pedagogical and liturgical functions, also pose challenges for FSP, especially given the fixed and culturally embedded nature of sacred texts. The study argues that the more a text is ritually and formally stabilized, the less amenable it becomes to unequivocal FSP interpretation. In the case of the Beatitudes, multiple plausible distributions of communicative dynamism (CD) exist, none of which can be definitively privileged. Thus, this analysis highlights the need for a nuanced interpretative approach that accounts for the unique structural and theological properties of poetic religious texts, deepening our understanding of how these texts continue to communicate meaning and authority across diverse contexts.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the pedagogical effectiveness of workshop-based learning for teaching novel façade materials in architecture school through an intensive ten-day collaborative learning intervention. The research addresses critical shortcomings in contemporary architectural education, including material innovation, the improvement of collaborative abilities, and the integration of theoretical knowledge with practical application. This study employed a mixed-methods approach. During the workshop, students were engaged in collaborative groups working on case studies in Istanbul, Turkey. The methodologies used for the workshop included design-based learning and case study analysis. The outcomes of the workshop show students’ progress through different domains. For example, understanding of technical content, design integration, problem-solving, and communication proficiency. By the end of the workshop, students could effectively create novel design concepts. This result highlights the technical performance, cultural awareness, and aesthetic unity. They presented a deep understanding of materials science principles. This experimental study suggests that such a collaborative workshop can be a solution to today’s architectural education challenges. Intensive and collaborative workshops are needed in contemporary education to improve the students’ technical skills and innovative thinking. This study’s framework can be applied as a model for different contexts. Such educational models can enhance the pedagogical practice in architectural education. The study highlights that group-organized learning environments improve students’ engagement and understanding of a career in architecture.",

    "Abstract": "Bandung, Indonesia, known for its rich colonial and modern architectural heritage, offers a distinctive urban context where historical narratives and spatial memory can be embedded into contemporary commercial spaces. However, many shops operating within heritage buildings neglect conservation principles and disregard the historical significance of the structures they occupy. Commercial interests often override preservation concerns, resulting in unsympathetic renovations, visual pollution, and the erasure of original architectural elements. Regulatory frameworks are frequently ignored due to limited awareness, weak enforcement, or short-term business priorities. These practices undermine the authenticity of the built environment and represent missed opportunities for place-based branding and meaningful spatial storytelling. This study addresses these challenges through three objectives: (1) identifying cases in Bandung and abroad where shops have integrated historical memory into the retail experience; (2) analyzing strategies used to embed memory within commercial interior design; and (3) formulating implementation models aligned with conservation goals in Bandung. Utilizing a qualitative research design and a comparative approach with selected international cases, the study draws on spatial analysis, archival research, and stakeholder interviews. The findings underscore the importance of living narrative that is supported by community in enhancing both heritage preservation and brand identity. Therefore, further study can be focused on integrative approaches that balance commercial objectives with cultural continuity.",

    "Abstract": "Background Digital health tools are increasingly vital in rural health care due to widespread hospital closures and the rapid adoption of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rural older adults, a uniquely vulnerable population, face barriers to accessing these tools due to rurality and usability challenges. Although a growing body of literature examines the acceptability and usability of digital tools among rural older adults, no study has synthesized this research to establish best practices. Objective This study aims to review existing literature on digital health tools for rural older adults, highlighting key lessons learned about their acceptability and identifying strategies to improve usability for this population. Methods Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, this study reviewed literature that investigated the role of digital health tools on the health outcomes of rural older adults (ie, at least 60 years old). The literature was retrieved from 5 electronic databases through June 2023. This study and all reviewed literature were conducted in the United States. Guided by a systematic process, 2 reviewers assessed relevant articles for eligibility, analyzed data, and extracted relevant content. The extracted findings were organized according to the evidence-based technology acceptance model, which assesses the acceptability of a technology by its usefulness, ease of use, and intention to use. Results The preliminary title review produced 7728 results, and 38 eligible manuscripts were included in the final review. Studies included both rural older adults and providers of rural older adults as participants. Digital health tools included, but were not limited to, videoconferencing, phone calls, telehealth monitoring, telemedicine appointments, and computer-based interventions. Findings on the usefulness of digital health tools by rural older adults were mixed. While digital health tools were useful for overcoming barriers to accessing care, these tools were less useful for rural older adults with limited digital literacy. Additionally, some studies described that the technology was easy but difficult to use when faced with environmental barriers, equipment issues, and discomfort with the technology. Rural older adults often reported an intention to use the technology after the study. Yet, on a few occasions, participants who preferred in-person care visits or did not have buy-in on the technology reported no intention to use the technology again. Conclusions Our review highlights that rural older adults and their providers generally view digital health tools as acceptable for delivering care and, in some cases, as a viable alternative to in-person clinic visits. While certain barriers impacted the acceptance of these tools among rural older adults, many of these challenges were not directly linked to their age or rural location; thus, they are potentially applicable to urban older adults.

    "Abstract": "Background To meet the needs of individuals diagnosed with autism, internet-based interventions have been developed with a variety of objectives. A deeper understanding of the mechanisms of change may help tailor interventions to individual needs. The communicative behaviors of individuals with autism participating in text-based internet-based interventions remain largely unexplored, as do their potential relations to clinical outcomes. An improved understanding of participants’ behaviors may help therapists better tailor support, promote engagement, and enhance treatment outcomes. Objective This study aimed to explore the communicative behaviors of individuals with autism participating in an internet-based intervention and to examine whether different behavioral patterns were associated with treatment outcomes or treatment adherence. Methods Messages from 34 participants enrolled in an 18-week internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy program were analyzed using abductive qualitative content analysis. Correlational analyses were used to examine the relationships between qualitative categories and change scores on outcome measures and rates of module completion. Results Fourteen behavioral categories were identified and grouped into three overarching domains: (1) “This is me,” which encompasses the participants’ narratives on identity, personality, autistic functioning, current and past circumstances, and worldview; (2) “Working with the treatment,” which included statements related to engagement with the treatment process; and (3) “I struggle,” which comprised of past and present negative experiences and challenges. Correlational analyses revealed associations between several behavioral categories and improvements in quality of life and treatment adherence. Conclusions The findings highlight the importance of self-narrative formulation among individuals with autism and suggest that certain communicative behaviors—particularly those involving identity reflection and recognition of treatment-related gains—were positively associated with therapeutic outcomes. The findings enhance our understanding of how individuals with autism engage in internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy and may serve as a valuable source of information for therapists when guiding expectations regarding client outcomes and identifying participants who may benefit from additional support.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Data linkage in pharmacoepidemiological research is commonly employed to ascertain exposures and outcomes or to obtain additional information on confounding variables. However, to protect patient confidentiality, unique patient identifiers are not provided, which makes data linkage across multiple sources challenging. The Saudi Real-World Evidence Network (SRWEN) aggregates electronic health records from various hospitals, which may require robust linkage techniques. Objective We aimed to evaluate and compare the performance of deterministic, probabilistic, and machine learning (ML) approaches for linking deidentified data of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) from the SRWEN and Ministry of National Guard Health Affairs electronic health record systems. Methods A simulation-based validation framework was applied before linking real-world data sources. Deterministic linkage was based on predefined rules, whereas probabilistic linkage was based on a similarity score–based matching. For ML, both similarity score–based and classification approaches were applied using neural networks, logistic regression, and random forest models. The performance of each approach was assessed using confusion matrices, focusing on sensitivity, positive predictive value, F 1 score, and computational efficiency. Results The study included linked data of 2247 patients with MS from 2016 to 2023. The deterministic approach resulted in an average F 1 score of 97.2% in the simulation and demonstrated varying match rates in real-world linkage: 1046/2247 (46.6%) to 1946/2247 (86.6%). This linkage was computationally efficient, with run times of &lt;1 second per rule. The probabilistic approach provided an average F 1 score of 93.9% in the simulation, with real-world match rates ranging from 1472/2247 (65.5%) to 2144/2247 (95.4%) and processing times ranging from approximately 0.1 to 5 seconds per rule. ML approaches achieved high performance ( F 1 score reached 99.8%) but were computationally expensive. Processing times ranged from approximately 13 to 16,936 seconds for the classification-based approaches and from approximately 13 to 7467 seconds for the similarity score–based approaches. Real-world match rates from ML models were highly variable depending on the method used; the similarity score–based approach identified 789/2247 (35.1%) matched pairs, whereas the classification-based approach identified 2014/2247 (89.6%). Conclusions Probabilistic linkage offers high linkage capacity by recovering matches missed by deterministic methods and proved to be both flexible and efficient, particularly in real-world scenarios where unique identifiers are lacking. This method achieved a great balance between recall and precision, enabling better integration of various data sources that could be useful in MS research.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The medical education of French family medicine residents involves active, socioconstructivist-inspired small-group courses useful for skill acquisition. This is challenged by the increasing gap between the growing number of residents and the limited number of teachers. Blended courses have the potential to address this issue by reducing the duration of face-to-face sessions while preserving small-group courses. Objective This study aimed to compare the effects of blended vs traditional, face-to-face, active, socioconstructivist learning on the acquisition of knowledge and skills by family medicine residents. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial to compare a blended course and a traditional course. The blended course involved 2.5 hours of asynchronous e-learning and a 3-hour face-to-face session. The traditional course involved 5.5 hours of face-to-face teaching. Both courses were grounded in socioconstructivist principles and actively engaged residents. The primary outcome was residents’ self-assessment of knowledge and skills. Secondary outcomes included satisfaction with knowledge- or skill-related learning objectives and academic achievement at 6 months. Results We included 155 family medicine residents (n=78, 50.3% in the blended course and n=77, 49.7% in the traditional course). There was no significant difference between groups regarding the primary outcome (mean difference 0.40 [maximum mean difference 20] points, 95% CI −0.21 to 1.02; P =.19; Cohen d =0.21). No significant differences were observed for the secondary outcomes except for knowledge self-assessment, which was higher in the blended course but not educationally meaningful (mean difference 0.40 [maximum possible 10] points, 95% CI 0.07-0.71; P =.02; Cohen d =0.39). Conclusions Blended courses can help sustain socioconstructivist small-group teaching methods while accommodating a growing family medicine resident population, with no deleterious impact on knowledge and skill self-assessments.",

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We performed metabolomic profiling in 10,163 Finnish men in the Metabolic Syndrome in Men (METSIM) study at baseline. Of these participants, 1,412 had prevalent T2D and 1,234 developed incident T2D during an average follow-up period of 13.6 years. We tested for associations of 979 named metabolites with prevalent T2D. For significant metabolites, we further evaluated their associations with 24 T2D-related laboratory measures of five groups and five T2D lifestyle-related risk factors. We performed an exploratory mediation analysis to examine the mediation effects of metabolites on incident T2D for the five risk factors. We evaluated metabolite associations with incident T2D and built exploratory metabolite predictive models for incident T2D. RESULTS We identified 193 plasma metabolites significantly associated with prevalent T2D at baseline, including 71 previously unreported. Of these 193 metabolites, 88 were associated with incident T2D. In participants with prevalent T2D, the 193 metabolites showed associations with zero to 24 (mean 10.2) T2D-related laboratory measures. Eighty-one metabolites partially mediated the associations of the five risk factors with T2D onset under standard mediation assumptions. The significant metabolites showed improved predictive ability for future T2D. CONCLUSIONS This study identifies T2D plasma metabolic biomarkers for further investigation in women and other populations. The findings enhance our understanding of T2D biology.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Towards the integration of an increasing penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) generation, the transition pattern in Europe requires careful planning and extensive investments in the electricity system. The needed RES integration especially concerns the electricity grids, as well as the enabling technologies and measures, which can ensure a clean, secure, flexible, and efficient energy supply. In particular, in the context of the integration of large-scale RES generation, the development of adequate HVAC (High Voltage Alternating Current) and HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) transmission infrastructures and innovative technologies plays an increasingly pivotal role. The technological progress in power electronics over the latest twenty years has contributed to make HVDC more widespread also in terms of new applications. This has also impacted on the development of FACTS (Flexible Alternating Current Transmission System) devices that have recently seen a constant increase in penetration and deployment in the European power system. Both HVDC and FACTS technologies, with their flexibility increase capability, can play a crucial role towards the facilitation of RES integration. Within the European background and considering Italian experiences, the present paper first provides an updated overview of key features and benefits of different FACTS and HVDC technologies. These elements may support the European transmission network planners in their decision-making. Particular attention is devoted to the still open and crucial challenges that regard the further penetration of HVDC and FACTS technologies in the European and Italian system context.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Hydropower sector is undergoing a transformation of replacing old analog control systems and leveraging the effect of digitalization to increase operational flexibility, production and safety using digital elements like sensors, wireless platforms, real time monitoring, predictive maintenance and decision support systems etc.. Implementation of digitalization to hydropower plants has a potential of 42 TWh increase in annual production worldwide, hence creates a potential for USD 5 billion annual operational cost savings and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. One of the critical and common applications of digitalization in hydropower sector is unmanned/remote operated hydropower plants, of which there are several examples of in the Water-Energy nexus projects. In Water Distribution Networks (WDN), Pressure Reduction Valves (PRV) are the most common tools to manage excessive pressure due to the topography, resulting in energy waste. To harvest this waste energy, micro hydropower plants can be used for pressure reduction and the harvested energy can be used in remote areas lacking grid connectivity or directly supplied to the local grid. Digitalization has potential advantages on both micro, mini and small sized hydropower plants installed in water networks such as optimal control of water pressure using digital twins of the WDNs, autonomous operation of the plants and proactive or predictive maintenance to ensure trouble-free operation. In this paper, we present the insights from a technical point of view from a practical Water-Energy nexus project and from a short term scientific mission study conducted with a COST action PEN@Hydropower member institute. This research aims to reveal main challenges to be encountered during implementation of digital control and monitoring solutions in a small hydropower plant, including hands on observations during erection, commissioning and operation phases. Review on data collection and storage issues from critical equipment, cleaning out the collected data for analysis and machine learning applications, cyber security issues brought by digital transformation along with the convenience in installation and operation it brings is presented as a guide for future research.",

Over the course of a year, TNs occurred from May to August, most often in July (47% of cases), but they are becoming increasingly common from as early as June. TNs have been observed to occur increasingly frequently in sequences of several days – of up to five in a row. There were 20 cases when TNs occurred at all four stations studied at the same time, and as many as 16 of these were noted in 2010–2024. The greatest number of TNs were recorded at stations in the centre of Warsaw, close to built-up areas, and the lowest at stations far from the centre, confirming that the urban heat island has a significant influence on the occurrence of TNs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the traditional standard of care for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) at high surgical risk, but recently it has been increasingly used for treating patients with intermediate as well as low operative risk. Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is generally the first-line strategy for treating abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) particularly for infrarenal AAAs meeting the anatomical necessary criteria. The association between AS and AAA is increasing due to the increased life expectancy. Only a limited number of combined TAVR and EVAR procedures have been reported in the literature, each utilizing different strategies and device choices tailored to individual patient anatomy and risk profiles. In the absence of clear clinical guidelines, several challenges remain in identifying the optimal management approach for patients with both severe AS and AAA. Objective This paper explores the current trends in the treatment of patients with severe symptomatic AS and concomitant large infrarenal AAA, particularly in those at high surgical risk. We present two representative cases managed with a combined TAVR and EVAR approach, highlighting the procedural advantages and risks and decision-making challenges. The implementation of this innovative, minimally invasive strategy may in some cases significantly reduce both hospitalization time and periprocedural complications. Conclusion With growing clinical experience, this combined approach may evolve into a standard of care for carefully selected high-risk individuals.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Large to massive rotator cuff tears (RCTs) are challenging to handle because of tendon retraction, fatty infiltration, and limited mobility. In elderly patients, these tears often raise the question of primary arthroplasty. This study computed the clinical, functional, and radiological outcomes of arthroscopic single-row, tension-free repair in such patients. Materials and Methods: Thirty-five patients receiving arthroscopic single-row repair for large to massive RCTs were prospectively followed for a minimum of 24 months. Clinical outcomes were analyzed using Constant–Murley and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) scores. Tendon healing was assessed by ultrasonography, leveraging the Sugaya classification. Results: All patients demonstrated significant post-operative improvements. The constant score increased from 50.6 ± 10.18 to 91.43 ± 7.56 ( P &lt; 0.00015) and the UCLA score from 18.03 ± 4.47 to 33.31 ± 2.68 ( P &lt; 0.00022). Active forward flexion improved from 72.00 ± 29.08° to 152.57 ± 11.20° ( P &lt; 0.00025) and external rotation from 54.86 ± 12.22° to 77.43 ± 11.72° ( P &lt; 0.00034). Ultrasonographic evaluation showed a re-tear rate of 11.4%, with preserved function even in re-tear cases. Conclusion: Arthroscopic single-row, tension-free repair yields reliable mid-term improvements in function, pain relief, and tendon healing for large to massive RCTs in elderly patients. The technique offers a viable alternative to primary arthroplasty.",

We report a case of a 20-year-old woman who presented with persistent hyperpigmented and hypertrichotic plaques over the interdigital web spaces of both hands. She had undergone syndactyly-release surgery in infancy with full-thickness medial thigh grafts. Dermoscopy revealed linear crista cutis with brown dots. Histopathology demonstrated hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, and basal layer pigmentation, confirming ectopic AN. Metabolic parameters were normal.Ectopic AN likely represents a reactive epidermal phenomenon in grafted skin due to epidermal–dermal mismatch and altered growth factor signaling.

Material and Methods: RG Mother tincture ( Q ) and TBP Q , along with their potencies (6C, 12C and 30C), were analysed using 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH)-free radical scavenging and ferric ion reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays to determine the antioxidant power of the substances. In addition, the total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC) of both RG Q and TBP Q were assessed. Results: The findings indicated that RG Q inhibits the DPPH-free radical at 128.89 µg/mL of ascorbic acid equivalents (AAE) and the FRAP-free radical at 97.16 µg/mL of AAE. TBP Q demonstrated inhibition of the DPPH-free radical at 111.96 µg/mL of AAE and FRAP-free radical at 97.74 µg/mL of AAE. The TPC of RG Q at 100 µg/mL was 359.6 µg/mL and for TBP Q at 100 µg/mL, it was 210.8 µg/mL of gallic acid equivalents. The TFC of RG Q at 100 µg/mL was 313.37 µg/mL, while for TBP Q at 100 µg/mL, it was 89.6 µg/mL of quercetin equivalents. Conclusion: The study concluded that ethanolic extracts of RG and TBP exhibit antioxidant potential and contain substantial concentrations of phenols and flavonoids.",

    "Abstract": "Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) have gained prominence as tools to integrate competencies with authentic clinical work. While EPAs are conceptually compatible with undergraduate (UG) health professions education, their adoption as the primary organising framework at this level is neither educationally sound nor regulatorily defensible. This article argues that UG homoeopathy education should remain firmly grounded in competency-based education (CBE), with EPAs employed selectively as developmental and integrative tools. UG learners are pre-professionals who function under close supervision and do not yet possess the legal or ethical authority for independent clinical responsibility. A CBE-led curriculum ensures clarity of outcomes, graded progression and patient safety, while judicious use of EPAs, particularly in the final year and internship, can support the transition to supervised professional practice. This integrated educational-policy perspective proposes a balanced model that preserves the conceptual integrity of both CBE and EPAs while aligning with international best practices and the regulatory realities of UG homoeopathy education in India.",

    "Abstract": "Background Patient–ventilator asynchronies (PVAs) are common during mechanical ventilation and are associated with adverse outcomes. While most research has focused on ventilator modes, pulmonary mechanics, and sedation, the influence of routine clinical practices remains largely unexplored. Objectives To document ventilatory asynchronies induced by routine clinical practices through systematic observation and to contrast these findings with a structured scoping review of the literature. Methods Systematic observation of ventilator waveforms was performed during routine clinical interventions in critically ill patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. In parallel, a scoping review was conducted across five databases (Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed, LILACS, and Cochrane), guided by the PCC framework (Population, Concept, and Context) and PRISMA-ScR recommendations. Study selection was carried out independently by two reviewers using Rayyan software, with disagreements resolved by consensus. Results Thirteen studies were included in the scoping review; only three addressed the eight PVAs described in the literature, and none reported induced asynchronies as a cause or risk factor. Our observational analysis demonstrated that routine interventions such as respiratory care, repositioning, and intrahospital transfers may trigger transient episodes of PVA. Conclusions Routine clinical practices,including suctioning, repositioning, and intrahospital transport, can unintentionally induce PVAs. To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon has not previously been reported in the literature, as confirmed by our scoping review. These findings highlight an overlooked source of asynchrony with potential clinical implications.",

    "Abstract": "Lumbar endoscopic unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression (LE-ULBD) is a minimally invasive procedure designed to treat lumbar spinal stenosis. While traditional uniportal endoscopic decompression already reduces tissue damage and promotes faster recovery compared to open surgery, this work introduces standardized terminology and specific endoscope-camera maneuvers to improve visualization and precision during both ipsilateral and contralateral decompression. By describing endoscope (\"shaft\") and camera head (\"optic\") rotations in a degree-degree format (e.g., 0-0, 90-0, 135-135, 180-180), the technique allows reproducible, targeted access to key anatomical areas while minimizing unnecessary bone removal. This systematic approach addresses the steep learning curve and technical intricacies of lumbar endoscopy, aiding intraoperative communication and potentially decreasing complications from inadequate decompression or poor visualization. The method aims to improve training, safety, and consistency of outcomes in endoscopic lumbar decompression procedures stenosis.",

    "Abstract": "Reliable nebular emission line diagnostics are essential for accurately inferring the physical properties (e.g. electron temperature, density, pressure, and metallicity) of H~{II} regions from spectra. When interpreting spectra, it is typical to adopt a single zone model, e.g. at fixed density, pressure, or temperature, to infer H~{II} region properties. However, such an assumption may not fully capture the complexities of a turbulent interstellar medium. To understand how a complex density field driven by supersonic turbulence impacts nebular emission lines, we simulate 3D H~{II} regions surrounding a single O star, both with and without supersonic turbulence. We find that turbulence directly impacts the values of common strong line ratios. For example turbulent H~{II} regions exhibit systematically higher [N~{II}]/H <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"> <mml:mi>α</mml:mi> </mml:math> , lower [O~{III}]/H <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"> <mml:mi>β</mml:mi> </mml:math> , and lower O32, compared to homogeneous H~{II} regions with the same mean density and ionizing source. These biases can impact inferences of metallicity, ionization parameter, excitation, and ionization source. For our choice of turbulence, direct <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"> <mml:msub> <mml:mi>T</mml:mi> <mml:mi>e</mml:mi> </mml:msub> </mml:math> method metallicity inferences are biased low, by up to 0.1~dex, which is important for metallicity studies, but not enough to explain the abundance discrepancy problem. Finally, we show that large differences between measured electron densities emerge between infrared, optical, and UV density indicators. Our results motivate the need for large grids of turbulent H~{II} regions models that span the range of conditions seen at both high and low redshift to better interpret observed spectra.",

    "Abstract": "Myopia, particularly high myopia, is a significant risk factor for several ocular pathologies including cataract, glaucoma, and retinal detachment. Excessive axial elongation associated with high myopia can induce biomechanical stretching, increasing the risk of serious complications like posterior staphyloma and myopic maculopathy. Global meta-analyses estimate that approximately 10 million people were visually impaired due to myopic maculopathy in 2015, with 3 million being blind. Recent nationwide surveys in Korea revealed a prevalence of 65.4% for myopia and 6.9% for high myopia in children and adolescents, highlighting the urgent need for effective management. Delaying the onset and slowing the progression of myopia during childhood and adolescence is crucial for reducing the potential lifetime risk of these complications. This consensus statement, prepared by the Korean Myopia Society for KAPOS (Korean Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus), reviews the current evidence for myopia control interventions and provides management strategies applicable to the Korean clinical setting. Key interventions covered include lifestyle modifications (outdoor time, near work adjustment), optical methods (myopia-control spectacle lenses, dual-focus soft contact lenses, orthokeratology), and pharmacologic treatment (low-concentration atropine), as well as combination therapies. The statement also addresses patient selection, treatment outcome evaluation using spherical equivalent (SE) and axial length (AL) changes, and the crucial aspects related to treatment cessation and the rebound effect.",

    "Abstract": "Magnetorheological (MR) fluids are composite materials composed of ferromagnetic particles, medium oils, and several types of additives. MR fluids are particularly suitable for haptic applications, because their rheological properties can be rapidly, stably, and reversibly controlled using an applied magnetic field, MR fluids are particularly suitable for haptic applications. Moreover, with recent advances in virtual reality technologies, handheld haptic interfaces that offer high portability and operability, owing to their lightweight and compact design, have become increasingly important for enhancing immersion in teleoperation systems. In this study, we design and develop a miniature MR fluid device for handheld haptic interfaces using a cylindrical rotor. The proposed device is compact and light, and exhibits a high output. We analyzed the magnetic field distribution inside the device using an analytical model and confirmed that the serpentine magnetic flux path effectively increased the magnetic flux density in the MR fluid working region. According to the experimental characterization, the device generated a maximum torque of 0.3 Nm. The resulting interface had a total mass of 122 g and provided a maximum force of 4.5 N to the user, demonstrating its suitability for teleoperation and virtual reality applications.",

The need for a solution that facilitates the fast adaptation of administration to social context and people’s feedback becomes mandatory in order to ensure better services and implement projects that are in concordance with needs. In this paper, we propose a sandbox solution that helps public administration better understand community problems in real time, allocate public money more effectively to projects that really matter, and assess the administration’s performance. We started by collecting, filtering and analyzing social platforms posts and comments for 95 municipalities, and we extracted both the impressions/sentiment, but also the real problems that the communities are facing. Also, we categorized all cities depending on population, geographical area, and historical area to better identify common problems and create clusters of topics based on this split. We identified the most common issues communities face and integrated all the information into a sandbox that can be easily used by local administration for reactive decision-making and by central administration to provide a better overview of how public money is spent and whether the decisions align with needs. The results show that there is a real need for a sandbox to bring more clarity to the central and local administration layers and also better connect administrations with the people.",

    "Abstract": "Adolescent tobacco use remains a critical public health challenge, requiring innovative early prevention strategies. This study participatively evaluated a medium-fidelity prototype of the No le entres app, designed to prevent tobacco use among adolescents. The prototype was developed based on user-centered design and gamification frameworks, with the aim of ensuring cultural relevance and active user engagement. Qualitative design with content analysis was employed. Four focus groups were conducted in Xalapa, Veracruz: two with health professionals from Medical Specialty Units—Community Mental Health and Addiction Centers (UNEME CECOSAMA), and two with secondary school students. Nineteen professionals and twenty-two adolescents participated. Data were analyzed using MAXQDA 2022, applying both a priori and emergent categories. Professionals valued the app’s innovative approach but recommended improvements in navigation speed, visual design, message clarity, and cultural validation. Adolescents emphasized the need for more engaging features, such as music, rewards, team competitions, and updated graphics. Both groups highlighted the importance of interactivity, personalization, and contextualized content. Findings underscore the value of participatory methods in designing digital health interventions and confirm that involving end users enhances usability and acceptability. The app demonstrates potential for integration into school settings as a preventive tool, with implications for influencing adolescent knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding tobacco use.",

    "Abstract": "Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UASs) offer a promising future for aviation operations, even though it suffers larger cyber-related challenges. As such, cyber-resilience becomes a core property for drones’ operations. This paper presents a systematic meta-review of the scientific literature on Unmanned Aircraft Systems cyber-resilience, starting from 28 literature reviews and surveys in the field. This study examines three areas: the typologies of cyber threats being investigated, the cyber-resilience aspects and functions, and how proposed mitigation strategies align with and support these resilience functions. Overall, 69 cyber threats were identified, where Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofing and jamming were the most frequent ones, underscoring the vulnerability of GPS-based navigation systems in UAS. In terms of cyber-resilience functions, the largest focus remains on the identification, protection, and detection of cyber threats, while limited attention emerges to incident handling and post-event recovery. This is confirmed by the higher frequency of preventive, rather than recovery-oriented, mitigation strategies. Overall, the findings point towards a still limited cyber-resilience implementation for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, witnessing the need for more systemic efforts to guarantee truly resilient UAS operations.",

    "Abstract": "Detecting rice leaf diseases in real-world field environments remains challenging due to varying lesion sizes, diverse lesion morphologies, complex backgrounds, and the limited availability of high-quality annotated datasets. Existing detection models often suffer from performance degradation under these conditions, particularly when training data lack sufficient diversity and structural realism. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Latent Diffusion Inpainting (LDI) data augmentation method and an improved lightweight detection model, LGH-YOLOv12n. Unlike conventional diffusion-based augmentation methods that generate full images or random patches, LDI performs category-aware latent inpainting, synthesizing realistic lesion patterns by jointly conditioning on background context and disease categories, thereby enhancing data diversity while preserving scene consistency. Furthermore, LGH-YOLOv12n improves upon the YOLOv12n baseline by introducing GSConv in the backbone to reduce channel redundancy and enhance lesion localization, and integrating Hierarchical Multi-head Attention (HMHA) into the neck network to better distinguish disease features from complex field backgrounds. Experimental results demonstrate that LGH-YOLOv12n achieves an F1 of 86.1% and an mAP@50 of 88.3%, outperforming the YOLOv12n model trained without data augmentation by 3.3% and 5.0%, respectively. Moreover, when trained on the LDI-augmented dataset, LGH-YOLOv12n consistently outperforms YOLOv8n, YOLOv10n, YOLOv11n, and YOLOv12n, with mAP@50 improvements of 4.6%, 5.2%, 1.9%, and 2.1%, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed LDI augmentation and LGH-YOLOv12n model provide an effective and robust solution for rice leaf disease detection in complex field environments.",

    "Abstract": "Durum wheat productivity in Mediterranean regions faces growing challenges from drought and heat stress. Understanding the genetic architecture of diverse germplasm is therefore essential to support pre-breeding efforts and enhance stress adaptation. In this context, 125 durum wheat genotypes were evaluated for agro-morphological traits across two contrasting Algerian locations over two growing seasons. A subset of 94 genotypes, selected on the basis of phenotypic characterization, was genotyped using the Illumina 7K SNP array. Population structure analysis revealed two to four subgroups, with linkage disequilibrium decaying at 4.09 Mb. Genome-wide association analysis identified 27 distinct significant SNPs associated with eight traits, with most associations detected for spike length, thousand-kernel weight, and plant height. The marker TGWA25K-TG0010 on chromosome 4A showed pleiotropic effects on plant height and peduncle length and co-localized with the Dwarf8 and gibberellic-acid-insensitive genes. Additionally, wsnp_Ex_c2033_3814035 on chromosome 2A was associated with heading earliness and the number of fertile spikelets per spike, and wsnp_Ku_c51039_56457361 on chromosome 5A with plant height and peduncle length in a single site and season. Several other environment-specific associations were also identified. These results support future studies in which the identified markers may be deployed in breeding strategies aimed at improving yield stability and stress adaptability in durum wheat under Algerian conditions.",

    "Abstract": "This work aims to demonstrate the successful, long-term human use of an automatic scheduling-manual operation (AS-MO) precision irrigation tool by farmers on a medium-scale Jordanian farm. Innovation in low-cost, accessible, and water-efficient irrigation technologies is critical as water resources become scarce, especially on resource-constrained farms in the drought-prone Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Prior work has shown that a proposed AS-MO decision support tool could bridge the gap between fully manual irrigation—a common practice on many MENA farms—and existing precision agriculture solutions, which are often too expensive or complex for medium-scale farmers to adopt. Recent developments have also demonstrated that the scheduling theory behind the proposed AS-MO tool uses up to 44% less water compared to fully manual irrigation. However, a functional design of the AS-MO tool has not been realized nor has it been demonstrated on a farm with farmer users. This work documents the detailed design of an AS-MO tool’s human–machine interaction (HMI) and validates the human execution of the tool in context. Through an 11-week case study conducted on a Jordanian farm, we show that farmers used a functional prototype of the AS-MO tool as intended. The functional tool prototype was designed to deliver a long-term AS-MO user experience to study participants. The prototype monitored local weather conditions, generated water-efficient schedules using an existing scheduling theory, and notified users’ phones when they should manually open or close valves. The irrigation practices of participants using the AS-MO prototype were measured, and participants demonstrated successful use of the tool. Users correctly confirmed 93% of the scheduled events using the tool’s HMI. Despite manual operation, a majority of confirmed irrigation event durations fell within 15% of the automatically scheduled durations; relative to the length of scheduled irrigation event durations, the medians of confirmed and scheduled durations were 102% and 88%, respectively. These results demonstrate the success of the tool’s decision support ability. Feedback from study participants can support the AS-MO tool’s next design iteration and can inform the development of other decision support systems designed for resource-constrained, medium-scale farms. This work presents an important step towards developing a precision irrigation tool that, if adopted at scale, could increase the adoption of water-efficient irrigation practices on resource-constrained farms that are not served by existing technology, improving sustainable agriculture in MENA.",

    "Abstract": "Sowing represents one of the most critical technological processes in grain production, where seed distribution uniformity directly impacts crop yield by determining plant nutrition area efficiency. Conventional sowing methods with varying row spacings often fail to ensure optimal area utilization. This study enhances subsoil-broadcast sowing quality through a novel trough-profile seed guide that ensures uniform seed distribution across the sweep opener’s working width. The research employed a combined methodology of theoretical analysis, DEM simulation, and experimental studies. Theoretical analysis demonstrated that sowing parameters depend mainly on seeder forward speed and the rotational speed of the seed-metering device’s rollers. DEM simulations visually confirmed the mechanism of ordered seed flow formation within the guide. Experiments simulated drill seeder operation, evaluating forward speed (1.2–2.4 m/s) and fluted roller rotational speed (20–25 rpm) effects on distribution uniformity and sowing instability. The results at 20 rpm with 2.0–3.0 grains per cell showed a standard deviation reaching 0.2–0.5 pcs. (CV: 13.0–24.2%). At 25 rpm, the deviation increased to 0.5–1.0 pcs. (CV: 18.2–39.4%). For total sowing instability at 20 rpm with 10.0–15.0 grains per opener, the standard deviation measured 0.3–3.3 pcs. (CV: 2.8–22.4%), while at 25 rpm, with 15.0–19.0 grains, values reached 0.5–3.9 pcs. (CV: 3.5–19.8%). All parameters conform to agrotechnical requirements, confirming solution effectiveness and addressing the literature gap in uniform seed distribution across the sweep opener’s working width.",

    "Abstract": "The foliar pathogens of wheat, particularly Zymoseptoria tritici and Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, represent a significant threat to yield. We used a SEIR (Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Removed) model to quantify epidemic dynamics based on different fungicide application strategies, focusing on the daily dynamic growth rate r(t) (net infection increase) and the removal rate γ(t) (loss infectious tissue) after BBCH 37. In Scenario A (treatment of seed with Systiva®), the r(t) of Z. tritici was positive only during the early phase of the epidemic, followed by progressive suppression over time, while the r(t) for P. tritici-repentis remained negative throughout. Scenario B (seed treatment combined with foliar propiconazole) resulted in uniformly negative r(t) values for both pathogens, indicating stronger and sustained suppression. These findings highlight the practical utility of epidemic growth rate modeling for evaluating fungicide strategies and support integrated seed + foliar applications as a robust approach to disease management in wheat.",

    "Abstract": "Respiratory diseases and welfare impairments impose substantial economic and ethical burdens on modern broiler production, driven by high stocking density, rapid pathogen transmission, and limited sensitivity of conventional monitoring methods. Because respiratory pathology and stress directly alter vocal behavior, acoustic monitoring has emerged as a promising non-invasive approach for continuous flock-level surveillance. This review synthesizes recent advances in audio classification and artificial intelligence for monitoring respiratory health and welfare in broiler chickens. We have reviewed the anatomical basis of sound production, characterized key vocal categories relevant to health and welfare, and summarized recording strategies, datasets, acoustic features, machine-learning and deep-learning models, and evaluation metrics used in poultry sound analysis. Evidence from experimental and commercial settings demonstrates that AI-based acoustic systems can detect respiratory sounds, stress, and welfare changes with high accuracy, often enabling earlier intervention than traditional methods. Finally, we discuss current limitations, including background noise, data imbalance, limited multi-farm validation, and challenges in interpretability and deployment, and outline future directions for scalable, robust, and practical sound-based monitoring systems in broiler production.",

    "Abstract": "To date, radiographically identifying the bony landmarks relevant to diagnosing the complete C6 aplasia of the caudal lamina ventralis (C6 aCLV4) has not been described. Furthermore, a gross study has identified C6 aCLV4 as the main correlation between transposition of the CLV from C6 to C7, where coinciding neck pain was commonly reported. This study aimed to identify C6 aCLV4 in radiographs, where the outcome might benefit equine practitioners in isolating neck pain. Initially, the relevant bony landmarks were radiographically determined from a normal C6 by applying a lateral 30° dorsal–ventral oblique view. From here, the caudal border of the transverse process (TP) projecting from the vertebral body became the defining point of reference due to the image clearly demarcating the adjacent CLV. In C6 aCLV4 cases, the CLV is completely aplastic caudal to the TP. Twenty mixed-breed horses (13 males/7 females) aged 3–22 years radiographically demonstrated a C6 aCLV4, which was confirmed by their corresponding gross morphology. During this process three anomalous variations became apparent—in the longus colli muscle, C7 foramen transversarium, and vertebral artery. Therefore, this study demonstrates effective techniques for identifying C6 aCLV4 in horses, where the results might assist veterinarians in diagnosing neck pain while providing anatomical clarity.",

    "Abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) is a type of small non-coding RNA that influences various biological processes by targeting gene expression. However, the roles of microRNA in mediating ruminant mammary cell proliferation and survival remain poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate how miR-215-5p regulates cell cycle and apoptosis-related genes in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs). The effects of miR-215-5p on cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry. A combination of bioinformatics analysis was conducted to predict the target genes of miR-215-5p; this was followed by experimental validation using techniques such as luciferase reporter assays. The effects of CTCF, the targeting gene of miR-215-5p, on cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by qRT-PCR, Western blot and flow cytometry in GMECs. The study demonstrated that miR-215-5p induced cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase and promoted apoptosis in GMECs. Mechanistically, miR-215-5p downregulated CTCF expression by directly targeting its 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR). This miR-215-5p-mediated depletion of CTCF inhibits CDK2 and CDK6 activity, consequently downregulating genes involved in cell-cycle progression. Furthermore, the miR-215-5p/CTCF axis was found to promote apoptosis by downregulating the protein expression of Bcl-xL and upregulating the gene expression of Bax. In summary, miR-215-5p suppresses GMEC proliferation and survival through CTCF-dependent histone modifications.",

Pregnant ewes were fed 100% (CON), 60% (RES), or 140% (OVER) of their requirements from day 30 of gestation until parturition. Male offspring were necropsied at 282 ± 1.8 days of age. Gene expression and CSA were quantified in the longissimus (LM) and semitendinosus (STN) muscles. The Warner–Bratzler shear force (WBSF) was quantified in LM. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, with diet as a fixed effect. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05 or a tendency at p ≤ 0.10. Semitendinosus CSA was smaller in OVER and RES than CON rams (p = 0.02). Longissimus CSA was larger in RES than OVER and CON rams (p = 0.002). OVER LM had reduced WBSF compared with CON rams (p = 0.03). Myogenic genes bone morphogenic protein 1 (BMP1) and paired box 7 were greater in RES LM than OVER (p ≤ 0.02).

While Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) as a source of infection has been well characterized in shoulder surgery, its presentation and clinical significance in total hip (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain less understood. Methods: A retrospective chart review identified patients with C. acnes culture positivity following THA or TKA. Demographics, laboratory values, and microbiologic data were collected. Statistical comparisons were performed using t-tests and chi-squared analysis. One-year outcomes were evaluated using the Musculoskeletal Infection Society Outcome Reporting Tool (MSIS ORT) criteria among patients undergoing further surgical intervention. Results: Twenty-nine patients with C. acnes-positive cultures were identified (21 THA, 8 TKA); 15 (52%) were polymicrobial. Ten THA patients (47.6%) and seven TKA patients (87.5%) met MSIS criteria for infection at the time of presentation. Mean time to culture positivity was similar between THA (6.8 days) and TKA (7.4 days; p = 0.57). Sonicated cultures were positive in 24% of THA and 12.5% of TKA cases. Mean ESR was 36.4 mm/h for THA and 51.5 mm/h for TKA (p = 0.21); mean C-reactive protein (CRP) was 35.2 and 36.8 mg/dL, respectively (p = 0.95). Mean synovial cell counts were 27,055 for THA and 22,194 for TKA, with polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) percentages of 68% and 73.9% (p = 0.72, 0.70). Monomicrobial infections demonstrated a mean cell count of 24,143 with 58.9% PMNs, compared to 25,903 and 78.8% in polymicrobial cases. At one year, 72% of patients undergoing subsequent surgery achieved successful outcomes. Higher ASA classification was the only significant predictor of failure (mean 3.0 vs. 2.75). Conclusions: C. acnes-associated THA and TKA infections often present with delayed culture growth, mild inflammatory markers, and frequent polymicrobial involvement. At one-year, patients with available follow-up who undergo surgical management experience favorable outcomes, with 72% achieving MSIS ORT success.",

    "Abstract": "Oxidative stress-induced lipid peroxidation products (LPPs), particularly 4-hydroxy-nonenal (4-HNE) and 4-oxo-nonenal (4-ONE), have recently gained attention for their direct regulation of ion channels essential for pain signaling. In this study, we investigated how these two LPPs affect the electrophysiological properties of neurons, specifically voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels, thereby influencing sensory neuron excitability and pain pathways. Using human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) and ND7/23 cells (a fusion cell line exhibiting partial sensory neuron properties), we measured changes in NaV channel-mediated sodium currents following treatment with 4-HNE or 4-ONE. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments showed that 4-ONE (10 µM) and 4-HNE (100 µM) did not significantly alter the peak sodium current amplitude in SH-SY5Y cells. However, in ND7/23 cells, both 4-HNE and 4-ONE induced a negative shift in NaV channel activation voltage dependence, enabling sodium channel activation at lower membrane potentials. Furthermore, current-clamp recordings in primary mouse dorsal root ganglion neurons demonstrated that treatment with 4-ONE and 4-HNE reduced the current threshold required to elicit action potentials and significantly increased action potential firing frequency. These findings indicate that LPPs enhance pain sensitivity by modulating NaV channels, which play a crucial role in pain transmission. In conclusion, 4-HNE and 4-ONE shift the voltage-dependent activation of sodium channels toward more negative potentials, thereby increasing the excitability of primary sensory neurons and amplifying pain signals. This study provides molecular insights into how oxidative stress-related lipid peroxidation contributes to sensory mechanisms and offers potential avenues for developing new treatments for oxidative stress- or inflammation-associated pain.",

    "Abstract": "This study proposes a video-based approach for quantitatively evaluating upper-limb joint abnormalities in individuals with brain lesions during resistance exercises. While the Fugl–Meyer Assessment (FMA) is a reliable clinical tool, its use is limited by the need for expert involvement and repeated assessments. To address this issue, skeletal joint data were extracted from RGB exercise videos using OpenPose, and joint abnormalities were identified by learning normal movement patterns from non-disabled participants. A total of 26 non-disabled individuals and 12 individuals with brain lesions performed chest press, shoulder press, and arm curl exercises. Joint movement patterns were analyzed using correlation analysis and a long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoder. Only joints relevant to each exercise were evaluated, and joint-level results were integrated to compute arm-level abnormality rates. The correlation-based abnormality rate showed a significant negative correlation with FMA scores (r = −0.7789, p = 2.83 × 10−3), while the LSTM autoencoder-based abnormality rate exhibited a stronger correlation(r = −0.8454, p = 5.33 × 10−4). In addition, affected-side classification accuracy reached 78.0% and 83.3% for correlation analysis and the LSTM autoencoder, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed method is consistent with clinical assessments and can serve as a non-invasive, cost-effective tool for video-based rehabilitation evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "This study presents an integrated modeling and optimization framework for laser transmission welding (LTW) of transparent polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) joints using single- and multi-core copper wires as energy absorbers. The highly nonlinear relationships between laser power, welding speed, and spot diameter and the resulting shear force and weld width were modeled using a hybrid neuro-regression strategy combining data-driven learning with physically interpretable analytical formulations. A wide range of candidate mathematical models were systematically evaluated based on training and testing performance, residual behavior, and physical consistency. The results demonstrate that models exhibiting near-perfect training accuracy frequently suffered from severe overfitting and poor generalization, whereas intermediate-complexity formulations provided a more reliable balance between accuracy and robustness. Comparative analysis further showed that multi-core absorbers consistently produced higher shear strength and more uniform weld seams than single-core configurations. The selected robust models were subsequently integrated into a two-level ensemble meta-optimization framework employing Differential Evolution, Nelder–Mead, Random Search, and Simulated Annealing algorithms under multiple design scenarios. The meta-optimization process successfully eliminated model- and algorithm-dependent extreme solutions and identified stable consensus parameter regions. For the multi-core system, an optimal combination of 30 W laser power, 20 mm/s welding speed, and 0.7 mm spot diameter was obtained, achieving improved mechanical performance while remaining within experimentally validated limits. The proposed framework provides a physically grounded and reliable strategy for surrogate-based optimization of nonlinear welding processes.",

    "Abstract": "Maritime nations around the world proactively engage in preparedness, response, and recovery activities related to marine oil spills. In addition to an individual nation’s capabilities, there are a number of response organizations that are actively engaged in the surveillance, monitoring, and remote sensing of spilled oil. A global survey was conducted of these organizations to better understand surveillance/remote sensing capabilities operationally employed today from four aerial platforms: satellites, fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPASs). Satellite remote sensing continues to be used for both routine surveillance of coastal environments and in support of response to oil spills. Additionally, there is a strong continued use of fixed-wing aircraft, and in some cases helicopters, particularly to support operational response to oil spills. Many of these fixed-wing aircraft are outfitted with sensor suites optimized for oil spill detection and documentation. Of particular interest is the recent introduction and widespread use of RPASs for the response of marine oil spills and oiled shorelines. Respondents identified operational gaps in remote sensing capabilities to support oil spill response, including the accurate measurement of oil spill thickness and volume, differentiation between petroleum oil and biogenic materials, and the detection of water-in-oil emulsions. Survey respondents also shared remote sensing capabilities used for oiled shorelines, as well as identifying research and operational gaps in the surveillance of oil spills.",

This study systematically evaluated the robustness and accuracy of settlement prediction models using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. A numerical model incorporating the permeability characteristics of soft foundations was established to simulate stochastic system responses. Furthermore, an innovative multi-metric evaluation framework was constructed using the entropy weight method, integrating goodness-of-fit, prediction accuracy (systematic error), and stability (random error). Four classical empirical models—Hyperbolic, Exponential Curve, Asaoka, and Hoshino—were assessed. The results indicate that: (1) The Hyperbolic Method significantly outperformed other models (p&lt;0.01) in goodness-of-fit (mean correlation coefficient: 0.983 ± 0.006) and accuracy (systematic error: 3.2% ± 1.1%); (2) The Hoshino Method exhibited optimal stability, characterized by the lowest random error (3.8 ± 2.0 mm); and (3) Model performance showed a significant positive correlation with the permeability coefficient (R2&gt;0.92). Validated by five distinct engineering cases, the comprehensive performance ranking was determined as: Hyperbolic &gt; Hoshino &gt; Exponential Curve &gt; Asaoka. These findings provide a scientific strategy for model selection under non-stationary conditions and offer theoretical support for refining railway deformation monitoring standards.",

    "Abstract": "The manufacturing process of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) is highly resource-intensive and significantly contributes to global CO2 emissions, thereby exacerbating global warming. In this context, researchers are progressively adopting geopolymer concrete owing to its environmentally friendly production process. However, cracks in OPC and geopolymer concrete structures can substantially reduce their lifespan by exposing reinforcement to the external environment, resulting in concrete deterioration. To mitigate these issues, the self-healing capability of concrete presents an innovative solution to restore structural integrity and minimise maintenance costs. This research delineates various healing techniques and their efficacy for geopolymer concrete, including crystalline admixture, fibres, bacteria, and enzymes. This study primarily examines geopolymer compositions to assess the self-healing efficiency of different healing agents. As many healing agents, including crystalline admixtures and enzyme-based systems, were originally developed for OPC-based concrete and remain underexplored in geopolymers, parallel investigations on OPC systems are also conducted to enable a comparative understanding of the underlying healing mechanisms. The current state of research indicates that crystalline admixture was unable to facilitate crack healing within the geopolymer matrix unless an additional 10% Ca(OH)2 was incorporated into the binder. The inclusion of fibres embedded with healing agents markedly improved the healing efficiency, achieving a crack width of up to 800 µm when utilised with natural fibres and bacteria. The integration of an optimal quantity of various healing agents enhances the compressive, split tensile, and flexural strength of the concrete. The optimal dosages for the crystalline admixture ranged from 1% to 1.5% by weight of the binder, while the concentration of bacteria ranged from 105 to 107 cells/mL. Furthermore, this review delineates the practical applications and limitations of various healing agents. By integrating appropriate healing agents into geopolymer concrete, this research aims to advance a sustainable approach to durable infrastructure.",

    "Abstract": "Precise tumor segmentation in multimodal MRI is crucial for glioma diagnosis and treatment planning; yet, deep learning models still struggle with irregular boundaries and severe class imbalance under computational constraints. An Enhanced 3D DenseNet with CDC architecture was proposed, integrating Central Difference Convolution, attention gates, and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling for brain tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2023-GLI dataset. CDC layers enhance boundary sensitivity by combining intensity-level semantics and gradient-level features. Attention gates selectively emphasize relevant encoder features during skip connections, whereas the ASPP captures the multi-scale context with dilation rates. A hybrid loss function spanning three levels was introduced, consisting of a region-based Dice loss for volumetric overlap, a GPU-native 3D Sobel boundary loss for edge precision, and a class-weighted focal loss for handling class imbalance. The proposed model achieved a mean Dice score of 91.30% (ET: 87.84%, TC: 92.73%, WT: 93.34%) on the test set. Notably, these results were achieved with approximately 3.7 million parameters, representing a 17–76x reduction compared to the 50–200 million parameters required by transformer-based approaches. Enhanced 3D DenseNet with CDC architecture demonstrates that the integration of gradient-sensitive convolutions, attention mechanisms, multi-scale feature extraction, and multi-level loss optimization achieves competitive segmentation performance with significantly reduced computational requirements.",

    "Abstract": "This study proposes a sustainable urban planning strategy that enhances building energy self-sufficiency through photovoltaic-based renewable energy generation. This research focused on high-rise residential complexes and introduces an adaptive facade system designed to efficiently utilize the extensive solar-exposed surfaces of building facades. The system was programmed to automatically adjust according to the optimal tilt angle, which reflects monthly variations in solar altitude and azimuth, thereby maximizing energy generation. To further improve the effectiveness of the adaptive facade system, a “bridge-type apartment complex” layout was developed, in which building orientations varied around a south-facing axis to include southeast and southwest orientations. The proposed urban configuration was developed using a parametric design within the building information modeling software Revit 2023, and energy generation simulations were conducted for Seoul, South Korea, using Insight (a Revit plug-in) during 2024. Simulation results revealed that bridge-type apartment complexes achieved higher levels of renewable energy generation than conventional slab-type apartment complexes. These findings suggest that a three-dimensional urban design incorporating diverse facade orientations, combined with a dynamic adaptive facade system, not only enhances energy efficiency but also offers the potential to create creative and flexible urban landscapes that contrast with conventional, uniform cityscapes.",

    "Abstract": "The long-term esthetic performance of indirect restorations is closely related to the color stability and surface integrity of the restorative materials used. With the increasing use of CAD/CAM technologies, a wide range of ceramic- and resin-based materials have been developed for indirect restorative applications. These include feldspathic ceramics (VITA Mark II, VITA Zahnfabrik), hybrid ceramics (VITA Enamic, VITA Zahnfabrik), resin nanoceramic CAD/CAM blocks (Lava Ultimate, 3M), and indirect microhybrid resin composites (GC Posterior, GC Corporation). However, these materials are continuously exposed to chemical and mechanical challenges in the oral environment, such as staining from beverages and daily toothbrushing, which may compromise their optical and surface properties over time. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate and compare the color change (ΔE) and surface roughness (Ra) of these materials after repeated coffee immersion and simulated toothbrushing. A total of 240 disk-shaped specimens were fabricated and subjected to three aging cycles consisting of storage in coffee or distilled water, followed by simulated toothbrushing with or without toothpaste. The color parameters were measured using a spectrophotometer according to the CIE Lab* system, surface roughness was assessed using a contact profilometer, and surface topography was qualitatively analyzed by atomic force microscopy. The results demonstrated that coffee immersion significantly increased both color change and surface roughness for all tested materials, with more pronounced effects observed in resin-based materials. Ceramic-based CAD/CAM materials (VITA Mark II and VITA Enamic) showed greater resistance to discoloration and surface degradation, whereas the resin nanoceramic material (Lava Ultimate) and the microhybrid resin composite (GC Posterior) exhibited clinically perceptible color changes and higher roughness values, particularly after toothbrushing with toothpaste.",

    "Abstract": "Ex situ conservation in breading centers is one of the key strategies for saving giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca). Abnormal behaviors (e.g., inappetence) are key symptoms of potential health issues (e.g., Klebsiella pneumoniae) for the captives. Therefore, monitoring their normal activity patterns could set a baseline to detect these abnormalities for implementing timely interventions. However, traditional monitoring methods are labor-intensive, which often rely on manual observations. Here, we proposed a deep learning framework, termed as DeepPanda, for automatically recognizing four essential behaviors (i.e., eating, walking, resting and drinking) of giant pandas based on videos from common surveillance cameras. Experimental results demonstrated that the DeepPanda model achieved high performance on the self-established APanda dataset, with the testing mean average precision at an IoU threshold of 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 98.8%. This methodology provides a powerful tool for monitoring the captive giant panda’s behaviors.",

    "Abstract": "Despite advances in high-resolution topographic survey technologies, abstracting static 3D data into physically meaningful indicators remains critical for river management. This study introduces a geometric moment technique to reflect river curvature and hydraulic characteristics within an integrated framework. Analysis was conducted on a reach of the Nakdong River using first-, second-, and third-order moments, W/D ratios, asymmetry indicators, and D50 data. Key findings are: First, the moment-based approach precisely quantified asymmetric variations and localized bed changes by utilizing centroid deviation (M1), dispersion (M2), and mass bias (M3), addressing the limitations of traditional average-based indices. This effectively transforms vast 3D datasets into “compressed records” for tracing hydraulic drivers. Second, sinuosity (S) analysis revealed that reaches with higher curvature (S ≥ 1.5) exhibited intensified variability in third-order moments and asymmetry due to imbalanced hydraulic forcing. Specifically, the horizontal misalignment between the velocity core and the thalweg was identified as a key mechanism driving geometric imbalance in curves. Third, a W/D-asymmetry quadrant analysis categorized reach-scale morphological types and identified hydraulically vulnerable zones. By integrating sectional geometry, velocity distribution, and sinuosity into a unified system, this study provides a quantitative framework for scientific river management and decision-making.",

    "Abstract": "Regarding the issue of abnormal data mining of electricity meters in the PLC application area, an intelligent measurement network architecture integrating protocol message interaction and an anomaly detection module has been designed. Based on an improved convolutional neural network (ICNN), abnormal messages during the transmission and reception process are monitored to enhance the reliability of power information collection data. Firstly, common anomalies during the meter reading operation are analyzed using protocol analysis tools, including abnormal power data, excessive delay, message out of order, etc. Subsequently, a dataset containing these anomalies with a preset proportion is constructed, and through data splicing and matrix processing, it is transformed into a two-dimensional image set to optimize the recognition effect of the convolutional neural network. Ultimately, an anomaly detection algorithm based on the ICNN is developed. Gray wolf optimization (GWO) is adopted to improve the algorithm’s performance, and the algorithm is integrated into the anomaly detection module. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with the CNN-LSTM and CNN-SVM algorithms, the proposed algorithm offers an advantage in terms of complexity while achieving an accuracy rate of 98.8%, providing a reliable anomaly detection solution for metering network measurement systems.",

    "Abstract": "The research aimed to evaluate the effect of high monounsaturated cold-pressed oil addition on the inhibition of refined rapeseed oil degradation during heating at frying temperature. Cold-pressed rapeseed, coriander seed, and apricot kernel oils were added in amounts of 5 and 25%. Refined rapeseed oil without additives and refined rapeseed oil supplemented with tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) were negative and positive control samples, respectively. Blends were heated in a thin layer at 170 and 200 °C. Considering the increase in total polar compounds (TPCs) and oxidized triacylglycerol monomer (oxTAG) content, natural additives demonstrated protective properties and were more effective than the TBHQ additive, especially at 200 °C. The lowest increases in TPC and oxTAG were found in AO5% at 170 °C (10.17% and 1.40 mg/g oil, respectively) and in AO25% at 200 °C (5.71% and 47.53 mg/g oil, respectively). The presence of triacylglycerol (TAG) dimers was found only in samples heated at 200 °C, and the lowest was in the sample with 25% coriander oil. It can be concluded that the addition of cold-pressed oils limited the TAG oxidation process. The addition of 25% coriander oil was effective in inhibiting the TAG polymerization process, and it may be a powerful alternative to synthetic antioxidants in improving stabilization of frying oils.",

    "Abstract": "The western Kuqa Foreland Basin exhibits complex hydrocarbon distribution with unclear accumulation processes. This study integrated seismic data, microscopic observations, crude oil properties, and basin modelling to establish a dynamic hydrocarbon migration model for the study area. The results indicated two distinct accumulation phases. During the early phase (16–5 Ma), hydrocarbons migrated eastward along a single unconformity and accumulated in the buried-hill reservoir of well E937 in the southern part of the Baicheng hydrocarbon-generating depression. In contrast, the southwestern region failed to accumulate hydrocarbons because of its distance from the Triassic source rock hydrocarbon generation centre and complex migration pathways. During the late phase (5–0 Ma), the Jurassic hydrocarbon generation centre shifted westward, and hydrocarbons migrated through a composite conduit system comprising faults, weathered crust, and sandstone structural ridges. This process promoted the expansion of the eastern E937 well trap, whereas well WEN54 and other southwestern wells exhibited hydrocarbon accumulation potential. The simulation results predicted that hydrocarbon reservoirs in the eastern region were mainly concentrated in the Qiulitage structural belt east of well E938. This study provides a theoretical basis and predictive guidance for hydrocarbon exploration in this area.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional expansion joints in bridge structures are prone to durability problems, such as leakage, corrosion, and high maintenance demands, which can significantly reduce service life. To overcome these limitations, ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) link slabs have emerged as an effective jointless solution; however, their mechanical performance and sensitivity to key design and modeling parameters are not yet fully understood. This study presents a nonlinear finite element investigation of UHPC link slabs using the Concrete Damaged Plasticity (CDP) model in ABAQUS. A baseline model, validated against the experimental results, was established with a link slab length of 1100 mm and representative material and detailing properties. A systematic sensitivity analysis was then performed by varying five geometrical parameters (link slab length and thickness, debonding length, reinforcement diameter, and reinforcement spacing) and five numerical/material parameters (non-debonding and debonding interface friction coefficient, UHPC and normal concrete compressive strength, and steel yield strength). For each case, the load–displacement response was examined through initial stiffness (K0), yield and peak load–deformation values (Py, Δy and Pu, Δu), and ductility ratio (μ). The results highlight the dominant role of reinforcement detailing; larger bar diameters and closer spacing substantially increased stiffness and strength while maintaining ductility. Debonding length emerged as a critical tuning parameter, with longer debonding improving ductility but slightly reducing strength. Slab thickness primarily influenced stiffness, whereas overall length showed minor effects on peak capacity. On the numerical side, steel yield strength proved to be the most influential input, affecting all response measures, while the non-debonding interface friction coefficient strongly governed yield capacity. Variations in the debonding friction coefficient, UHPC compressive strength, and normal concrete strength exhibited secondary influence within the tested ranges. Overall, the findings provide practical guidance for both the designing and detailing of UHPC link slabs and the calibration of FEM (finite element modeling) models. By clarifying which parameters most strongly govern stiffness, strength, and ductility, this study supports more reliable structural design and efficient numerical modeling of UHPC link slabs in accelerated bridge construction applications.",

    "Abstract": "It is now crucial to accurately monitor the state of health (SoH) of batteries in a setting where the use of electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy technologies is still growing. To solve this issue and evaluate the SoH, this paper makes use of deep learning technology. The suggested method incorporates voltage, current, and temperature data, which are important indications of the SoH and can potentially be obtained directly from the battery management system (BMS). Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have previously been employed for SoH estimation, our study distinguishes itself by implementing a robust, completely configurable DNN application in MATLAB/Simulink R2019a. This design enables the adjustment of activation functions, layer depth, and neuron count to adapt to different battery aging conditions. To achieve optimal performance, numerous configurations were examined, highlighting the relevance of hyperparameter setting. Our technique avoids traditional feature engineering while providing a practical, adaptive, and accurate SoH estimate framework appropriate for real-world integration. The precision of the improved model was then verified against a Li-ion battery dataset with various discharge profiles given by the national aeronautics and space administration (NASA). The collected findings revealed that the proposed method is more accurate and robust than other regularly used models. The DNN model achieved a Mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.433% and a Coefficient of determination of 0.99998, outperforming previous methods such as CNN-BiGRU, which reported an MAE of 2.448% in a recent publication.

    "Abstract": "Background: Breast cancer diagnosis increasingly relies on ultrasound imaging, but challenges related to operator dependency and image quality limitations necessitate automated segmentation approaches. Traditional U-Net architectures, while widely used for medical image segmentation, suffer from shallow encoder structures that limit feature extraction capabilities. Methods: This study proposes an enhanced segmentation model that replaces the conventional U-Net encoder with an Inception architecture and employs transfer learning using ImageNet pre-trained weights. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of 900 breast ultrasound images from Kyungpook National University Hospital. Performance evaluation utilized multiple metrics including Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice coefficient, precision, and recall scores. Results: The proposed Inception U-Net achieved superior performance with an IoU score of 0.7774, Dice score of 0.8491, precision score of 0.7081, and recall score of 0.7174, demonstrating approximately 5% improvement over baseline U-Net architecture across all evaluation metrics. Conclusions: The integration of Inception modules within the U-Net architecture effectively addresses feature extraction limitations in breast ultrasound segmentation. Transfer learning from ImageNet datasets proves beneficial even across domain differences, establishing a foundation for broader medical imaging applications.",

    "Abstract": "Wetlands occupy a mere 6% of Earth’s land surface, yet they contribute 25–45% of global natural methane (CH4) emissions. A key contradiction emerges here: it is the soil of these wetlands that serves as the host for methane-trophic microorganisms, which can oxidize the vast majority of the methane they produce under specific conditions (for example, the aerobic interface). A wetland’s role as either a net source or sink for atmospheric CH4 is therefore a primary driver of hydrological variability. This research synthesis current understandings of how wet–dry cycles regulate methanotrophic communities and their CH4 consumption capacity. Shifts in the water table directly modulate methanotroph physiology, community structure, and metabolic activity. These hydrological effects are further amplified or attenuated by nitrogen availability, plant-derived exudates, and edaphic properties. Herein, key knowledge gaps concerning the adaptive responses of methanotrophs to hydrological change are identified, and targeted research priorities improving predictions of wetland CH4 fluxes under contrasting moisture regimes are accordingly outlined. This review synthesizes recent advances to highlight the mechanistic understanding essential for guiding wetland management strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is a particularly lethal gynecological malignancy with few treatment options due to its late-stage diagnosis, extensive genetic heterogeneity, and frequent development of resistance to existing therapies. Immunotherapy has revolutionized the management and clinical outcome of numerous solid tumors, but its clinical benefit for OC has been limited, in part due to an extremely immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and diverse, overlapping immune evasion mechanisms. In this review, we present a comprehensive and timely synthesis of next-generation immunotherapeutic approaches for ovarian cancer, emphasizing strategies that overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve clinical responsiveness. We describe the emerging molecular mechanisms of immune evasion in OC, including altered antigen presentation, inhibition of T-cell activation (e.g., via immunological checkpoints, metabolic reprogramming), polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and dysfunction of natural killer (NK) cells. We also critically examine several emerging therapeutic approaches, including combination immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs), neoantigen-based vaccines, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T- and CAR-NK-cell therapies, oncolytic viruses (OVs), and nanoparticle-mediated immunomodulation. In addition, we highlight recent advances in tumor microenvironment–targeted therapies for ovarian cancer, focusing on strategies that modulate non-lymphoid components such as cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), hypoxia-driven signaling, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis to enhance antitumor immune responsiveness. Finally, we discuss how predictive biomarkers, multi-omics systems, and patient-derived organoid models are accelerating the development and deployment of precision immunotherapies for OC. We would like to highlight the translational promise of next-generation immunotherapies and identify novel molecular targets that may be leveraged to achieve durable responses in OC.",

    "Abstract": "Aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are associated with profound changes in glial cell morphology and signaling. This study investigates the three-dimensional morphology of microglia and the intracellular localization of phosphorylated SMAD proteins as downstream effectors of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease. Using confocal microscopy and Simple Neurite Tracer software, we reconstructed and quantitatively analyzed glial cell morphology in aged wild-type and APP/PS1 mice. Immunofluorescence staining revealed altered pSMAD2 distribution in microglia, suggesting impaired canonical TGF-β signaling. Our findings indicate a disturbed glial morphology and dysfunctional TGF-β signaling cascade in the APP/PS1 model, underlining their potential role in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer immunoprevention leverages the immune system’s surveillance mechanisms to mitigate tumor development. Vaccines that constitute a tumor antigen and an immune adjuvant are perceived as immunoprevention modalities. However, relevant tumor antigens are unknown for non-viral cancers, which constitute most human cancers. Our group has recently shown that SA–4–1BBL, a novel agonist of CD137 receptor, but not antibodies, shows immunoprevention efficacy against various tumors. Advanced bioinformatics analyses of bulk RNA-seq data were conducted to elucidate mechanisms underlying cancer immunoprevention. Mice received subcutaneous injections of SA–4–1BBL or agonistic 3H3 antibody, and the injection-site tissue (IS) and draining lymph nodes (LN) were analyzed for differential gene expression. SA–4–1BBL induced a compartmentalized and temporally dynamic immune program characterized by early effector activation at IS and sustained immune regulation in draining LN. K-means clustering of 4564 DEGs identified eight functionally distinct clusters. IS-enriched clusters contained activation genes for CD4+ T and NK cells, including Cd28, Klra1, Cd4, Cd40, and Cd40l, while LN clusters were enriched for regulatory genes (Tnfaip3, Irf5, Col1a2) that ensure immune priming and homeostatic restraint for a balanced response. SA–4–1BBL generated a more selective and durable activation of adaptive immunity, TCR signaling, Th1/Th2 differentiation, and NK cytotoxicity. 3H3 activated broader innate inflammatory programs, including Toll-like receptor and neurodegeneration-linked pathways. IMPRes analysis showed that SA–4–1BBL activates sequential immune-regulatory circuits centered on Stat1, Cd247, and Ifng and modulates the CD151–TGF-β axis. These findings demonstrate that SA–4–1BBL elicits a balanced immune response, ensuring both safety and efficacy in preventing cancer development.",

    "Abstract": "Endurance running exposure alone may not be sufficient to slow the age-related decline in plantarflexor function, which is also thought to contribute to the decline in running economy. Strength training has been shown to improve running performance, but specific programs have not been evaluated for their assistance in maintaining plantarflexor function and “youthful” metabolic costs in aging runners. The purpose of this study was to assess the relative influence of three types of resistance training interventions on running economy (RE), plantarflexor function, and Achilles tendon (AT) stiffness in middle-aged runners. Methods: Twenty-six middle-aged runners (51 ± 5 yrs) participated in one of three 10-week resistance training interventions: (1) heavy resistance training, (2) heavy resistance training + plyometrics, and (3) endurance resistance training + plyometrics. Laboratory testing for RE, biomechanical variables, peak plantarflexor torque, and AT stiffness during isometric contractions occurred before and after the interventions. A mixed-design repeated measures ANOVA was used to address our research question, while paired and independent t-tests were used to compare time and group effects, respectively. Results: Relative (to V˙O2max) RE (−2.4%, p = 0.016), AT stiffness (+26.1%, p = 0.002), and peak isometric plantarflexor torque (+26.4%, p = 0.001) improved with resistance training, with no interaction or group effects. No significant interaction, time, or group effects were observed for V˙O2max and peak plantarflexor torque, peak positive ankle power, or positive and negative ankle work while running. Conclusions: We present novel but exploratory findings that resistance training, regardless of modality, may moderately improve RE and Achilles tendon stiffness in middle-aged recreational runners. However, sagittal plane lower joint kinematics, extensor torques, powers, and work were unaffected by resistance training in middle-aged runners.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: In Rhythmic Gymnastics (RG), the jump is an element of great difficulty that requires the qualities of strength and coordination. Jump height and power are the variables normally used to assess the final performance of jumps. However, they do not allow us to analyze what happens in the intermediate stages or provide practical information to find jump improvement strategies. This study aimed to determine which kinetic variables, organized within a hierarchical model, serve as performance indicators in the Pike Jump executed from a standing start with arm swing. Methods: Ten high-level women gymnasts (14 ± 0.7 years) performed 53 Pike Jumps on a Dinascan-IBV, v.8.1 dynamometric platform (Valencia, Spain) that recorded at 1000 Hz. In the model, jumping was divided into five phases, and 76 related efficacy variables were defined, with 34 of them normalized for total jump time or body weight. Bivariate correlations were analyzed with a bilateral significance test to validate the proposed model. Results: Average and Initial Vertical Ground Reaction Force can be used as performance indicators of the Pike Jump, providing information on intermediate stages of the jump and allowing us to improve specific aspects related to the level of force and the way to apply it in RG. Conclusions: The degree of correlation found among the variables allowed us to validate the model. Normalized variables allow a more precise analysis to be carried out and question some results obtained in the literature in which non-normalized data were presented.",

    "Abstract": "Glutamine metabolism has emerged as one of the most critical bioenergetic and biosynthetic programs sustaining leukemic cell growth, survival, stemness and therapeutic resistance. In both acute and chronic leukemias, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), malignant cells display a strong dependency on extracellular glutamine to support mitochondrial respiration, anabolic biosynthesis and redox homeostasis. This dependency is reinforced by oncogenic signaling networks, post-transcriptional metabolic regulation and microenvironmental adaptation within the bone marrow niche. Therapeutic strategies targeting glutamine utilization, including glutaminase inhibition, transporter blockade and enzymatic glutamine depletion, have demonstrated robust antileukemic activity in preclinical models, and early clinical efforts have begun to explore glutamine-directed interventions in myeloid neoplasms. However, metabolic plasticity, microenvironment-derived nutrient buffering and systemic toxicity remain significant limitations to clinical translation. This review provides a detailed synthesis of the biochemical framework of glutamine metabolism in leukemia, the molecular mechanisms enforcing glutamine addiction, the downstream functional consequences on proliferation, redox balance and leukemic stem cell biology, the current landscape of therapeutic strategies and emerging directions aimed at overcoming resistance and improving clinical efficacy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Depression is a common mental disorder, and early and objective diagnosis of depression is challenging. New advances in deep learning show promise for processing audio and video content when screening for depression. Nevertheless, the majority of current methods rely on raw video processing or multimodal pipelines, which are computationally costly and challenging to understand and create privacy issues, restricting their use in actual clinical settings. Methods: Based solely on spatiotemporal 3D face landmark representations, we describe a unique, totally visual, and lightweight deep learning approach to overcome these constraints. In this paper we introduce, for the first time, a pure visual deep learning framework, based on spatiotemporal 3D facial landmarks extracted from clinical interview videos contained in the DAIC-WOZ and Extended DAIC-WOZ (E-DAIC) datasets. Our method does not use raw video or any type of semi-automated multimodal fusion. Whereas raw video streaming can be computationally expensive and is not well suited to investigating specific variables, we first take a temporal series of 3D landmarks, convert them to pseudo-images (224 × 224 × 3), and then use them within a CNN-LSTM framework. Importantly, CNN-LSTM provides the ability to analyze the spatial configuration and temporal dimensions of facial behavior. Results: The experimental results indicate macro-average F1 scores of 0.74 on DAIC-WOZ and 0.762 on E-DAIC, demonstrating robust performance under heavy class imbalances, with a variability of ±0.03 across folds. Conclusion: These results indicate that landmark-based spatiotemporal modeling represents the future of lightweight, interpretable, and scalable automatic depression detection. Second, our results suggest exciting opportunities for completely embedding ADI systems within the framework of real-world MHA.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Software is now core infrastructure in biomedical science, yet fragmented workflows across subfields hinder reproducibility and delay the translation of data into actionable decisions. There is a critical need for a cross-disciplinary synthesis to bridge these silos and establish a unified framework for software maturity. This narrative review addresses this gap by synthesizing representative software ecosystems across three major pillars: bioinformatics, molecular modeling/simulations, and epidemiology/public health. Methods: A narrative review of articles indexed in PubMed/NCBI, Web of Science, and Scopus between 2000 and 2025 was conducted. Domain-specific terms related to bioinformatics, molecular modeling, docking, molecular dynamics, epidemiology, public health, and workflow management were combined with software- and algorithm-focused keywords. Studies describing, validating, or applying documented tools with biomedical relevance were included. Results: Across domains, mature data standards and reference resources (e.g., FASTQ, BAM/CRAM, VCF, mzML), widely adopted platforms (e.g., BLAST+ (v2.16.0, NCBI, Bethesda, USA), Bioconductor (v3.20, Bioconductor Foundation, Seattle, USA), AutoDock Vina (v1.2.5, Scripps Research, La Jolla, USA), GROMACS (v2024.3, GROMACS Team, Stockholm, Sweden), Epi Info (v7.2.6, CDC, Atlanta, USA), QGIS (v3.40, QGIS.org, Gossau, Switzerland), and increasing use of workflow engines were identified. Software pipelines routinely transform molecular and surveillance data into interpretable features supporting hypothesis generation. Conclusions: Integrated, standards-based, and validated software pipelines can shorten the path from measurement to decision in biomedicine and public health. Future progress depends on reproducibility practices, benchmarking, user-centered design, portable implementations, and responsible deployment of machine learning.",

    "Abstract": "Continuum robots (CRs) exhibit high compliance and environmental adaptability in confined, tortuous spaces, yet their inherent low stiffness and load capacity limit performance in precise positioning and stable support tasks. To solve the “soft-rigid” paradox, this study proposes and implements a three-segment tendon-driven variable-stiffness CR. Structurally, a segmented constant-curvature model directs the optimization of grid skeletons and notch parameters, enhancing bending consistency and motion predictability. Elongated flat airbag actuators, arranged in annular arrays, enable segment-level stiffness switching through the enhancement of surface properties like axial constraints and friction amplification. A time-sharing drive strategy decouples multi-segment coupling into sequential single-segment subproblems, reducing drivers and kinematic complexity while maintaining dexterity. Experimental results demonstrate that flexible-mode joints maintain near-constant curvature with stable motion (average end-effector trajectory error &lt; 0.9 mm), and in rigid mode, stiffness increases by a factor of 5.77 (rated load: 4.0 N). Shape-locking disturbances during transitions are confined to millimeter levels (remote offset &lt; 1.32 mm), with successful traversal of J/U/S-shaped and irregular paths confirmed in pipeline tests. This work introduces a practical, scalable system for designing variable-stiffness structures and enabling low-complexity multi-segment control, offering valuable insights for minimally invasive devices and industrial endoscopy in confined spaces.",

    "Abstract": "With the advancement of task-oriented reinforcement learning (RL), the capability of quadruped robots for motion generation and complex task completion has significantly improved. However, current control strategies require extensive domain expertise and time-consuming design processes to acquire operational skills and achieve multi-task motion control, often failing to effectively manage complex behaviors composed of multiple coordinated actions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a motion policy generation method for quadruped robots based on multimodal motion primitives and imitation learning. A multimodal motion library was constructed using 3D engine motion design, motion capture data retargeting, and trajectory planning. A temporal domain-based behavior planner was designed to combine these primitives and generate complex behaviors. We developed a RL-based imitation learning training framework to achieve precise trajectory tracking and rapid policy deployment, ensuring the effective application of actions/behaviors on the quadruped platform. Simulation and physical experiments conducted on the Lite3 quadruped robot validated the efficacy of the proposed approach, offering a new paradigm for the deployment and development of motion strategies for quadruped robots.",

    "Abstract": "Peri-implantitis is an inflammatory disease caused by bacterial colonization that leads to progressive bone loss around dental implants. Implantoplasty is widely used for biofilm removal; however, it alters the titanium surface, generating particle release and impairing surface properties. This study evaluated whether a citric acid-based solution supplemented with collagen and magnesium cations could enhance hard and soft tissue regeneration following implantoplasty. Three surfaces were analyzed: physiological saline (Ctr), 25% citric acid (AC), and citric acid with collagen and magnesium nitrate hexahydrate (AC500/Mg). Surface roughness and wettability were assessed on titanium discs. Cytocompatibility, cell adhesion, and proliferation were evaluated using fibroblasts and osteoblasts up to 21 days, and mineralization was analyzed by alkaline phosphatase. In vivo studies were conducted in New Zealand rabbits with implants placed in the femur and muscle tissue. Surface roughness did not differ among treatments, while wettability significantly increased with citric acid-based solutions. All treatments showed good cytocompatibility. AC500/Mg significantly enhanced cell adhesion, proliferation, and osteoblast mineralization, showing threefold higher activity than controls at 21 days. In vivo, AC500/Mg exhibited greater bone contact (67%) and direct muscle integration, whereas AC and Ctr showed lower bone contact and fibrotic encapsulation. These results indicate that AC500/Mg improves soft and hard tissue responses without altering roughness, suggesting its potential as a regenerative strategy following implantoplasty.",

    "Abstract": "In on-site rapid detection, the electrochemical method boasts high sensitivity and rapid response capabilities, while the colorimetric method can provide intuitive visual readings suitable for on-site screening. Therefore, this study developed an innovative dual-mode electrochemical/colorimetric aptasensor for the accurate detection of malathion (MAL) in vegetables. The sensor combines magnetic Fe3O4@ZIF-8-DNA composites and CuZr-MOF-cDNA probes, enabling simultaneous detection of the target through electrochemical reactions and colorimetric changes. The introduction of CuZr-MOF not only enhances the sensor’s conductivity but also significantly amplifies the electrochemical signal through its catalytic properties. The magnetic Fe3O4@ZIF-8-DNA composite facilitates solid–liquid separation under an external magnetic field. When the target MAL is present, the aptamer binds to the target, causing the CuZr-MOF-cDNA probes to release from the composite, altering the number of free probes in the supernatant and generating varying intensities of colorimetric signals. Meanwhile, the MAL captured in the precipitate by the aptamer is quantitatively detected through electrochemical methods. Experimental results demonstrate that as the target concentration increases, the colorimetric signal intensifies while the electrochemical signal weakens, showing a good linear relationship between the two. The aptasensor’s limit of detection (LOD) for colorimetric and electrochemical modes was 1.57 × 10−11 M and 4.76 × 10−11 M, respectively, with recoveries ranging from 87.71% to 107.68% and relative standard deviations between 3.23% and 10.75%. This method exhibits high sensitivity, excellent selectivity, and strong reliability, providing a novel technique for the accurate quantification of MAL in vegetables, particularly suited for on-site rapid detection.",

This paper reports a mixed-methods evaluation of BE At King’s, a seed-funded programme supporting grassroots, co-created initiatives to strengthen connection and inclusion across a large, multi-campus institution. Five projects—ranging from art clubs and community breakfasts to hackathons and writing retreats—were designed and delivered by students and staff, with evaluation embedded from the outset. Quantitative survey data (n = 202) showed high levels of belonging overall, with structured, interactive initiatives most strongly associated with meeting new people and feeling connected. Qualitative thematic analysis highlighted four themes—Refreshing Routines, Inclusive Conditions, Community Leadership, and Layered Engagement—revealing how belonging was fostered through predictable routines, psychologically safe spaces, and opportunities for shared ownership. Bringing findings together shows that grassroots initiatives can engage even less-connected students, but that careful design, inclusive outreach, and sustained facilitation are critical to their success. We argue that universities should embed belonging within the everyday fabric of institutional life through co-produced, flexible, and locally responsive approaches that combine institutional commitment with community leadership.",

    "Abstract": "Sexual harassment (SH) remains widespread in workplaces and academic settings. Traditional compliance-based training has shown limited success in preventing SH or motivating bystander intervention. This study developed and tested a brief online empathy training module that can be completed in under 30 min that aims to help participants better understand and support people who experience SH and increase their willingness to intervene. Two experiments were conducted with U.S. adults recruited from the CloudResearch Connect platform (Study 1: 122 men and 140 women; Study 2: 132 men, 112 women, 4, other gender) who were randomly assigned to complete the SH empathy module, another empathy training module (burglary empathy training), time management training, a standard SH training module, or a waitlist control condition. Measures assessed empathy, perspective taking, and bystander intervention intentions. In Study 1, empathy correlated with bystander intentions, but there were no significant group differences; women reported higher empathy and bystander intentions than men. In Study 2, participants who received SH empathy training demonstrated higher empathy and perspective taking than those in other groups, and empathy improvements were associated with greater willingness to intervene. Gender did not moderate these effects. Overall, findings suggest that integrating a short empathy module into SH prevention programs can enhance readiness to act as supportive bystanders. Future research should assess the longevity of these effects and whether they translate into real-world behavioral change.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Falls and depression in later life are both public health concerns. The current study aimed to establish the longitudinal link between falls and depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults in China. Moreover, the potential mediating role of social adaptation and moderating role of hukou (i.e., household registration system) were explored. Methods: Data were from four consecutive waves of a nationwide, longitudinal survey of community-dwelling older adults in China, encompassing a total of 31,526 person-year observations from 11,092 individual older adults. Both falls and depressive symptoms were self-reported. Random effects regression models were used to estimate the longitudinal association between falls and depressive symptoms. Mediation analysis and moderation were further employed to investigate the mediating role of social adaptation and moderating role of hukou, respectively. Results: We observed a positive longitudinal association between falls and depressive symptoms (β = 0.625 p &lt; 0.001). Social adaptation played a partial mediating role, accounting for 8.91% (95% CI [0.037, 0.075]) of the association. Compared with their rural counterparts, urban older adults experienced significantly higher effects of falls on depression (β = 0.320, p &lt; 0.01). Conclusions: These findings underscore the benefits of fall prevention interventions for elderly depression and advance our understanding of the psychosocial pathways linking falls to psychological outcomes in older adults.",

    "Abstract": "Digital transformation in construction enterprises is frequently constrained by risks that are heterogeneous, context-dependent, and described with inconsistent terminology across studies and practice. Prior research has predominantly relied on expert judgment or narrative reviews to summarize such risks, which limits reproducibility and makes it difficult to iteratively expand the indicator set when new evidence becomes available. To address these challenges, this study develops a hybrid risk identification framework that integrates unsupervised topic modeling with structured inductive coding. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is employed to extract latent semantic patterns from a systematically screened body of literature on construction digital transformation, consolidating dispersed risk expressions into coherent thematic units. The Gioia methodology is then applied to inductively structure these themes into a hierarchical risk indicator system, ensuring traceability from textual evidence to conceptual indicators and enhancing interpretability for construction management applications. Rather than enumerating isolated risk events, the proposed framework conceptualizes digital transformation risk in construction enterprises as a set of interacting structural conditions that shape risk exposure across project stages and organizational boundaries. By shifting risk identification from event-based listings to a structural and condition-oriented representation, this study provides a transferable foundation for subsequent causal modeling and multi-criteria risk evaluation in construction digital transformation.",

    "Abstract": "This study selected a simplified water intake tower model, simplifying the physical structure into a cantilever model, and MATLAB software (R2010b) was used to develop a rapid seismic response analysis program for the structure. Thirty near-fault pulse and non-pulse ground motions were selected as the input ground motions for this analysis. Peak ground velocity (PGV) was used as the intensity parameter for the ground motions. The acceleration, cross-sectional rotation, and lateral curvature of the simplified water intake tower model were calculated for ground motions modulated with different PGA amplitudes. The acceleration, maximum shear force, and cross-sectional rotation of the simplified water intake tower model were also calculated for ground motions modulated with improved effective peak acceleration (IEPA) and improved effective peak velocity (IEPV). The study showed that the seismic response of the simplified water intake tower model for near-fault ground motions modulated with different intensities of PGV amplitude modulation was closer to the unmodulated response order. PGV as an intensity parameter did not affect the acceleration response amplification factor of the water intake tower and hoist chamber. The AC coefficient indicated that PGV was less suitable for pulse-type earthquake amplitude modulation than PGA. Compared with PGA amplitude modulation, IEPA amplitude modulation is more suitable for pulse-type seismic motion, while IEPV amplitude modulation has less impact on pulse-type seismic motion.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: To develop a prediction model able to accurately predict which patients will harbor higher risk prostate cancer in the systematic biopsy template compared to the targeted biopsy during MRI/US fusion biopsy. Methods: We included patients who underwent fusion biopsy. Clinical and radiographic variables were collected from patients' records. The outcome of the model was higher risk prostate cancer in the systematic compared with targeted biopsies. An extreme gradient boosting model was trained and tested. We evaluated variable importance and clinical benefit. Results: Five hundred and twenty-nine patients were included. Eighty-two (15.5%) patients had higher risk prostate cancer in the systematic biopsies. The area under the ROC curve and negative predictive value were 0.82 and 0.92, respectively. The four most important features for outcome prediction were prostate volume, PSAD, patient’s age, and PSA. The decision curve showed increased clinical benefit of our model at threshold probabilities of 0–0.5. Limitations include the retrospective design of the study and the lack of external validation of the model. Conclusions: We developed a prediction model able to accurately predict which patients must undergo systematic and targeted biopsy. This prediction model has the potential to help in the decision whether to perform SB and thus may lower the adverse event rate while keeping a high detection rate.",

    "Abstract": "Iron (oxyhydr)oxides serve as foundational catalysts in heterogeneous Fenton systems, yet their catalytic efficacy varies significantly across distinct mineral species. This review systematically explores the structure-activity relationships governing these variations to provide a clearer understanding of the underlying catalytic mechanisms. The intrinsic physicochemical properties of various mineral phases are examined to elucidate how structural features influence the formation of reactive species, including the highly reactive hydroxyl radical, substrate-dependent high-valent Fe(IV)-oxo species, and selective singlet oxygen generated from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition. Furthermore, recent optimization strategies aimed at overcoming kinetic barriers and enhancing reaction selectivity are summarized. The discussion concludes with an outlook on future research directions, including catalyst evolution under reaction conditions and the characterization of reactive intermediates, while providing a theoretical framework for the rational design of iron-based catalysts with enhanced stability and oxidative performance.",

    "Abstract": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has emerged as a pivotal regulator of post-transcriptional gene control, yet its contribution to chemotherapy resistance remains insufficiently defined. Here, we describe a previously unrecognized METTL3-ADAM23 epitranscriptomic regulatory relationship associated with platinum (Pt) resistance in ovarian cancer (OC). We show that cisplatin treatment increases global m6A levels and METTL3 expression, linking Pt exposure to activation of the m6A machinery. Functional perturbation studies demonstrate that METTL3 overexpression enhances cisplatin resistance, whereas METTL3 knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition with the selective METTL3 inhibitor STM2457 sensitizes OC cells to Pt treatment in vitro and improves Pt response in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling identifies ADAM23, a cell-adhesion-related tumor suppressor, as a METTL3-dependent, m6A-associated transcript, with altered mRNA expression observed across multiple experimental systems and several high-confidence predicted m6A sites within its transcript. Cisplatin-associated METTL3 upregulation correlates with reduced ADAM23 expression, suggesting a potential regulatory relationship that may contribute to chemoresistance. Together, these findings support a model in which METTL3-associated increases in m6A methylation are linked to Pt resistance, in part through modulation of ADAM23 expression, and highlight METTL3 as a potential therapeutic target in OC.",

    "Abstract": "Pesticides are applied to promote performances in the agricultural field, sustaining crop productivity by counteracting the damages induced by pests and weeds. Under conditions of uncontrolled application, their negative influences exerted on soil, water and biodiversity mean contamination of food and impact on human health. The reactive oxygen species generation induced by pesticides impair the antioxidant protective ability. For humans, pesticides can have cytotoxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic potential. They can be classified relying on the chemical structure or on the targeted organism. Optical sensors are based on UV-Vis absorption, fluorescence, chemiluminescence, surface plasmon resonance or Raman scattering. Based on their coloring features, nanomaterials are used in optical sensing platforms. They impart high specific surface area, small sizes, facility of surface modification by biorecognition elements (enzyme, antibody, aptamer, molecularly-imprinted polymer) and promote sensitivity and selectivity in biosensing platforms. The present paper highlights the performances of the optical sensing platforms in pesticide assay. Relevant novel applications are discussed critically, following the attempts to improve analytical features of chemical and biochemical sensors. Critical comparison of the techniques is performed in the last section. Advances in nanofabrication like the inclusion of novel nanomaterials and optimizing data interpretation by integration of algorithms can further enhance performances.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Preterm birth is a significant risk factor for neurodevelopmental delays, but the appropriate use and timing of age correction for developmental assessment remain debated. Objective: This study investigated psychomotor development in preterm children at two years of age, with the aim of clarifying whether age correction remains necessary at this stage, particularly across different gestational age groups. Methods: A total of 161 preterm infants were assessed at a mean chronological age of 25.4 months (mean corrected age: 23.3 months) and compared with two control groups of typically developing children matched for gender and either corrected age (Control–Corr, N = 88) or chronological age (Control–Chron, N = 87). The preterm group was further stratified by gestational age: extremely preterm (&lt;28 weeks), very preterm (28–31 weeks), and moderate-to-late preterm (32–36 weeks). Cognitive, Language (Receptive, Expressive), and Motor (fine, gross) scales of Bayley-III were analysed using t-tests and MANOVAs. Results: Using corrected age, preterm children showed a selective profile, with deficits in Receptive Language, borderline mean score in Gross Motor, and preserved performance in Cognitive, Expressive Communication, and Fine Motor. When compared with controls of the same age, significant differences emerged in the Cognitive, Language, and Gross Motor, but not Fine Motor, domains. In contrast, scoring by chronological age produced a generalised delay, with preterm children performing significantly worse than chronological-age controls across all domains. Subgroup analyses further showed that extremely preterm children already displayed marked Language vulnerabilities at corrected age, which became more severe with chronological scoring and extended to other domains. Very preterm children also fell into the deficit range in Cognitive, Language, and Gross Motor scales/subscales when chronological age was applied, whereas moderate-to-late preterm children performed comparatively better. Conclusions: Developmental assessment using corrected age remains essential at least until 24 months, especially for extremely and very preterm children, to avoid substantial overestimation of developmental difficulties. Chronological scoring, while helpful to highlight persistent vulnerabilities, may inflate delay classification if used too early. Tailoring correction strategies by gestational age and developmental domain could provide a more accurate and clinically meaningful representation of preterm children’s developmental trajectories.",

    "Abstract": "Weather modification has gained significant and growing interest in the United States (US) in recent years. The trend can be largely attributed to the changing climate, persistent droughts, and other extreme weather events that have been experienced across various regions of the US. This paper provides a critical review of weather modification program costs, benefits, policy, and governance to help shed light on policymaking and program management associated with the growing interest in adopting weather modification as a local climate management strategy in the US. Additionally, to deepen our understanding of the widely concerning issues, such as the financial burden on taxpayers and potential environmental risks, the paper explored the local implementation challenges and common environmental and public health concerns related to weather modification activities. A synthesis of the literature and policy debates reached four general conclusions: (1) The need for weather modification programs is expected to keep growing, though regional variations may exist due to regulatory and other local factors; (2) weather modification can bring significant local benefits, ranging from enhanced agricultural yield and recreational economy to extreme weather management and public environmental health benefits; (3) state-level and local support, including financial resources, will be essential for program development in the foreseeable future; and (4) technological advancements will be critical for addressing many of the project operation efficiency challenges and environmental and public health concerns related to weather modification programs. More specifically for program governance and local implementation, aspects such as project planning (including resource pooling), risk and liability management, communication and reporting, outcome measurability, and stakeholder engagement are indispensable for addressing issues related to program legality and oversight, public acceptance, and sustainability.",

    "Abstract": "cBN-reinforced particle Ti-based composite coatings were deposited by high-speed laser cladding technology to enhance the wear resistance of Ti alloy. In this work, the influence of Ag addition on the microstructure and tribological behavior was systematically investigated. The microstructure and phase composition of the coatings were characterized using SEM/EDS and XRD. And the microhardness and tribological performance of coatings with Ag addition were assessed from room temperature up to 500 °C. The results show that the solidification process evolves with different Ag content. At lower Ag concentrations, Ag dissolves in the Ti-based solid solution, whereas higher Ag concentrations lead to the precipitation of Ag and Ag-Ti intermetallic. Due to the solid-solution strengthening effect and the formation of high-hardness intermetallic phases, the hardness of the coating increases with increasing Ag content. However, excessive Ag addition (&gt;2.5 wt.%) results in a decrease in hardness. Tribological tests reveal that the friction coefficient and wear volume at room temperature decrease with increasing Ag content. With 10 wt.% Ag added, the friction coefficient of the coating decreases by 15% to 0.56, and the wear volume reduces by 28%, with the wear mechanism evolving from adhesive and fatigue wear to oxidative wear. At elevated temperatures (300 °C–500 °C), the friction-reducing effect is further enhanced due to the “sweating” of Ag and the formation of an oxide film, leading to reductions in the friction coefficient of 18%, 13%, and 7% at 300 °C, 400 °C, and 500 °C, respectively, for coatings with 5 wt.% Ag compared to coatings without Ag. Moreover, the formation of hard phases improves the coating’s high-temperature softening resistance and wear resistance property, as evidenced by an 85% reduction in wear volume at 500 °C for coatings containing 5 wt.% Ag.",

    "Abstract": "This paper provides a systematic review of urushiol-based antibacterial coatings for lacquer art applications, focusing on three key dimensions: molecular mechanisms, durability, and safety. Natural lacquer films form a dense three-dimensional network through laccase-catalyzed oxidative cross-linking, endowing them with excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, while the catechol structure in urushiol confers broad-spectrum antibacterial potential. The article elaborates on the synergistic antibacterial mechanisms of urushiol, including covalent reactions with bacterial proteins via quinone intermediates, induction of oxidative stress, and metal ion chelation. It also reveals the dynamic change pattern of coating antibacterial activity over time, characterized by “high initial efficiency- gradual mid-term decline—long-term stabilization,” a process influenced collectively by side-chain unsaturation, degree of curing, and environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light exposure. From an application perspective, this review examines modification approaches such as silver/titanium dioxide composite systems, structurally regulated sustained-release strategies, and anti-adhesion surface designs, while pointing out current limitations in artistic compatibility, long-term durability, and safety assessment. Particularly in scenarios involving food contact and cultural heritage preservation, migration risks from unreacted urushiol monomers and metal nanoparticles, as well as the inherent sensitization potential of urushiol, remain critical challenges for safe application. Accordingly, this paper proposes the establishment of a holistic research framework covering “material design–process control–performance evaluation” and advocates for the development of functional coating systems with low migration, high biocompatibility, and preserved aesthetic value. Such advances are essential to promote the sustainable development and safe application of urushiol-based antibacterial coatings in fields such as cultural heritage conservation, daily-use utensils, and high-end decorative arts.",

    "Abstract": "The rise of SIM cloning, identity spoofing, and covert manipulation in mobile and IoT networks has created an urgent need for continuous post-registration verification. This work introduces an unsupervised deep learning framework for detecting behavioral anomalies in SIM-tagged network flows by modeling the intrinsic structure of benign behavioral descriptors (TTL, timing drift, payload statistics). A Temporal Deep Autoencoder (TDAE) combining Conv1D layers and an LSTM encoder is trained exclusively on normal traffic and used to identify deviations through reconstruction error, enabling one-class (label-free) training. For deployment, alarms are set using an unsupervised quantile threshold τα calibrated on benign traffic with a false-alarm budget; τ* is reported only as a diagnostic reference for model comparison. To ensure realism, a large-scale corpus of 3.6 million SIM-tagged flows was constructed by enriching public IoT traffic with pseudo-operator identifiers (synthetic SIM tags derived from device identifiers) and controlled anomaly injections. Cross-domain experiment transfer under SIM-grouped protocol: Training on clean Cassavia-like traffic and testing on attack-rich Guarascio-like flows yields a PR-AUC of 0.93 for the proposed Conv-LSTM Temporal Deep Autoencoder, outperforming Dense Autoencoder, Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, and LOF baselines. Conversely, the reverse direction collapses to PR-AUC ≈0.5, confirming the absence of data leakage and the validity of one-class behavioral learning. Sensitivity analysis shows that performance is stable around the unsupervised quantile operating point. Overall, the proposed framework provides a lightweight, interpretable, and data-efficient behavioral verification layer for detecting cloned or unauthorized SIM activity, complementing existing registration mechanisms in next-generation telecom and IoT ecosystems.",

    "Abstract": "The cultivation of Physalis peruviana has emerged as a promising alternative for small- and medium-sized producers due to its high added value and low production cost. However, information on the cultivation of this vegetable crop under Brazilian edaphoclimatic conditions is still scarce. Seedling production is one of the most critical stages for crop development, as this species does not establish well from seeds under field conditions. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate seed germination and seedling growth of P. peruviana under different container volumes and substrate compositions. The experiment was carried out from February to March 2020 in a screened greenhouse environment, using a completely randomized factorial design. The treatments consisted of different container volumes and substrate compositions, including commercial containers of varying sizes and soil-based substrates formulated with mineral components and organic manures. Four replications were used, each consisting of seven plants. Seed emergence was favored by substrates containing well-composted cattle manure, whereas smaller container volumes reduced the emergence of P. peruviana. The greatest seedling growth, including higher stem base diameter, number of leaves per plant, leaf area, and shoot and root dry mass, was obtained in larger-volume containers filled with soil-based substrates enriched with well-composted cattle manure. Therefore, for the production of high-quality P. peruviana seedlings, the use of 400 cm3 polyethylene containers filled with a mixture of soil, sand, commercial substrate, and well-composted cattle manure in a 1:1:1:2 ratio is recommended.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs) are a core manifestation of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), yet their true prevalence, biological behavior, and optimal management remain debated. Earlier reports suggested increased aggressiveness compared with sporadic PitNETs, while more recent surveillance-based studies indicate a predominantly indolent phenotype. Methods: We conducted a retrospective single-center study including all patients with clinical, familial, or genetic MEN1 referred to the Endocrinology Unit of the University of Naples “Federico II”, ENETS Center of Excellence, between January 2004 and June 2025. Demographic, clinical, radiological, hormonal, and therapeutic data were systematically collected. PitNETs were classified by size and hormonal activity. Results: Among 103 MEN1 patients (61 women), 50 (48.5%) were diagnosed with PitNETs at a mean age of 35.1 years. Microadenomas predominated (60%), and tumors were equally distributed between functioning and non-functioning lesions. Prolactin-secreting PitNETs were the most common functioning subtype (42%), followed by rare GH-, ACTH-, or mixed-secreting PitNETs. Dopamine agonists, mainly cabergoline, were prescribed in 38% of cases, while neurosurgical intervention was required in 14%, exclusively for macroadenomas. During follow-up, recurrence occurred in 8% of patients. No significant sex-related differences were observed in prevalence, tumor size, functional status, treatment approach, or outcomes. Conclusions: In our MEN1 cohort, PitNETs were frequent but largely indolent, with a predominance of microadenomas and limited need for surgery. Our findings support individualized, subtype-driven surveillance strategies, with conservative management for clinically non-functioning microadenomas and closer monitoring of prolactin-secreting PitNETs due to variable medical responsiveness.",

While chronological age is often used as a criterion for surgical eligibility, it remains unclear whether age alone is an independent predictor of surgical and oncological outcomes. This study evaluated whether age is a significant determinant of outcomes in colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgical resection. This retrospective comparative study analyzed 262 patients (193 younger than 70 years, 69 aged ≥ 70 years) diagnosed with colorectal cancer stages I–IV between 2014 and 2021 at a tertiary single center. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan–Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression. Elderly patients had higher ASA classification (p = 0.0270), higher hypertension prevalence (p &lt; 0.0001), higher ICU admission rates (50.7% vs. 21.2%, p &lt; 0.0001), and longer hospital stays (12.6 vs. 7.5 days, p = 0.0016). However, elderly patients presented with earlier-stage disease (Stage I + II: 64.2% vs. 46.1%, p = 0.0108). After adjustment for confounding factors, age did not significantly impact overall survival (HR = 1.33; 95%CI: 0.54–3.26; p = 0.5375) or disease-free survival (HR = 1.61; 95%CI: 0.79–3.29; p = 0.1939). Despite differences in clinical presentation and pathological findings, age itself was not an independent predictor of survival outcomes. These findings suggest that treatment decisions in elderly colorectal cancer patients should be informed by individual patient physiology and disease stage rather than chronological age alone.",

    "Abstract": "Recent evolutionary genetics and molecular characterisation of Cryptolestes (Ganglbauer) stored grain pest beetle species revealed gaps in public DNA databases that resulted in molecular diagnostic inconsistencies in publicly available sequence databases. We report the characterisation of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome oxidase I (mtCOI) genes from specimens intercepted during Australia’s border biosecurity inspections, and surveys of public mtCOI gene sequences, for Cryptolestes species status re-assessment. We identified and characterised a new putative Cryptolestes species (C. sp. ‘WTT-2016’) and demonstrated the close evolutionary relationships between C. ferrugineus (Stephens)/C. pusilloides (Steel and Howe) and between C. pusillus (Schonherr) and the previously identified C. sp. ‘WTT-2013’ cryptic species. Confusion between C. ferrugineus, C. pusiolloides, C. pusillus, C. sp. ‘WTT-2013’, and C. sp. ‘WTT-2016’ highlighted a substantial and persistent taxonomic challenge within Cryptolestes, while low C. spartii (Curtis)/C. corticinus (Reitter) inter-specific genetic distances suggested they were the same species. Assembled and annotated mitochondrial DNA genomes (mitogenomes) of six Cryptolestes species identified assembly errors in published mitogenomes of C. ferrugineus and C. turcicus (Grouvelle) and misidentification of C. pusillus. Based on re-evaluation of genetic distances and phylogeny congruence, we proposed a Cryptolestes ‘operational species-level genetic gap’ at approximately 5% to help define Cryptolestes species boundaries, thereby contributing to improving agricultural biosecurity preparedness associated with this important stored grain beetle species. Our work also provides an evolutionary framework that will contribute to future understanding of ecological and environmental impact posed by this highly invasive cryptic beetle species complex.",

    "Abstract": "This study proposes an efficient numerical scheme for simulating heat transfer governed by the diffusion equation with moving singular sources. The work addresses two-dimensional problems with line sources and three-dimensional problems with plane sources, which are prevalent in irreversible thermodynamic processes. Developed within a finite difference framework, the method employs a partitioned discretization strategy to accurately resolve the solution singularity near the heat source—a region critical for precise local entropy production analysis. In the immediate vicinity of the source, we analytically derive and incorporate the solution’s “jump” conditions to construct specialized finite difference approximations. Away from the source, standard second-order-accurate schemes are applied. This hybrid approach yields a globally second-order convergent spatial discretization. The resulting sparse system is efficient for large-scale simulation of dissipative systems. The accuracy and efficacy of the proposed method are demonstrated through numerical examples, providing a reliable tool for the detailed study of energy distribution in non-equilibrium thermal processes.",

    "Abstract": "Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary facial movements that reveal genuine emotions, holding significant value in fields like deception detection and psychological diagnosis. However, micro-expression recognition (MER) is fundamentally challenged by the entanglement of subtle emotional motions with identity-specific features. Traditional methods, such as those based on Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), attempt to separate identity and motion components through fixed preprocessing and coarse decomposition. However, these methods can inadvertently remove subtle emotional cues and are disconnected from subsequent module training, limiting the discriminative power of features. Inspired by the Bruce–Young model of facial cognition, which suggests that facial identity and expression are processed via independent neural routes, we recognize the need for a more dynamic, learnable disentanglement paradigm for MER. We propose LFD-TCMEN, a novel network that introduces an end-to-end learnable feature disentanglement framework. The network is synergistically optimized by a multi-task objective unifying orthogonality, reconstruction, consistency, cycle, identity, and classification losses. Specifically, the Disentangle Representation Learning (DRL) module adaptively isolates pure motion patterns from subject-specific appearance, overcoming the limitations of static preprocessing, while the Temporal-Complemented Motion Enhancement (TCME) module integrates purified motion representations—highlighting subtle facial muscle activations—with optical flow dynamics to comprehensively model the spatiotemporal evolution of MEs. Extensive experiments on CAS(ME)3 and DFME benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art cross-subject performance, validating the efficacy of the proposed learnable disentanglement and synergistic optimization.",

    "Abstract": "Aridity represents a fundamental climatic constraint governing water resources, ecosystem functioning, and agricultural systems in transitional climate zones. This study examines the spatial organization and temporal variability of aridity and thermal continentality in North Macedonia using observational records from 13 meteorological stations distributed across contrasting altitudinal and physiographic settings. The analysis is based on homogenized monthly and annual air temperature and precipitation series covering the period 1991–2020. Aridity and continentality were quantified using the Johansson Continentality Index (JCI), the De Martonne Aridity Index (IDM), and the Pinna Combinative Index (IP). Temporal consistency and trend behavior were evaluated using Pettitt’s nonparametric change-point test, linear regression, the Mann–Kendall test, and Sen’s slope estimator. Links between aridity variability and large-scale atmospheric circulation were examined using correlations with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). The results show a spatially consistent and statistically significant increase in mean annual air temperature, with a common change point around 2006, while precipitation displays strong spatial variability and limited temporal coherence. Aridity patterns display a strong altitudinal control, with extremely humid to very humid conditions prevailing in mountainous western regions and semi-humid to semi-dry conditions dominating lowland and southeastern areas, particularly during summer. Trend analyses do not reveal statistically significant long-term changes in aridity or continentality over the study period, although low-elevation stations exhibit weak drying tendencies. A moderate positive association between IDM and IP (r = 0.66) confirms internal consistency among aridity indices, while summer aridity shows a statistically significant relationship with the NAO. These results provide a robust climatic reference for North Macedonia, establishing a first climatological baseline of aridity conditions based on multiple indices applied to homogenized observations, and contributing to regional assessments of hydroclimatic variability relevant to climate adaptation planning.",

This study explores how key stakeholders perceive its implementation in Greece, focusing on educational policy, teacher preparedness, barriers, and age-appropriate content, with the aim of informing future practice and addressing gaps in early-years provision. The research employed qualitative design, and data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis, drawing on semi-structured interviews with stakeholders whose professional roles and institutional positions enable them to influence or inform educational policy. Findings indicate that the effective implementation of CSE in Greece requires addressing interconnected pedagogical, institutional, and sociopolitical challenges. Although stakeholders widely acknowledge CSE as crucial for children’s rights, health, protection, and inclusion, current provision remains limited and fragmented. Insufficient teacher training, social conservatism, political hesitancy, and the influence of the Church continue to undermine the establishment of comprehensive, evidence-based sexuality education.",

    "Abstract": "This study examined the value of Sentence Repetition (SRep) tasks as an ecologically valid tool for assessing bilingual children’s morphosyntactic competence. Seventy Greek–Turkish bilinguals and Greek monolinguals (aged 8–12) completed tasks assessing expressive vocabulary, morphological awareness, and SRep. Monolinguals significantly outperformed bilinguals across all tasks, with near-ceiling scores in grammaticality in SRep tasks reflecting earlier acquisition of core Greek structures. In contrast, bilinguals’ performance was significantly lower and varied across conditions: while scores were relatively higher on simple SVO, coordination, and wh-clauses, difficulties emerged in clitic left dislocation, complement clauses, and adverbial clauses—domains of greatest typological divergence between Greek and Turkish. Importantly, SRep performance on grammaticality did not vary with age, despite strong age effects on vocabulary and morphology, suggesting that SRep tasks indexes morphosyntactic knowledge rather than general maturational growth. Regression analyses showed that monolinguals’ SRep performance was best predicted by morphological awareness, whereas bilinguals relied more heavily on expressive vocabulary, reflecting their reduced exposure to Greek and reliance on lexical resources. These findings confirm the fairness and sensitivity of SRep for bilingual assessment, while highlighting the interplay of typological differences and input in shaping bilingual children’s morphosyntactic abilities.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents an all-digital fractional-N phase-locked loop (ADPLL) operating in the 2.86–3.2 GHz range, optimized for IoT and high-frequency RF transceiver applications demanding stringent phase noise performance, fast settling time, and high integration capability. The key innovation lies in the introduction of a bandpass delta-sigma time-to-digital converter (BPDSTDC) that achieves high-resolution phase detection, an extended detection range of ±2π, and superior noise-shaping characteristics, completely eliminating the complex calibration procedures typically required in conventional TDC designs. The proposed architecture synergistically combines the BPDSTDC with digital down-conversion blocks to extract phase error at baseband, a divider chain integrated with phase interpolators achieving 1/4 fractional resolution to suppress in-band quantization noise, and a wide-bandwidth digital loop filter (&gt;1 MHz) ensuring fast dynamic response and robust stability. The bandpass delta-sigma modulator is implemented with compact resonator structures and a flash quantizer, achieving an optimal balance among resolution, power consumption, and silicon area. The incorporation of highly linear phase interpolators extends fractional frequency synthesis capability without requiring complex digital-to-time converters (DTCs), significantly reducing design complexity and calibration overhead. Fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS technology, the proposed chip demonstrates robust measured performance. The band-pass delta-sigma TDC achieves a low integrated rms timing noise of 183 fs within a 1-MHz bandwidth. Leveraging this low TDC noise, the complete ADPLL exhibits a measured in-band phase noise of −120 dBc/Hz at a 1-MHz offset for a 3.2-GHz output frequency while operating with a loop bandwidth exceeding 1 MHz. This corresponds to a normalized phase noise of −216 dBc/Hz. The system operates from a 1.8-V supply and consumes 10 mW, achieving competitive performance compared with prior noise-shaping TDC-based all-digital PLLs.",

    "Abstract": "A novel resonant-type defected ground structure (DGS) featuring a modified internal structure is proposed to enhance the suppression of cross-polarized (XP) radiation of rectangular microstrip antennas (RMAs) on slot-type DGS. Specifically, integrating periodic circular metal structure (PCS) into the slot-type DGS, which has been demonstrated to reduce RMA XP levels and minimize the space occupied by defects. As a resonant-type DGS, the embedding of the PCS enables the excitation of the entire DGS by the fringe field of the patch. The coupling between the fringe field and the PCS-type DGS results in a significant alteration of the field distribution of the high-order mode TM02, thereby effectively suppressing the XP radiation generated by TM02 mode. This structural concept originates from the unique control capabilities of periodic structures over electromagnetic field propagation, with the objective of optimizing the symmetry of the substrate field distribution inside the defect region. Compared to slot-type DGS, the periodic structure enables more electromagnetic fields to couple into the slot from the non-radiating side and disperse among each metal element, generating resonance in the TM02 mode field. Experiments demonstrate the H-plane co-cross polarization isolation exceeds 25 dB across an azimuth range exceeding 200°, with peak XP suppression reaching 20 dB. This performance is at the forefront of resonant-type DGSs.",

    "Abstract": "This paper explores the feasibility of using acoustic wave propagation, particularly in the ultrasonic range, as a solution for data transmission in environments where traditional radio frequency (RF) communication is ineffective due to signal attenuation—such as in liquids or dense media like metal or stone. Leveraging GNU Radio and commercially available audio hardware, a low-cost, SDR (Software Defined Radio) system was developed to transmit data blocks (e.g., images, text, and audio) through various substances. The system employs BFSK (Binary Frequency Shift Keying) and BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying), operates at ultrasonic frequencies (typically 40 kHz), and has performance validated under real-world conditions, including water, viscous substances, and flammable liquids such as hydrocarbon fuels. Experimental results demonstrate reliable, continuous communication at Nyquist–Shannon sampling rates, with effective demodulation and file reconstruction. The methodology builds on concepts originally developed for Ad Hoc Sensor Networks in shipping containers, extending their applicability to submerged and RF-hostile environments. The modularity and flexibility of the GNU Radio platform allow for rapid adaptation across different media and deployment contexts. This work provides a reproducible and scalable communication solution for scenarios where RF transmission is impractical, offering potential applications in underwater sensing, industrial monitoring, railways, and enclosed infrastructure diagnostics. Across controlled laboratory experiments, the system achieved 100% successful reconstruction of transmitted image files up to 100 kB and sustained packet delivery success exceeding 98% under stable coupling conditions.",

    "Abstract": "With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources and power-electronic devices, modern power systems exhibit pronounced wideband oscillation characteristics with large frequency spans, strong modal coupling, and significant time-varying behaviors. Accurate identification and classification of wideband oscillation patterns have therefore become critical challenges for ensuring the secure and stable operation of “dual-high” power systems. Existing methods based on signal processing or single-modality deep-learning models often fail to fully exploit the complementary information embedded in heterogeneous data representations, resulting in limited performance when dealing with complex oscillation patterns.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multimodal attention-based fusion network for wideband oscillation classification. A dual-branch deep-learning architecture is developed to process Gramian Angular Difference Field images and raw time-series signals in parallel, enabling collaborative extraction of global structural features and local temporal dynamics. An improved Inception module is employed in the image branch to enhance multi-scale spatial feature representation, while a gated recurrent unit network is utilized in the time-series branch to model dynamic evolution characteristics. Furthermore, an attention-based fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively learn the relative importance of different modalities and perform dynamic feature aggregation. Extensive experiments are conducted using a dataset constructed from mathematical models and engineering-oriented simulations. Comparative studies and ablation studies demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional signal-processing-based approaches and single-modality deep-learning models in terms of classification accuracy, robustness, and generalization capability. The results confirm the effectiveness of multimodal feature fusion and attention mechanisms for accurate wideband oscillation classification, providing a promising solution for advanced power system monitoring and analysis.",

    "Abstract": "In today’s world, the demand for compact, high-efficiency, and low-cost motors plays a significant role in the design of low-power electric machines. In combi fan applications, single-phase brushless direct current (BLDC) motors are generally preferred. Although these motors offer efficient and compact solutions, the occurrence of dead points at certain rotor positions creates a serious disadvantage that may prevent the motor from initiating motion. In this study, an asymmetric air gap design is proposed for a single-phase BLDC motor to eliminate the dead point problem and increase starting torque. The motor’s performance has been evaluated through analytical calculations and two-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) conducted using ANSYS Electronics Desktop 2020 R2 (Maxwell) software. The results show that the asymmetric air gap effectively eliminates the dead point and improves the motor’s starting performance. However, torque ripple is still identified as a design parameter that must be considered. The scope of this study is not limited to single-phase BLDC motors; it also provides analytical approaches that can be applied to different electric motor designs, contributing to engineering applications in this field.",

    "Abstract": "The high energy consumption and cost of operation which result from substantial pressure losses during the transportation of crude oil over long-distance pipelines due to frictional drag created by turbulence are fundamental issues. In order to cope with such challenges, the current research intends to develop a simulation-based study that employs MATLAB R2016b and Minitab 21 to assess the effectiveness of drag-reducing agents (DRAs). An effective mathematical representation of the use of basic fluid mechanics with a semi-empirical correlation on the DRA performance is therefore created and its performance compared to actual pipeline data, showing good compatibility with experimental results. The findings show that DRA addition can produce a significant reduction in the pressure drop by 30–35% with an increase in the overall flow efficiency by 40–60%. Using 25 ppm DRA concentration at a Reynolds number of 323,159 enables an optimised prediction of 33.43% in drag reduction with an efficiency of 45.13%. Moreover, it is also found that there are considerable energy savings, flatter radial velocity profiles, and enhanced particle transport, which highlights the radical effect of DRAs on the hydrodynamics of flows. More importantly, it is determined that DRAs are one of the most effective and cost-efficient solutions to improve throughput and decrease the pumping power in the oil pipeline. However, further research is required to generalise the model to multiphase flows and use the newest optimisation algorithms to control the dosage dynamically.",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates the performance of a flat-plate solar collector thermal system located in Bucharest, Romania, by combining experimental measurements (December 2024–April 2025) with numerical modeling. The system, coupled to a 4000 L tank and using a 30% glycol–water mixture, was monitored for irradiance, wind speed, temperature, flow rate, and humidity. Monthly irradiance averaged 448–584 W/m2, and wind speed 2.3–4.3 m/s. Instantaneous efficiency ranged from 25.09% to 73.25% (mean 52.96%), with CUF (capacity utilization factor) ranging between 6.55% and 9.38%. Total heat losses were 4.80–7.79 kW and dominated by top losses (3.60–5.59 kW). The model reproduced the manufacturer’s efficiency curve within 5% for data obtained in the spring, with winter deviations of up to 37% due to weather variability and aged insulation. The results provide reference values for the CUF and loss coefficients of flat-plate collectors in temperate continental climates and can support retrofit and sizing decisions.",

    "Abstract": "With the integration of high-penetration power electronics, the dynamic characteristics of modern power systems are jointly dominated by synchronous generators (SGs) and virtual synchronous machines (VSMs). However, the accuracy of these system parameters cannot always be guaranteed in real-world scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose a robust parameter identification and correction framework based on trajectory sensitivity analysis and Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS). First, to identify the sources of dynamic anomalies, we employ trajectory sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of parameter variations and screen out key parameters for targeted identification. Subsequently, to utilize the readily available ambient measurements, we incorporate successive variational mode decomposition (SVMD). This method adaptively extracts the dominant variation modes, thereby recovering high-quality data for the identification process. Finally, to circumvent the weight degradation problem inherent in traditional particle filters, we propose a cost-effective PSIS algorithm to obtain the robust posterior distribution of modern system parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method. It can not only precisely estimate the key parameters of both SGs and VSMs but also realize the automatic correction of dynamic models under complex operating scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "The transition to renewable energy systems and electric mobility depends on the effectiveness, reliability, and durability of lithium-ion battery technology. Accurate modeling and control of battery systems are essential to ensure safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness in electric vehicles and grid storage. In engineering and materials science, battery models depend on physical parameters such as capacity, energy, state of charge (SOC), internal resistance, power, and self-discharge rate. These parameters are affected by measurement uncertainty. Despite the widespread use of lithium-ion cells, few studies quantify how measurement uncertainty propagates to derived battery parameters and affects predictive modeling. This study quantifies how uncertainty in voltage, current, and temperature measurements reduces the accuracy of derived parameters used for simulation and control. This work presents a comprehensive uncertainty analysis of 18650 format lithium-ion cells with nickel cobalt aluminum oxide (NCA), nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC), and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathodes. It applies the law of error propagation to quantify uncertainty in key battery parameters. The main result shows that small variations in voltage, current, and temperature measurements can produce measurable deviations in internal resistance and SOC. These findings challenge the common assumption that such uncertainties are negligible in practice. The results also highlight a risk for battery management systems that rely on these parameters for control and diagnostics. The results show that propagated uncertainty depends on chemistry because of differences in voltage profiles, kinetic limitations, and temperature sensitivity. This observation informs cell selection and testing for specific applications. Improved quantification and control of measurement uncertainty can improve model calibration and reduce lifetime and cost risks in battery systems. These results support more robust diagnostic strategies and more defensible warranty thresholds. This study shows that battery testing and modeling should report and propagate measurement uncertainty explicitly. This is important for data-driven and physics-informed models used in industry and research.",

    "Abstract": "Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) precipitation and Nanotrap® Microbiome Particles (NMP) are widely used methods for concentrating viruses in wastewater due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, efficiency, and rapid turnaround time. This study compared the performance of these methods in detecting noroviruses (GI and GII) and SARS-CoV-2 collected from two wastewater treatment facilities using quantitative PCR. Norovirus was detected in all samples (23/23) using both protocols, but PEG yielded higher mean concentrations for GI and GII than NMP, indicating improved quantitative recovery for non-enveloped viruses. For SARS-CoV-2, NMP showed significantly higher positive ratios for the N2 gene (Fisher’s Exact Test, p &lt; 0.01), but no significant difference was observed for the N1 gene (p &gt; 0.05), indicating comparable performance between the methods for this target. These findings highlight PEG’s effectiveness for non-enveloped viruses and NMP’s suitability for enveloped viruses, emphasizing the importance of selecting virus concentration methods based on viral structure. This study provides a framework for optimizing wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) protocols and enhancing public health surveillance for diverse viral targets. Future research should focus on refining these methodologies and exploring their applicability to other viral pathogens to enhance public health surveillance frameworks.",

    "Abstract": "Treatment of wastewater effluent is essential to reduce environmental impact and keep surface water clean, meeting sustainable criteria. While plant-based coagulants are known for their eco-friendly profiles, their dual application for high-efficiency nutrient removal and subsequent sludge valorization in fish farm systems remain under-explored. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the optimum conditions for using natural coagulants to recover nutrients from fish farm effluent. Two types of natural coagulants, Alhagi graecorum leaves and apricot seeds, were evaluated for the treatment and recovery of nutrients from fish farm effluent due to their high removal efficiency, non-toxicity, and cost-effectiveness. In this study, optimization was performed using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with a Central Composite Design (CCD) to investigate the effects of three factors: coagulant concentration (1000–7000 mg/L), wastewater pH (5–9), and settling time (15–35 min). The primary responses measured were the removal efficiencies of phosphate (PO4) and nitrate (NO3). According to the CCD results, maximum removal efficiencies reached 92.63% and 73.49% for PO4 and NO3, respectively. The optimal conditions were identified as pH 5, 1000 mg/L coagulant concentration, and a 35 min settling time for A. graecorum, and pH 9, 1000 mg/L concentration, and a 15 min settling time for apricot seed. These findings establish the optimal conditions for using these natural substances as effective agents for sustainable wastewater treatment and nutrient recovery.",

    "Abstract": "Forest structural parameters, such as canopy closure, stand density, diameter at breast height, tree height, leaf area index, stand age, and biomass, are fundamental for quantifying forest ecosystem functioning and supporting sustainable forest management. Remote sensing has become an indispensable tool for forest structural parameter estimation. Commonly used data sources include optical imagery, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), light detection and ranging (LiDAR), unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and multisource data fusion. Correspondingly, modeling approaches have evolved from empirical and statistical methods to machine learning, deep learning, and hybrid physical-data-driven models, enabling improved characterization of nonlinear and complex forest structures. Each data source and modeling strategy offers unique strengths and limitations with respect to accuracy, scalability, interpretability, and transferability. This review provides a concise synthesis of recent advances in remote sensing data sources and model algorithms for forest structural parameter estimation, evaluates the strengths and limitations of different sensors and algorithms, and highlights key challenges related to uncertainty, scalability, transferability, and model interpretability. Finally, future research directions are discussed, emphasizing cross-scale integration, multisource data fusion, and physically informed deep learning frameworks as promising pathways toward more accurate, robust, and ecologically interpretable forest structural parameter modeling at regional to global scales.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, the effects of Poland’s forest management evolution after 1945 on forest biodiversity at the genetic level were analysed. Forest biodiversity changes across the two politically and economically different eras (socialism, 1945–1989, and democracy, from 1990) are interpreted using three indirect indicators: forest regeneration and expansion, tree genetic resources, and threatened forest species. In the era of socialism, the total area of regeneration and reforestation gradually decreased, with these activities relying almost exclusively on cultivated reproductive material. After 1990, there was a relative stabilisation in the total area, with a noticeable increase in the use of natural processes to diversify the tree gene pool. Work on verifying and protecting the forest tree seed base, as well as on assessing the conservation status of an increasingly wide range of organisms, began in the era of socialism; however, it was intensified only in the era of democracy. In the latter case, the increase in the number of endangered species suggests a potentially negative trend. However, the actual assessment of the changes is not entirely clear due to subsequent changes in threat classification and increased knowledge of the occurrence of individual species. Dilemmas and problems related to the following issues require further discussion and resolution or implementation of further measures: the consequences of past choices regarding planted trees; the use of natural regeneration; the reduction in the forest tree gene pool as a result of artificial selection; incomplete knowledge about threats to the forest gene pool; the continued impact of threats and the possibilities for counteracting them; and securing funding for measures to protect biodiversity at the genetic level.",

    "Abstract": "Mezcal is an ancestral beverage from Oaxaca, Mexico, produced using traditional biotechnological procedures without artificial inoculation. The role of bacteria in fermentation has been studied less. Our work aimed to analyze the bacterial diversity in mezcal must and determine its relationship with ethnobiotechnological variables. Fermentation must samples were collected from four Palenques in the Valles Centrales, Cañada, and Mixteca regions of Oaxaca. Molecular and phenotypic identification and characterization, including ethanol tolerance testing, were performed. Ethnobiotechnological data were acquired through interviews and official databases. Six bacterial genera were identified in mezcal must, including Lactiplantibacillus, Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Bacillus, Leuconostoc, and Levilactobacillus. Therefore, through a factorial experiment, it was determined that the selected Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains were able to withstand 6% and 8% ethanol. A direct relationship was observed between species diversity and the degree of population marginalization. Palenque 2, representing the most urbanized population, exhibited the lowest diversity, with only two species detected. In contrast, Palenques characterized by high marginalization harbored a substantially greater diversity, ranging from six to ten species. These differences are likely associated with variations in microbiota composition, microbial growth dynamics, and ethanol tolerance. Overall, the findings suggest that ethnobiotechnological factors play a significant role in shaping bacterial diversity. In Oaxaca, “ethnobiotechnological” implies the deep relationship between biodiversity, Indigenous culture, and territory, with a strong emphasis on living traditional knowledge and its intergenerational transmission.",

In this study, endogenous yeast strains belonging to Kluyveromyces marxianus (n = 3), Yarrowia lipolytica (n = 3), Pichia fermentans (n = 3), and Debaryomyces hansenii (n = 3) were evaluated for their in vitro probiotic properties. A multi-criteria decision-making analysis using the Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) identified K. marxianus ETP12, P. fermentans SJ2023, and Y. lipolytica ARTP9.2 as the most promising strains for postbiotic production. Among them, K. marxianus ETP12 exhibited the highest functional potential and was subjected to comprehensive postbiotic characterization. The postbiotic of K. marxianus ETP12 was further characterized for total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity (DPPH and ABTS scavenging activities), phenolic compound profile, biofilm inhibition capacity, free amino acid composition, and fatty acid profile. The results revealed a diverse phenolic composition, primarily consisting of fumaric acid, quercetin, gallic acid, and quinic acid. A total of 29 essential, non-essential, and bioactive amino acids were identified, with lysine, leucine, and glycine as the predominant components. Fatty acid profiling indicated the predominance of palmitic and stearic acids, accompanied by medium-chain fatty acids. Notably, it exhibited strong biofilm-inhibition activity against S. aureus ATCC 25923 and C. sakazakii ATCC 29544. Overall, these findings demonstrate that K. marxianus ETP12 represents a valuable source of multifunctional postbiotics with potential applications in the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals.",

    "Abstract": "Background: In recent years, virtual consultations have emerged as a crucial approach for continuity of chronic care provision, indicating a promising avenue for the future of smart healthcare systems. However, reversions to in-person care highlight persistent limitations, despite notable advantages of remote modalities. In parallel, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) indicate the potential to enhance remote chronic care, but user perceptions of such assistance and the corresponding human factors remain underexplored. Objective: This mixed methods study aims to better understand the virtual consultation experiences and attitudes toward AI-assisted tools in remote care among patients with noncommunicable chronic conditions and their healthcare professionals (HCPs). It conducts an in-depth examination of the associated human–computer interaction and usability elements of virtual consultations and of potential AI assistance. Methods: Public and Patient Involvement was integrated to run pilots and refine documentations. Semi-structured interviews with patients (n = 10), focus groups with HCPs (n = 15), and an online survey (n = 83) were conducted. Qualitative data was analysed through a reflexive thematic approach. The survey comprised the Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ) and bespoke items on user AI views, and the data was used to triangulate the qualitative findings. Nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis tests and ε2 effect sizes compared TUQ and AI views scores between current and former virtual consultation user groups. Results: Seven themes emerged from the qualitative data, which were supported by the quantitative findings. The statistical analyses resulted in a mean TUQ total score of 90.6 (SD = 15.0), which indicates high usability and user satisfaction; however, they failed to detect a difference between groups (p &gt; 0.05; ε2 = 0.002–0.032). There was a clear preference for hybrid models, while a lack of empathy was identified during remote interactions. While a notable proportion of users indicated a literacy gap towards AI use in healthcare settings, they expressed cautious openness towards AI assistance, contingent upon transparency, human oversight, and data integrity; indicating a potential gap between competence to judge the technology and willingness to use it. Significant differences in views on AI assistance across groups failed to be detected (p &gt; 0.05; ε2 = 0.005–0.065). Conclusions: Virtual consultations for chronic conditions are widely usable and acceptable, particularly through hybrid approaches. Addressing empathic engagement, holistic patient status, and transparent AI integration can enhance clinical quality and user experiences during remote interactions. However, the low statistical power and failure to detect a difference between groups (likely due to the small sample size) indicate the need for caution when interpreting the quantitative findings. There is also the implicit need to address potential AI literacy gap among users, indicating the need for robust safeguard measures. This study has also identified evidence-based assistive AI features that can potentially enhance virtual consultations. These insights can inform the co-design of evidence-based virtual care platforms, policies and supportive AI tools to sustain remote chronic care delivery.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigated the characterization and application of organoclay formulations in a chemoautotrophic biofloc system. Organoclays were produced using the calcination method and bentonite, chitosan, corn, and tapioca starches as ingredients. Thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the high thermal stability of bentonite, whereas biopolymers (tapioca, chitosan, and corn starch) exhibited greater thermal sensitivity and a lower residual mass. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that organoclays had increased porosity (4–21 µm) compared to bentonite, while energy-dispersive spectroscopy confirmed the retention of key chemical elements. X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy indicated structural modifications due to thermal processing. In aqueous conditions, bentonite and organoclays disaggregated into particles with sizes between 0.76 and 1.24 μm. Based on these physicochemical properties, three formulations were selected for nitrification trials due to their stability in water, O1 (bentonite + tapioca), O2 (bentonite + tapioca + chitosan), and O6 (bentonite + corn starch), along with a 100% bentonite treatment and a control group (C) supplemented with inorganic salts and artificial Needlona® substrates. All treatments achieved full nitrification within 37 days, with O1 exhibiting the best performance by maintaining ammonia and nitrite levels within safe thresholds. These findings suggest that organoclays, particularly O1, can enhance nitrification stability, providing a promising strategy for water quality management in intensive aquaculture systems.",

    "Abstract": "In this work, for the first time, the dependence of the mass transfer (MT) ratio (kLa coefficient to overall gas holdup) as a function of the superficial gas velocity UG in seven organic liquids was studied. The volumetric liquid-phase MT coefficients kLa were recorded (by means of a polarographic oxygen electrode) in a bubble column (0.095 m in ID) equipped with a single tube (∅3.0 mm in ID) as a gas sparger. It was found that the MT ratio decreases monotonically through all main flow regimes. Both the constant and the exponent of the empirical correlation between the MT ratio and UG were analyzed, and it was found that they depended in a complicated fashion on the Schmidt number, Sc. In three different regions of the Sc number, potential new correlations were discussed. The main conclusion from this work is that the MT ratio is not constant in the heterogeneous regime as reported previously by other researchers. In the case of four binary mixtures between benzene and cyclohexane, it was also found that the MT ratio decreased monotonically as a function of the superficial gas velocity, UG. The effects of both liquid viscosity and surface tension on the MT ratio were also investigated.",

    "Abstract": "Marine bioactive substances exhibit structural diversity and function-specific properties, attracting considerable interest in their potential applications in targeted nutritional delivery to the gut and microbiota regulation. These bioactive components, sourced from seaweed, marine crustaceans, and microorganisms, including polysaccharides, polyphenols, and lipids, demonstrate exceptional biocompatibility and specific recognition capabilities. They serve as an optimal carrier matrix and functional core for developing an efficient, precision-targeted intestinal nutrition delivery system. Research findings demonstrate that optimization via innovative delivery technologies, including nanoencapsulation and polymer microsphere encapsulation, enables marine bioactive substances to navigate various physiological barriers in the gastrointestinal tract effectively. This facilitates targeted, sustained release of nutritional components and enhances bioavailability. Simultaneously, these substances may relieve dysbiosis by modulating the composition of the gut microbiota and the quantity and activity of specific metabolic products, thereby reinforcing intestinal barrier integrity. This narrative review systematically examines the sources and functional attributes of marine bioactive compounds, emphasizing their application strategies in developing targeted delivery systems for the gut and their regulatory effects on gut microbiota. It concludes by delineating future research directions in this field, particularly in optimizing carrier functionalities and clarifying action mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "In order to reduce fungal contamination in grapes and increase the dehydration rate for producing raisins, the development of alternative technologies that do not compromise product safety and quality is required. This study examined the impact of innovative pre-drying methods using aqueous ozone (10 min-4.1 mg O3 L−1) and UV-C light (30.3 kJ m−2 UV-C) on the incidence of Aspergillus carbonarius, as well as on air-drying kinetics and ultrastructure of epicuticular waxes in Sultanina grapes, when applied either individually or sequentially. The effect of the pre-treatments on the colour of the dehydrated grapes was also assessed. Grapes pre-treated with 30.3 kJ m−2 UV-C and 10 min-4.1 mg O3 L−1 + 30.3 kJ m−2 UV-C showed a lower incidence of A. carbonarius in storage at 20 ± 1 °C than those exposed to aqueous ozone (30 and 8% lower infection compared to the non-pretreated fruit at 15-day storage, respectively). Although the combined pre-treatment did not significantly improve the fungus inhibition with respect to the individual UV-C application, it allowed a higher dehydration rate during the drying process at 60 ± 1 °C. The drying time was reduced by ~31% compared to non-pretreated fruit, a result slightly lower than that achieved with the traditional chemical pre-treatment of ethyl oleate-K2CO3 (~39%). This enhancement in drying rate was partly attributed to marked alterations in the grape’s epicuticular wax layer. UV-C and the combined pre-treatment helped in reducing the browning of raisins. Therefore, the combined application of ozone and UV-C light could be an environmentally friendly alternative for both improving the microbiological quality of grapes and accelerating the drying process.",

    "Abstract": "This study assessed consumer perceptions of high-fat, low-carbohydrate (HFLC) protein bars containing varying levels of beef tallow fat. A consumer acceptability test was conducted (n = 102) with four prepared and one commercially available HFLC bar samples. Hedonic, diagnostic (intensity), and just-about-right (JAR) questions on overall liking, texture, flavor, and purchase intent were included in the sample evaluation ballot, followed by general demographic, consumption behavior, and ingredient preference questions about the product category. Although none of the samples, including the commercial bar, were liked, the sample with the highest protein content and lowest fat content was preferred over the others. Overall flavor and aroma liking were rated significantly higher for all prepared samples compared with the commercial bar (p ≤ 0.05). The sample evaluation revealed potential pathways for improving HFLC bars by leveraging “fat-synergizing” attributes such as sweetness, saltiness, and spiciness, with texture improvements possible through higher lean-protein incorporation. The ingredient factors most important to the participants were high protein content, high satiety, minimal ingredients, natural ingredients, and no added sugar. This study’s results demonstrate a widespread desire for fewer ingredients overall, more natural ingredients, and high satiation in snack products.",

    "Abstract": "As a source of non-protein nitrogen, ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is widely utilized in ruminant diets to reduce feed costs. However, the impact of its supplementation level on the flavor of sheep meat remains unclear, despite the known influence of fat on meat flavor. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary NH4Cl supplementation levels on the lipidome and flavor compounds of subcutaneous adipose tissue in Tibetan sheep, providing a scientific basis for dietary optimization in Tibetan sheep farming. Eighty 2-month-old early-weaned Tibetan lambs were selected and randomly allocated into four groups, fed diets supplemented with 0% (N0 group), 1.49% (N1 group), 2.24% (N2 group), and 3.01% (N3 group) NH4Cl for an experimental period of 105 days. The study conducted histomorphological observations, lipidomics analysis, and determination of flavor compounds. The results showed that NH4Cl supplementation significantly reduced (p &lt; 0.05) the contents of various unsaturated fatty acids and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) in the subcutaneous adipose tissue of Tibetan sheep. Specifically, the total saturated fatty acid (total SFA) content in the N3 group was significantly higher than that in the other groups, while the total monounsaturated fatty acid (total MUFA) content was significantly lower than that in the N1 and N2 groups (p &lt; 0.05). The absolute contents of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and the sum of triglycerides (TGs) and diglycerides (DGs) in the N3 group were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than those in the other groups. Regarding flavor compounds, the contents of ketone aroma compounds, such as 2-propanone and 2-butanone monomer, were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in the N0 group than in the other groups. The ammonia content in the N1 and N3 groups was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than that in the N0 and N2 groups, while the allyl sulfide content in the N2 group was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than that in the other groups. Correlation analysis revealed that the majority of TG and DG differential lipids were significantly positively correlated with allyl sulfide, and most differential lipids belonging to the PC, PE, and hexosylceramide (Hex1Cer) classes were significantly positively correlated with ammonia (|r| ≥ 0.80, p &lt; 0.01). Conversely, PC (16:0_18:3) exhibited significant negative correlations with multiple beneficial aroma compounds (|r| ≥ 0.80, p &lt; 0.01). The study indicates that dietary NH4Cl supplementation levels exceeding 2.24% are associated with alterations in lipid metabolism and reduced synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and beneficial flavor compounds, such as 2-propanone and 2-butanone, in subcutaneous adipose tissue. This is also associated with the abnormal accumulation of phospholipids and ceramides, which correlate strongly with elevated ammonia concentrations in adipose tissue and the generation of oxidation products such as propanal, potentially compromising meat flavor quality.",

    "Abstract": "Covalent modification of polyphenols effectively enhances functional properties of proteins. This study conjugated potato protein isolate (PPI) with gallic acid (GA) via an alkaline method to investigate structural and functional alterations. Successful conjugation was confirmed by a significant decrease in free amino and sulfhydryl groups, coupled with a marked increase in total phenolic content. Multispectroscopic analyses indicated a loosening of the secondary structure and notable changes in the tertiary conformation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations corroborated these findings, revealing that GA conjugation induced conformational expansion, improved structural stability, and enhanced surface hydrophilicity. These structural modifications led to substantial functional improvements in the PPI-GA conjugates, including enhanced dispersion stability, improved emulsifying performance, strengthened antioxidant activity, and increased thermal stability. This research may provide effective strategy and technical support for the improvement of functional properties of PPI and expand its application in the food industry.",

    "Abstract": "Thailand’s Western New Year and Songkran festivals witness a surge in traffic crashes due to increased travel volume. This study explores risk factors influencing crash injury severity during these holidays (2017–2019). Crash data is analyzed using both the Random Parameters Ordered Logit Model with Means Heterogeneity (RPOLHM) and machine learning techniques (Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest). Crash severity is categorized as property damage only (PDO), minor injury, and severe/fatal injury. The results reveal that factors like motorcycle or pedestrian involvement, adverse weather, speeding, drunk driving, fatigue, nighttime conditions, improper overtaking, and urban location all significantly increase the risk of severe/fatal crashes. Notably, the XGBoost model outperforms both RPOLHM and other machine learning methods, achieving a validation accuracy of 83.8%. While machine learning approaches demonstrate superior predictive capability, RPOLHM provides interpretable coefficient estimates and marginal effects essential for understanding causal mechanisms. This complementarity suggests that concurrent application of both paradigms offers comprehensive insights: machine learning for prediction-oriented objectives and econometric models for policy formulation. These findings provide valuable guidance for policymakers, highway engineers, and researchers to develop targeted road safety interventions during these high-risk periods.",

    "Abstract": "The utilization of microorganisms as biocontrol agents represents a sustainable alternative to agrochemicals. Trichoderma spp. has been identified as a fungus that promotes plant growth and suppresses phytopathogens. Nonetheless, conventional commercial formulations are constrained by factors such as their limited shelf life, environmental sensitivity, and inadequate carrier systems. In this study, Trichoderma harzianum (T22) and T. viride (T18) strains were encapsulated in a hydrogel composed of chitosan, gelatin, and polyvinyl alcohol, which was prepared by pH-induced gelation via alkaline precipitation. The characterization of the hydrogels was conducted in several domains. Initially, the water absorption of the samples was examined at varying pH values. Secondly, the morphology of the samples was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and stereo microscopy. Thirdly, the chemical interactions in the hydrogels were analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The final stage of the experiment involved assessing the degradation behaviour of the hydrogels in both sterile and inoculated soils. The efficacy of the isolates in protecting chilli plants from Phytophthora capsici was subsequently evaluated. As demonstrated in the extant research, encapsulation techniques have been shown to preserve the viability of fungal organisms and promote their growth after 10 days of storage at ambient temperature. These effects have been observed to exhibit strain-dependent variations. It is noteworthy that hydrogels loaded with T. viride (HT18) induced resistance against P. capsici, resulting in complete symptom suppression and enhanced plant growth, whereas hydrogels loaded with T. harzianum (HT22) showed no protective effect. These results demonstrate the potential of the hydrogel formulated with T18 as an effective carrier, as it maintains Trichoderma spp. viability and protects chilli plants against P. capsici infection.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: The Bedouins (nomads) and the Fellahin (farmers) of Jordan represent two distinct subpopulations, characterized by unique lifestyles, settlement patterns, and linguistic features. This study aims to estimate the frequency of 27 Y-STRs in these two Jordanian subpopulations, along with various forensic parameters and paternal lineage comparisons with neighboring populations. Methods: Twenty-seven Y-STRs were typed in two major Jordanian subpopulations: Bedouin nomads (n = 101) and Fellahin farmers (n = 98). The forensic and paternal genetic lineage parameters and Y-haplogroup predictions were estimated. In addition, we conducted multidimensional scaling (MDS) and centroid analyses based on the Fst distance matrix to compare the sampled communities with neighboring populations from the MENA region, East Africa, Southeast Europe, and South Asia. Results: The Y-haplogroup predictions revealed differences in the predicted lineage composition based on the Y-STR profiles. The predicted J1a2a1a2 haplogroup predominated among the Bedouins (74.3%), whereas the Fellahin displayed a more heterogeneous profile, with notable frequencies of J1 (40%) and J2 (17.3%). Furthermore, the Fellahin exhibited remarkable genetic diversity and significant gene flow, providing plausible evidence of kinship with neighboring Levantine and Arabian groups. In contrast, the Bedouins showed consistently lower diversity across multiple loci, indicating long-term tribal isolation and, therefore, the potential effects of genetic drift. The MDS and centroid analyses positioned the Fellahin among the genetically interconnected Middle Eastern populations, while the Bedouins were clustered with the Arabian Peninsula populations. Conclusions: Overall, the contrasting genetic signatures of the two Jordanian subpopulations reflect their settlement patterns and sociocultural practices. In addition, the Y-STR dataset generated in this study enhances the Jordanian forensic database and to extends our understanding of paternal lineage structures in the West Asian/Levantine region.",

    "Abstract": "African grasses deliberately introduced for cattle forage have become among the most destructive invaders of tropical wetlands globally, yet invasion mechanisms and management strategies remain poorly understood. We conducted field experiments examining competition dynamics between the invasive African grass Echinochloa pyramidalis and native wetland species in La Mancha, Mexico—a Ramsar site of international importance. Experiment 1 tested invasion potential within native Sagittaria lancifolia zones using four treatments: control, herbicide removal, E. pyramidalis transplant, and combined removal + transplant. Repeated-measures ANOVA showed significant treatment and time effects on invasion success, with vegetation removal facilitating invasion (relative importance value increasing from 0 to 149.4 ± 26.6 after 18 months) while transplants alone failed to establish (RIV &lt; 7.0). Sagittaria maintained 35–48% biomass across treatments, demonstrating coexistence capacity. Experiment 2 examined natural invasion of the vegetation ecotone over 49 months. Mixed-effects models revealed that E. pyramidalis increased dominance in its zone (β = 9.98, z = 4.77, p &lt; 0.001) but showed minimal expansion into the adjacent Sagittaria habitat, indicating propagule limitation rather than competitive exclusion as the invasion constraint. Sagittaria removal within E. pyramidalis zones significantly reduced invasion temporal increase (β = −6.44, z = −2.18, p = 0.030), suggesting biotic resistance. Results demonstrate that E. pyramidalis possesses invasion potential but requires disturbance to overcome establishment barriers. These findings support prevention-based management prioritizing disturbance limitation in intact wetlands and demonstrate that hydrological management maintaining permanent flooding (&gt;30 cm depth) can effectively control established invasions by exploiting C4 photosynthetic limitations. Conservation implications for Mexican coastal wetlands—which lack legal protection equivalent to mangroves despite comparable ecosystem services—are discussed. These findings inform evidence-based management of African grass invasions in tropical wetlands worldwide.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is a common extraintestinal complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Among high-dose intravenous (IV) iron options, ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) carries a higher risk of treatment-emergent hypophosphatemia than ferric derisomaltose (FDI), with potential clinical consequences. Slovenia’s healthcare setting, characterized by very low IV iron infusion tariffs and recent pricing in which FCM is substantially less expensive than FDI, warrants a setting-specific cost effectiveness evaluation. Methods: We integrated two methodological components: (i) a payer-perspective cost-effectiveness analysis using a patient-level microsimulation model with (ii) an umbrella review of systematic reviews and a targeted search of expert consensus statements on IV-iron-associated hypophosphatemia. Results: In the base case, FDI required fewer infusions than FCM (11.1 vs. 14.2 over 10 years) but generated only €95 in IV iron administration savings due to low tariffs, while drug procurement was €1166 higher with FDI than FCM. When incorporating the clinical impact of hypophosphatemia, incremental quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were 0.136, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €6590/QALY. The umbrella review consistently showed higher hypophosphatemia incidence with FCM (up to 92%) compared with other IV iron formulations (&lt;10%), with recent recommendations emphasizing phosphate monitoring and risk mitigation through alternative formulations. Conclusions: Despite Slovenia’s low IV iron infusion tariffs and lower FCM price, FDI remained cost-effective in this model, largely due to its more favorable hypophosphatemia profile within the model. These findings suggest that hypophosphatemia risk should be considered when selecting IV iron therapy in routine IBD care.",

    "Abstract": "The genus Thymus L. is characterized by high taxonomic complexity and pronounced phytochemical polymorphism, which underlie its economic and medicinal importance. While a limited number of species (Thymus vulgaris, Thymus pulegioides, Thymus × citriodorus) are traditionally cultivated, the cultivation potential of many Balkan taxa remains poorly explored. The present study aimed to evaluate the field cultivation performance, essential oil yield, and chemotype differentiation of three traditional and three lesser-studied Thymus species (Thymus zygioides Griseb., Thymus longedentatus (Degen &amp; Urum.) Ronniger, and Thymus pannonicus All.). Plants were established through vegetative propagation and cultivated under field conditions, followed by essential oil isolation and GC–MS analysis. The newly introduced species exhibited higher essential oil yields, reaching 2.30% in T. longedentatus, 1.48% in T. pannonicus, and 0.94% in T. zygioides, compared to 0.24–0.60% in traditionally cultivated species. Clear and species-specific chemotypes were identified: a citral (neral/geranial) chemotype in T. longedentatus, a thymol chemotype in T. zygioides, and a sesquiterpene-dominated profile in T. pannonicus. In contrast, traditionally cultivated species displayed overlapping and less differentiated chemical profiles. All species were propagated vegetatively and cultivated in an open-field experimental plantation under temperate continental climatic conditions, following environmentally responsible horticultural practices. Vegetative propagation ensured genetic uniformity and supported consistent chemotype expression of the planting material under the applied cultivation conditions. These results demonstrate that species-based selection represents a robust alternative to conventional thyme cultivation, enabling higher essential oil productivity, clearer chemotypic differentiation, and improved standardization for horticultural and medicinal plant production, while supporting the sustainable use of native Bulgarian biodiversity.",

    "Abstract": "To address the challenges of low manual harvesting efficiency and high difficulty in automated picking of safflower filaments in the unstructured field environments of Xinjiang, this study proposes an intelligent harvesting method that integrates lightweight visual detection and adaptive localization. Firstly, a safflower image dataset covering multiple scenarios and growth stages was constructed. An improved lightweight detection model, named SSO-YOLO, was proposed based on the YOLOv11n model. By introducing the StarNet backbone network, the SEAttention mechanism, and structural optimization, this model achieves a high detection accuracy (mAP@0.5 of 97.4%) while reducing the model size by 29.4% to 3.94 MB, significantly enhancing its deployment feasibility on mobile devices. Secondly, based on the detection results, an adaptive localization algorithm for picking points was developed. This algorithm achieves precise localization of picking points at the filament–flower head junction by integrating geometric analysis of filament growth posture, dynamic judgment of connection conditions, and intersection calculation of rotated bounding boxes. Experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm achieves an average localization success rate of 87.3% across various unstructured scenarios such as occlusion and backlighting, representing an improvement of approximately 10.7 percentage points over traditional methods. The estimation error for filament posture angle is merely 0.6°, and the localization success rate remains above 90% across the entire growth cycle. This study provides an efficient and robust visual solution for the automated harvesting of safflower filaments and offers valuable insights for advancing intelligent harvesting technologies for specialty cash crops.",

    "Abstract": "Reliable observation of water resources is a major challenge for sustainable development, particularly in the river-centric deltaic countries like Bangladesh, where the data is generally scarce. Leveraging operational satellites, this study presents a real-time capable water level (WL), discharge (Q), and floodplain monitoring framework implemented for the Brahmaputra River in Bangladesh. The multi-satellite approach presented here combined satellite altimetry, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and optical imagery. A set of WL time series is obtained first from Jason-2/3 and Sentinel-3 altimetry, while a combination of Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images is used to extract the floodplain extent. Seasonal Rating Curve (RC) models are then developed to estimate Q from the river WL (altimetry) and width (imagery). The altimetry WL measurement is further complemented by the width-based Q utilizing an inverse RC. Furthermore, the water level is combined with a floodplain map to extract floodplain topography and its evolution. The proposed framework provides consistent and reliable observations in the Brahmaputra River, with a bias, root mean-squared errors (RMSEs), and correlation coefficient of 0.03 m, 0.68 m, and 0.96 for WL, and −168.22 m3/s, 4161.46 m3/s, and 0.97 for Q, respectively, relative to a mean discharge of approximately 30,000 m3/s. The locations of high erosion–accretion across the river reach are also well-captured in the evolving floodplain maps. By integrating multiple satellite altimetry missions with SAR and optical imagery, the multi-satellite approach reduces the effective monitoring interval for both water level and discharge from approximately 10 days (single-mission altimetry) to about 4 days, enabling improved capture of extreme events such as floods. As the operational satellites used in this study are expected to provide long-term observations, the proposed framework supports sustainable monitoring of floodplain dynamics in Bangladesh and other similar data-poor environments, towards informed water management under ongoing climatic and anthropogenic changes.",

    "Abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral driver of digital transformation in the banking sector, fundamentally influencing operational efficiency, resource allocation, and profitability. This study investigates how AI adoption affects the profitability of Chinese commercial banks and through which mechanisms these effects occur, within the context of the country’s broader financial digitalization process. Using panel data for 17 A-share listed banks in China from 2009 to 2022, we employ a multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) framework—whose validity rests on the parallel trend assumption, empirically verified through an event-study specification—and combine it with propensity score matching (PSM) and placebo simulations to ensure credible causal identification. The results indicate that AI adoption significantly improves bank profitability. Mechanism analyses suggest that AI enhances profitability through two overarching channels—operational efficiency and resource allocation—manifested in (i) higher cost elasticity of income, (ii) improved deposit–loan turnover adaptability via more efficient liquidity and funding-cycle management, and (iii) optimized cross-business capital allocation efficiency through better risk–return matching in diversified operations. The effects are stronger for banks with higher digital investment intensity and tighter customer stickiness–liability cost coupling, and vary systematically across ownership types, bank sizes, and policy cycles. Overall, the findings provide policy-relevant evidence on how AI-driven digital transformation can enhance bank performance and risk management in modern financial systems. This study contributes by constructing a disclosure-based AI adoption measure from bank annual reports and exploiting staggered adoption with a multi-period DID design to provide causal evidence from China’s listed banking sector.",

    "Abstract": "This review introduces and elaborates a novel temporal paradigm, the “Gout Inflammation Time Programming” model, conceptualized through the Gout-STAT™ framework. This model redefines gout inflammation as a dynamic continuum progressing through three precisely timed phases: an acute Perception phase (0–24 h) initiated by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal recognition, triggering the NOD-like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome and neutrophil-driven burst; a critical Adaptation phase (24–72 h) where outcomes are determined by immunometabolic reprogramming of macrophages and synovial fibroblasts; and a chronic Tissue Injury phase (&gt;72 h) driven by epigenetic memory, leading to irreversible osteoarticular destruction. Deciphering this programmed timeline reveals distinct therapeutic windows. We propose a shift towards stage-specific precision interventions, targeting upstream triggers (e.g., mitochondrial reactive oxygen species(ROS), neutrophil extracellular trap formation (NETosis)) in the acute phase, correcting metabolic checkpoints (e.g., succinate accumulation, impaired autophagy) during adaptation, and employing tissue-protective strategies (e.g., epigenetic modulators) in the chronic phase. Furthermore, we highlight the pivotal role of cutting-edge translational technologies, such as intelligent drug delivery systems and digital twin joint models, in achieving spatiotemporal precision. Understanding this intrinsic molecular clock is fundamental for advancing gout management from reactive treatment to a predictive, preventive, and personalized 4P medicine approach.",

    "Abstract": "Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers constitute an umbrella term for a wide variety of malignancies that are located in the digestive tract (esophageal, gastric, small and large intestine, anus, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas), with 25% of total cancers and 35% of cancer-related deaths being attributed to them. An alarming trend of rising GI malignancy diagnoses, especially in younger age groups, underscores the need for discoveries in liquid-based biomarkers that facilitate both early detection and optimal disease management. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) not only constitute promising nano-sized biomarkers, but also, via bioengineering, have shown a great therapeutic potential, with artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionizing their research via the selection of the best biomarkers from omics, the recognition of pathophysiological patterns, and facilitating a faster drug-development via AI-driven EV engineering, drug delivery modeling, and target identification. In this review, we will provide a clear insight into the implementation of AI methodologies in EV-based biomarker discovery and therapeutics for pancreatic and hepatobiliary cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Mycobacterial diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), remain the major health and economic challenges in livestock, underscoring the need to characterise the innate immune mechanisms involved in early bacterial containment. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are the first line of defence against inhaled mycobacteria, yet the functional links between activation, polarisation, and phagocytic capacity in caprine AMs remain poorly defined. In this study, we compared a pH-dependent live-cell fluorescence assay with a culture-based method to evaluate phagocytosis and clearance of Mycobacterium fortuitum under different immunostimulatory conditions. AMs were stimulated in vitro with LPS or Heat-inactivated Mycobacterium bovis (HIMB), and phagocytosis was assessed alongside activation and pro-inflammatory markers. Both approaches showed that LPS stimulation significantly enhanced mycobacterial clearance, despite reduced initial bacterial uptake. Moreover, this improved phagocytic capacity was associated with increased expression of the inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS), MHCII, CD80, and CD86, as well as an elevated production of some pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, HIMB induced cytokine secretion but failed to enhance activation markers or bacterial clearance. Collectively, these results establish the first association between pro-inflammatory activation and functional mycobacterial phagocytosis in caprine AMs and validate a robust methodological framework for studying innate immune responses relevant to TB and vaccine development in goats.",

    "Abstract": "The tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in cancer progression, with oxidative stress, autophagy, angiogenesis, and cell migration acting as tightly interconnected processes. Natural bioactive compounds have emerged as promising modulators of these pathways; however, their cell type-specific effects within the TME remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the effects of punicalin on triple-negative breast cancer and endothelial cells, with a focus on redox homeostasis and autophagy as upstream regulatory mechanisms. Punicalin reduced oxidative stress in MDA-MB-231 cells under basal conditions and strongly attenuated hydrogen peroxide-induced stress, whereas HMEC-1 cells exhibited concentration- and condition-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulation. Autophagy assays revealed no significant modulation in tumor cells, while a consistent and pronounced decrease in autophagic activity was observed in endothelial cells under both basal and nutrient-deprivation conditions. Functionally, punicalin decreased tumor cell migration and impaired HMEC-1 migration, while HUVEC migration remained largely unaffected. Tube formation assays demonstrated significant inhibition of angiogenic capacity. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that punicalin selectively modulates oxidative stress and autophagy, leading to functional alterations in migration and angiogenesis. By highlighting its selective impact on microvascular endothelial cells while sparing normal endothelium, this study provides a strong rationale for further preclinical evaluation of punicalin.",

    "Abstract": "Studies of adult depressed patients report that selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) like clomipramine (CMI) have secondary effects on sperm quality. The epididymis possesses an autonomous serotonergic system critical for sperm maturation, whose establishment during neonatal development remains unexplored as a target for SSRI programming. We hypothesized that neonatal CMI exposure would disrupt the developing epididymal 5-HT system, leading to permanent sperm dysfunction. CMI (30 mg/kg s.c.) was administered to male rats between postnatal days 8–21. At 3 months, sperm from the epididymal cauda was evaluated, and 5-HT levels were measured in the testis, caput, and cauda epididymis. Our novel findings demonstrate that neonatal CMI exposure induces region-specific, long-term alterations in epididymal 5-HT levels (decreased in caput, increased in cauda) without affecting testicular 5-HT. This reprogramming of the local serotonergic milieu was associated with reduced sperm concentration, viability, normal morphology, and motility, alongside increased mitochondrial activity and reactive oxygen species. This study reveals, for the first time, that the epididymal serotonergic system is a key target for neonatal SSRI programming, providing a mechanistic link (altered 5-HT homeostasis) between early-life exposure and persistent sperm defects in adulthood.",

    "Abstract": "Gallic acid (GA) is a natural polyphenol abundantly found in a variety of fruits, including blackberries, apples, pineapples, strawberries, bananas, and grapes. With prominent anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, GA effectively mitigates inflammation and oxidative stress. Furthermore, it plays a significant role in modulating various cellular processes and biological activities, ultimately inhibiting the progression of pathogenesis. This review explores the multifaceted health benefits of GA, highlighting its role as antidiabetic, anti-obesity, anti-arthritis, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective, and neuroprotective effects. Additionally, its impact on the respiratory, digestive, and reproductive systems, along with its related pathogenesis, is described. Additionally, its role as an antimicrobial is defined primarily through mechanisms such as disruption of microbial cell membranes, inhibition of efflux pumps, and antibiofilm activity. Moreover, this review provides a novel, integrative analysis of GA by unifying its mechanistic roles across various pathogenesis. It further describes the role of GA in cancer management via the modulation of signaling pathways. In addition, it demonstrates the synergistic effects of GA when used in combination with other drugs/compounds and discusses nanoformulation approaches that improve its therapeutic efficacy. However, despite significant preclinical outcomes, the clinical application of GA is limited by a shortage of human trials, low bioavailability, and an inadequate understanding of its mechanisms of action and optimal dosage. To overcome these limitations, well-designed clinical trials, in vivo studies, and advanced nanoformulation approaches are required to enhance bioavailability, elucidate mechanisms of action, and increase knowledge of safety and long-term toxicity. Addressing these gaps will enable the full exploration of GA’s benefits in disease prevention and management.",

    "Abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have improved outcomes in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The influence of statin use, chemotherapy, PD-L1 expression, and sex on immunotherapy outcomes remains incompletely defined in real-world settings. We performed a multicenter retrospective analysis of patients with advanced NSCLC treated with immunotherapy-based regimens. Patients were stratified by statin exposure, chemotherapy use, PD-L1 expression (&lt;1% vs. ≥1%), and sex. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed using Kaplan–Meier estimates and log-rank tests. Statin use was not associated with a significant OS benefit, while a numerical improvement in PFS was observed in selected subgroups. Among immunotherapy-treated patients, OS did not differ significantly by chemotherapy or statin use (median range, 19–27 months), whereas PFS differed significantly, with the longest PFS observed in patients receiving immunotherapy plus statins (26 months; p = 0.046). PD-L1 expression was the strongest determinant of outcomes, with PD-L1 ≥ 1% tumors demonstrating markedly longer OS and PFS compared with PD-L1 &lt; 1% disease (OS up to 31 vs. 16 months; PFS up to 21 vs. 12 months; p &lt; 0.001). No significant differences in OS or PFS were observed by sex or statin exposure (OS, 23–27 months; PFS, 14–19 months). In this real-world cohort, PD-L1 expression remained the primary predictor of survival outcomes following immunotherapy. Statin use was associated with modest PFS improvements but no consistent OS benefit, while sex did not significantly influence outcomes. These findings support continued reliance on established biomarkers and warrant prospective evaluation of statins as potential adjuncts to immunotherapy.",

We investigated whether an ethanolic extract of Diospyros kaki leaves (EEDK) attenuates LPA-induced fibrosis and explored the underlying mechanisms. HTM cells were stimulated with LPA and treated with ethanol-based EEDK extracts. Expression of ECM/fibrosis-related genes (FN1, ACTA2, COL1A1, COL3A1, COL4A1, COL6A2, CCN2) and EMT markers (CDH2, VIM, SNAI1) was assessed, along with cell migration using a wound-healing assay. Upstream regulatory pathways were examined via transcription factor prediction, AP-1 reporter assays, and analyses of MAPK/AP-1 signaling. Among the extracts tested, the 70% ethanol EEDK extract showed the strongest antifibrotic activity, significantly reducing LPA-induced ECM gene/protein expression and inhibiting HTM cell migration in a dose-dependent manner, whereas the 90% ethanol extract showed minimal effects. LPA robustly activated MAPK-dependent AP-1 signaling, and either pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK pathways or treatment with 70% ethanol EEDK comparably suppressed AP-1 activity and decreased downstream ECM/EMT gene expression. Thus, 70% ethanol EEDK mitigates LPA-induced TM fibrosis by inhibiting MAPK/AP-1-mediated transcription, supporting its potential as an antifibrotic strategy for glaucoma.",

    "Abstract": "Morbid obesity is a complex, multifactorial disorder characterized by metabolic and inflammatory dysregulation. The aim of this study was to observe changes in obese patients adhering to a personalized nutrition plan based on multi-omic data. This study included 14 adult patients with a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 40 kg/m2 who were consecutively recruited from those presenting to our outpatient clinic and who met the inclusion criteria. Clinical, biochemical, hormonal, and glycomic parameters were assessed, along with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) that included a focused analysis of obesity-associated genes and an extended analysis encompassing genes related to cardiometabolic disorders, hereditary cancer risk, and nutrigenetic profiles. Patients were stratified into nutrigenetic clusters using a patented unsupervised machine learning platform (German Patent Office, No. DE 20 2025 101 197 U1), which was employed to generate personalized nutrigenetic dietary recommendations for patients with morbid obesity to follow over a six-month period. At baseline, participants exhibited elevated glucose, insulin, homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglycerides, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, consistent with insulin resistance and chronic low-grade inflammation. The majority of participants harbored risk alleles within the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (FTO) and the interleukin-6 gene (IL-6), together with multiple additional significant variants identified across more than 40 genes implicated in metabolic regulation and nutritional status. Using an AI-driven clustering model, these genetic polymorphisms delineated a uniform cluster of patients with morbid obesity. The mean GlycanAge index (56 ± 12.45 years) substantially exceeded chronological age (32 ± 9.62 years), indicating accelerated biological aging. Following a six-month personalized nutrigenetic dietary intervention, significant reductions were observed in both BMI (from 52.09 ± 7.41 to 34.6 ± 9.06 kg/m2, p &lt; 0.01) and GlycanAge index (from 56 ± 12.45 to 48 ± 14.83 years, p &lt; 0.01). Morbid obesity is characterized by a pro-inflammatory and metabolically adverse molecular signature reflected in accelerated glycomic aging. Personalized nutrigenetic dietary interventions, derived from AI-driven analysis of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, effectively reduced both BMI and biological age markers, supporting integrative multi-omics and machine learning approaches as promising tools in precision-based obesity management.",

This study investigates how restriction alters the fetal sheep hepatic methylome and its potential regulatory influence on gene expression. Using a monozygotic twin model generated through embryo splitting, we examined hepatic DNA methylation responses to maternal nutrient restriction (50% vs. 100% NRC nutritional requirements; n = 4 per group) from gestational day (GD) 35 to 135 in pregnant sheep. At GD 135, conceptus (fetal–placental unit) development was assessed; although fetal weight was unaffected (p &gt; 0.10), restricted fetuses exhibited reduced liver mass (p &lt; 0.05). Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of fetal liver identified 1,636,305 differentially methylated CpG sites (dmCpGs) in the Group-Level Analyses and 42,231 dmCpGs in the Twin-Pair Analyses.

Site-level shifts and functional enrichment across features highlighted GPCR–cAMP/calcium–PI3K/AKT signaling, phosphoinositide metabolism, ECM/integrin–focal adhesion networks, thyroid hormone signaling, and Rho-family GTPases. These findings indicate that maternal nutrient restriction modifies the fetal hepatic methylome through coordinated signaling, metabolic, and structural reconfigurations that create conditions conducive to metabolic disease.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in corporate and governmental systems has raised critical security concerns, particularly prompt injection attacks exploiting LLMs’ inability to differentiate control instructions from untrusted user inputs. This study systematically benchmarks neural network architectures for malicious prompt detection, emphasizing robustness against character-level adversarial perturbations—an aspect that remains comparatively underemphasized in the specific context of prompt-injection detection despite its established significance in general adversarial NLP. Using the Malicious Prompt Detection Dataset (MPDD) containing 39,234 labeled instances, eight architectures—Dense DNN, CNN, BiLSTM, BiGRU, Transformer, ResNet, and character-level variants of CNN and BiLSTM—were evaluated based on standard performance metrics (accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC), adversarial robustness coefficients against spacing and homoglyph perturbations, and inference latency. Results indicate that the word-level 3_Word_BiLSTM achieved the highest performance on clean samples (accuracy = 0.9681, F1 = 0.9681), whereas the Transformer exhibited lower accuracy (0.9190) and significant vulnerability to spacing attacks (adversarial robustness ρspacing=0.61). Conversely, the Character-level BiLSTM demonstrated superior resilience (ρspacing=1.0, ρhomoglyph=0.98), maintaining high accuracy (0.9599) and generalization on external datasets with only 2–4% performance decay. These findings highlight that character-level representations provide intrinsic robustness against obfuscation attacks, suggesting Char_BiLSTM as a reliable component in defense-in-depth strategies for LLM-integrated systems.",

    "Abstract": "The deployment of large language models (LLMs) in commercial environments depends critically on the availability of robust digital infrastructure, scalable computing resources, and mature cloud architectures. This study examines how macro-level digital infrastructure, in particular cloud computing adoption, conditions the ability of the European retail sector to deploy and benefit from large language models (LLMs). Using a country-year panel of EU member states from 2017 to 2023, we estimate fixed-effects regressions to quantify the association between enterprise cloud use and retail trade volume growth, and implement an event-study design to explore dynamic responses around changes in cloud uptake. The results show that increases in cloud adoption are significantly associated with higher retail trade growth added and productivity, with especially strong effects in emerging Eastern European markets. We identify a digital threshold of around 20% of enterprises using cloud services, above which the marginal impact on retail performance becomes notably larger. These findings highlight cloud infrastructure as a key enabling condition for LLM-enabled retail applications and inform EU digital and industrial policy targeting regional digital disparities.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the selection and scaling of recorded strong ground motions in the time-domain spectral matching framework to realistically represent the seismic demands on the superstructure and secondary systems in the seismic design of complex facilities such as marine ports. The time-domain spectral matching method iteratively adjusts the original record in the time domain by adding wavelets with limited durations and specific period ranges to achieve compatibility with the specified target acceleration response spectrum. A site-specific probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) was performed for a port facility in İskenderun Bay, an area affected by the 6 February 2023 earthquakes. Horizontal Ground-Motion Response Spectra (GMRS) were derived for different return periods. Based on the hazard deaggregation, recorded ground motions compatible with the seismotectonic context of the region and the site conditions were selected. These records were then processed using time-domain spectral matching (TDSM) to match their elastic response spectra with the target GMRS over specific period ranges. The method utilizes spectral matching in the time domain to improve the match with the target spectrum while preserving the phase information and non-stationary nature of the records. The results show that the mean spectral acceleration curves of the scaled records are highly consistent with the target GMRS over a wide range of periods and that near-fault pulse-like characteristics, when present, are reasonably preserved. These results confirm that time-domain spectral matching provides a reliable framework for the performance-based assessments of complex port infrastructures by achieving high compatibility with the target spectra while preserving the physical characteristics of the waveforms",

    "Abstract": "With the increasing deployment of lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) batteries in electric vehicles and energy storage systems, the recycling of these materials has become an urgent necessity. Specifically, the reclamation of lithium iron phosphate cathode materials presents a significant challenge in the recycling process. In this study, we proposed an efficient low-temperature hydrothermal direct regeneration method aimed at repairing lithium vacancies and Fe/Li inversion defects in spent lithium iron phosphate resulting from prolonged cycling. By using this method, spent lithium iron phosphate was successfully regenerated through a hydrothermal process conducted at 80 °C for 6 h, utilizing hydrazine hydrate (N2H4·H2O) as a potent reducing agent and lithium hydroxide (LiOH·H2O) as the lithium source. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, coupled with Rietveld refinement, revealed a substantial reduction in the concentration of Fe/Li anti-site defects in the spent material, decreasing from 8.8% to 3.3% following regeneration. Consequently, the electrochemical performance was significantly restored. The initial specific discharge capacity increased from 118.0 mAh·g−1 to 150.3 mAh·g−1, and the capacity retention after 100 cycles (at 1 C) improved from 67.5% to 90.7%. The hydrothermal regeneration process introduced in this work effectively repairs the material structure and restores the active valence state of iron, thereby significantly enhancing lithium-ion diffusion and electron transport capabilities. This approach constitutes a technically viable solution for the efficient, environmentally friendly, and cost-effective recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Gestational diabetes (GD) is a well known risk factor for future metabolic diseases. However, the long-term time-dependent risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remains unexplored. The aim of this meta-analysis was to quantify the long-term risk of NAFLD in women with previous GD and evaluate if the risk persists beyond the postpartum period. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed using appropriate medical subject headings to identify trials evaluating the incidence of NAFLD among women with previous GD compared to those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). Studies reporting adjusted risk estimates with a follow-up duration beyond pregnancy were included. Data were extracted and analyzed using relevant statistical methods, with the level of significance at p &lt; 0.05. Results: A total of four studies (N = 2873) were included in the meta-analysis. Women with previous GD had a 2.46-fold higher odds of NAFLD compared to those with NGT (95% CI 1.88–3.23, p &lt; 0.001). The slope for years since delivery was not significant (β = 0.001 per year, 95% CI −0.037 to 0.040, p = 0.901), indicating that the likelihood of NAFLD in women with prior GD did not change over time. Conclusions: GD is associated with a substantially increased and sustained risk of NAFLD, persisting decades beyond pregnancy. These findings identified GD as a potential early risk marker of future liver outcomes and highlight the need for long-term metabolic screening and preventive strategies for this high-risk population.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: This study aimed to investigate plasma duloxetine concentrations, factors influencing these concentrations, and the relationship between plasma levels and clinical response in patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder who were treated with duloxetine. Additionally, the study evaluated whether dose escalation resulted in proportional increases in plasma concentration and assessed the clinical utility of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) for duloxetine. Methods: In this study, plasma duloxetine levels were analyzed in 68 patients with generalized anxiety disorder who had been receiving duloxetine treatment for at least three months. A review of digital medical files revealed that duloxetine was initiated at 30 mg/day in all patients, and doses were increased to 60 or 90 mg/day in those with insufficient symptom improvement. Digital medical files indicated that participants had been on the final prescribed duloxetine dose for at least four weeks at the time of plasma level measurement. Baseline Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scores were compared with scores obtained on the day of blood sampling. Plasma duloxetine concentrations were quantified using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Associations between dose, plasma concentration, and clinical response were statistically analyzed. Results: Plasma duloxetine concentrations increased significantly following dose escalation. However, no significant correlation was observed between plasma concentrations and percentage change in HAM-A scores. Although patients receiving 60 or 90 mg/day had higher plasma levels than those maintained on 30 mg/day, clinical improvement did not differ significantly between dose groups. In addition to dose, increasing age and non-smoking status were associated with higher plasma duloxetine concentrations. Conclusions: Duloxetine demonstrates a predictable dose–concentration relationship; however, in this response-guided titration setting, plasma concentrations were not consistently associated with clinical improvement. Accordingly, these findings suggest that routine therapeutic drug monitoring may not consistently predict clinical response to duloxetine in generalized anxiety disorder; nevertheless, considering the study’s limitations, it could still offer clinically relevant insights in selected pharmacokinetically sensitive or treatment-resistant cases.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Epilepsy represents one of the most common chronic neurological disorders in children, with a considerable proportion of patients exhibiting resistance to pharmacotherapy despite the advent of novel antiseizure medications (ASMs) in recent decades. This retrospective study assesses the off-label administration of cenobamate—a newly approved antiseizure medication (ASM) for focal seizures in adults—in a cohort of paediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy at a single neurology centre. Methods: Clinical outcomes were reviewed retrospectively for 18 children who received cenobamate for at least 6 months. Results: Eighteen paediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy received cenobamate therapy at a neurology centre. The mean age was 164.6 months, and each patient had previously trialled an average of 8.7 antiseizure medications. During a follow-up period of up to 29 months, 39% of participants achieved complete seizure freedom, while five additional patients experienced a seizure reduction exceeding 80%. Concomitant clobazam use was common among the cohort. Adverse events were reported in 78% of patients, predominantly somnolence, though these were generally transient or manageable. One patient developed a temporary exacerbation of seizures, which resolved following a dosage adjustment. Many patients were able to reduce or discontinue other ASMs during the observation period. Conclusions: Cenobamate demonstrated acceptable tolerability in this paediatric cohort, and seizure improvements were observed in a subset of patients. Further clinical trials are warranted to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of cenobamate in this patient population.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) promise to enhance anatomical understanding, spatial orientation, and workflow in cardiac surgery. Their clinical adoption remains limited and the translational path is incompletely defined. Methods: A PubMed search was conducted by two independent reviewers from database inception through July 2025 and identified peer-reviewed, English-language articles describing peri- or intra-operative AR/MR applications in cardiac surgery. Relevant clinical, preclinical, technical, and review articles were selected for inclusion based on scope and content. Given the narrative approach and heterogeneity across studies, findings were synthesized qualitatively into application domains. Results: Fourteen studies were included. Five domains emerged: (1) preoperative planning and patient-specific modelling—MR enhanced spatial orientation and planning for minimally invasive and valve procedures; (2) intraoperative navigation and visualization—AR improved targeting and interpretation with preclinical overlay errors ≈ 5 mm; (3) physiological/functional guidance—thermographic AR detected ischemia in vivo with strong correlation to invasive thermometry; (4) robotic integration and workflow optimization—AR-guided port placement and stepwise robotic adoption supported the feasibility of totally endoscopic CABG; (5) AR-based early rehabilitation. Conclusions: Early clinical and preclinical evidence supports AR/MR feasibility and utility for visualization and orientation in cardiac surgery.

    "Abstract": "Background: Prepectoral breast reconstruction with an acellular dermal matrix (ADM) typically requires intraoperative manual tailoring, introducing structural variability and workflow delays. We developed the Polyhedral Matrix Configuration (PMC) technique—a geometric method for standardizing ADM shell creation—and compared it to our traditional “tear-drop” wrap to determine whether standardization improves structural integrity and operative efficiency. Methods: We reviewed all consecutive 227 patients undergoing immediate prepectoral reconstruction from January 2021 to December 2024 (tear-drop group: n = 155; PMC group: n = 72). PMC transforms planar ADM into a 3D dome using pre-designed wedge resections and butt-joint sutures, eliminating material overlap. Standardization permits back-table fabrication during mastectomy (“parallel two-team workflow”). We excluded bilateral cases for consistent operative time assessment and performed subgroup analysis to control for higher robotic mastectomy rates in the PMC cohort. Results: PMC reduced the plastic surgery time by a mean of 44.6 min (95% CI: 35.2–54.0) (p &lt; 0.001), with subgroup analysis confirming efficiency gains across both conventional (32.8 min, 95% CI: 20.1–45.5, p &lt; 0.001) and robotic mastectomies (60.8 min, 95% CI: 47.3–74.3, p &lt; 0.001). Despite zero-overlap design, PMC showed no increase in major complications (p &gt; 0.99) and lower rates of visible rippling (odds ratio 0.28, 95% CI: 0.08–0.97, p = 0.032). BREAST-Q “Satisfaction with Breasts” scores were higher in the PMC group (mean difference +7.3 points, 95% CI: 3.1–11.5, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Geometric standardization enables both design precision and operative efficiency. By separating reconstruction preparation from mastectomy through a reproducible protocol, PMC reduces the operative time while improving aesthetics through stable, single-layer construction.",

    "Abstract": "Soft tissue and intra-articular injections are common treatments for musculoskeletal disorders, especially chronic tendinopathies and osteoarthritis. In this structured narrative review, receptor-level molecular mechanisms are combined with clinical evidence from various studies for the most common injectable treatments, such as corticosteroids, hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma, and local anesthetics. When combining mechanistic pathways with the results of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, and network meta-analyses, clear differences between injectable drugs regarding rapidity of action, duration of action, systemic effects, and safety can be appreciated. Corticosteroids alleviate symptoms rapidly but with only short-term duration. Hyaluronic acid exerts longer-lasting biomechanical and anti-inflammatory effects. Platelet-rich plasma showed the most consistent long-term effect on function and regeneration. Local anesthetics remain useful for diagnostic and interventional purposes but prove harmful to cartilage after excessive administration. A mechanism- and phenotype-based framework for selecting injectables is hereby proposed, wherein treatment could be more individualized and clinical decisions could be optimized in musculoskeletal care.",

    "Abstract": "Early diagnosis and identification of causative pathogens using blood culture in patients suspected of blood stream infection (BSI) and sepsis are critical for improving patient outcomes through earlier and more targeted treatment. There is a need for tools that can guide the use of microbiologic diagnostics, especially where resources are limited, such as in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs), pandemic and mass-casualty scenarios, and prolonged field care settings during military operations. Methods: Post hoc retrospective analysis of individual patient data from three prospective clinical studies, conducted in North America, Europe and Africa, to investigate the association between SeptiCyte RAPID test results (SeptiScores) and blood culture (BC) results. Hypothesis: that a significant correlation exists between elevated SeptiScores and positive blood culture results, and between low SeptiScores and negative blood culture results. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) was 0.91 for 85 BC(+) versus 257 SIRS and was 0.80 for 164 BC(−) versus 257 SIRS. As the SeptiScore increases, the relative probability of a septic patient being BC(+) as opposed to BC(−) also increases. A non-linear positive correlation is observed. Below a crossover point at SeptiScore 10, the ratio of probabilities of BC(+) sepsis/BC(−) sepsis is &lt;1, while above the crossover point, this ratio is &gt;1. Thus, septic patients with SeptiScores &gt;10 have a higher probability of being BC(+) compared to BC(−). Conclusions: Elevated SeptiScores, obtained before blood culture results, are indicative of increased blood culture positivity. This may have clinical utility, particularly in resource-limited settings, as an aid for improving the efficiency of blood culture practice, for instance, by informing patient selection and interpretation of blood culture results.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease and the second leading cause of irreversible blindness in developed countries. It is characterized by progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and optic nerve axons, leading to permanent vision impairment. Although elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the main recognized risk factor, recent evidence suggests that ocular and gut microbiota may play a significant role in the onset and progression of glaucoma. Objectives: This study aimed to characterize ocular and gut microbiota alterations in patients with different types of glaucoma. Methods: Five searches were conducted between June and September 2025 using selected keywords. A total of 121 articles were identified, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria following the PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Results: Findings indicate a Mendelian genetic predisposition influencing microbiota composition associated with glaucoma development. Patients treated with benzalkonium chloride (BAK) showed increased Gram-negative and Alphaproteobacteria on the ocular surface, along with enhanced lipopolysaccharide synthesis. Compared with controls, glaucoma patients exhibited reduced Corynebacterium mastiditis and Actinobacteria and increased Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobiota. Dysbiosis was more pronounced in patients with concurrent dry eye disease, characterized by higher Gram-negative taxa and pro-inflammatory microbial activity. Conclusions: Significant differences in ocular and gut microbiota were observed between glaucoma patients and controls, as well as among glaucoma subtypes such as pseudoexfoliation and primary open-angle glaucoma. Age-related dysbiosis and epigenetic factors appear to contribute to disease development. Microbiota profiling may offer new opportunities for improved prediction, management, and treatment of glaucoma.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common and serious complication after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), leading to increased morbidity and healthcare utilization. Although systemic inflammation is a well-established driver of POAF pathogenesis, no composite preoperative inflammatory biomarker has been validated for risk stratification in this population. This study aimed to evaluate the novel Inflammatory Burden Index (IBI)—the first composite biomarker combining acute-phase (C-reactive protein, CRP) and chronic cellular (neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, NLR) inflammation—as a preoperative predictor of POAF after CABG. Methods: In this large retrospective cohort study, we included 3481 consecutive patients who underwent isolated CABG at a high-volume cardiac center between 2019 and 2024. Preoperative IBI was calculated as CRP (mg/dL) × NLR. The primary outcome was new-onset POAF within the first 7 postoperative days, confirmed by continuous telemetry on 12-lead ECG. Predictive performance was assessed using multivariable logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis (area under the curve, AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and internal validation via bootstrapping (1000 resamples). Results: POAF developed in 866 patients (24.9%). Patients with POAF exhibited significantly higher preoperative IBI levels (39.4 ± 18.6 vs. 26.3 ± 16.7, p &lt; 0.01). In multivariable analysis adjusted for age, hypertension, left atrial diameter, and other clinical covariates, IBI emerged as a strong independent predictor of POAF (adjusted OR 1.041, 95% CI 1.036-1.046, p &lt; 0.01). The IBI alone demonstrated moderate-to-good discriminative performance (AUC 0.72, 95% CI 0.70–0.74), significantly outperforming the Systemic Immune/Inflammation Index (SII; AUC 0.61, DeLong test p &lt; 0.001) and providing superior reclassification (NRI 0.150, IDI 0.032) and model fit (lower AIC). Combining IBI with established clinical risk factors further improved predictive accuracy (combined AUC 0.74, specificity 72.4%). Tertile-based stratification revealed a clear graded relationship with POAF incidence (low IBI: 16.6%, medium: 21.3%, high: 35.1%; p = 0.02). Notably, the medium IBI stratum (11.18-25.44) displayed the highest discriminative power (AUC 0.87, 95% CI 0.85-0.88), with bootstrap validation confirming model stability (minimal bias, robust 95% CI). Conclusions: This study establishes the preoperative Inflammatory Burden Index (IBI) as the first validated composite inflammatory biomarker independently associated with POAF following CABG. Its superior performance over existing indices (SII), graded risk stratification, and peak accuracy in the moderate inflammation window highlight its potential for personalized preoperative risk assessment and targeted perioperative intervention strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Hypertension is highly prevalent among patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), contributing significantly to cardiovascular morbidity and progressive renal decline. This overview explores the intricate pathophysiologic mechanisms driving hypertension in renal insufficiency, including volume overload, renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS) activation, sympathetic overactivity, and vascular dysfunction. Diagnostic challenges such as white-coat hypertension and the underuse of ambulatory monitoring are discussed, along with the importance of volume assessment and target organ evaluation. We also emphasize individualized management strategies combining lifestyle modification, pharmacotherapy—including RAAS inhibitors, diuretics, and novel agents—and the growing role of device-based interventions. In particular, renal denervation (RDN) has emerged as a potential adjunctive option for selected patients with resistant hypertension in CKD, with preliminary evidence suggesting blood pressure reduction in selected and carefully studied populations, including dialysis-dependent patients. Special considerations for transplant recipients, elderly individuals, and those on dialysis are highlighted, underscoring the need for nuanced, patient-centered care. Misconceptions surrounding RAAS blockade, dialysis hypotension, and therapeutic inertia are critically appraised. Finally, future directions point to biomarker-driven approaches, digital health integration, and large-scale trials on RDN to refine treatment paradigms. This comprehensive synthesis offers a pragmatic framework for clinicians managing hypertension in CKD, aligning mechanistic insights with emerging evidence and clinical realities.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is associated with metabolic and neuromuscular impairments that may influence fatigue mechanisms and limit exercise tolerance. Although previous investigations have characterized muscle performance in T1D, the peripheral fatigue threshold, defined as the maximal sustainable level of peripheral fatigue, remains poorly understood in this population. This study aimed to compare the amplitude of the maximal peripheral fatigue threshold between individuals with T1D and healthy controls to elucidate the effects of T1D on neuromuscular function. Methods: Twenty-two participants (11 with T1D and 11 healthy controls) completed two randomized experimental sessions. In each session, 60 quadriceps maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) were completed, performed for 3 s with 2 s of rest between contractions. One session was conducted under a non-fatigued control condition (CTRL), and the other followed a fatiguing neuromuscular electrical stimulation (FNMES) protocol. Central and peripheral fatigue were evaluated from the pre- to post-exercise changes in potentiated twitch force (ΔPtw) and voluntary activation (ΔVA), respectively. Critical torque (CT) was calculated as the average torque produced during the last 12 contractions, whereas the curvature constant of the torque–duration relationship (W′) was quantified as the area above CT. Results: Although both groups exhibited a decline in pre-exercise Ptw following the FNMES condition, no significant within-group differences in ΔPtw were observed between sessions (T1D: p = 0.34; controls: p = 0.23). Nevertheless, the extent of peripheral fatigue was significantly lower in participants with T1D than in controls (ΔPtw = −38 ± 11% vs. −52 ± 17%; p &lt; 0.05). Additionally, W′ values were reduced by 24% in the T1D group relative to controls during the CTRL condition (p = 0.02), and CT was significantly lower in T1D participants (262 ± 49 N) compared to controls (353 ± 71 N; p &lt; 0.01). A significant positive correlation was observed between ΔPtw and W′ across groups (r2 = 0.62, p &lt; 0.001), suggesting a mechanistic link between peripheral fatigue tolerance and work capacity. Conclusions: The present results indicate that, although individuals with T1D retain the capacity to develop peripheral fatigue, their fatigue threshold and critical torque are markedly attenuated relative to those of healthy individuals. This reduction reflects impaired neuromuscular efficiency and diminished tolerance to sustained contractile activity. The strong relationship between peripheral fatigue and work capacity underscores the contribution of peripheral mechanisms to exercise intolerance in T1D. These results enhance current understanding of fatigue physiology in diabetes and emphasize the need for tailored exercise and rehabilitation strategies to improve fatigue resistance and functional performance in this population.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is defined as the intentional damage to one’s body tissue without suicidal intent and for reasons that are not socially sanctioned. While NSSI has been widely studied in the general population, its clinical correlates and management in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) remain less clearly characterized, and it is often conflated with self-injurious behavior (SIB) described within restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs). In individuals with ASD, NSSI may be associated with emotional, behavioral, cognitive, social, medical, and demographic factors, and it differs from SIB typically observed among individuals with severe intellectual disabilities. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies published between 2000 and 2025 that assessed NSSI in individuals with a formal ASD diagnosis were included. Etiological/clinical correlates, explanatory mechanisms, and management challenges were examined. Sixteen studies were selected from PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Findings were synthesized using narrative and thematic approaches. Results: The prevalence of NSSI among individuals with ASD ranged from 24% to 50%. Associated factors included emotion dysregulation (including alexithymia and affective distress), behavioral dysregulation (e.g., impulsivity/hyperactivity and aggression), sensory processing difficulties, communication and social impairments, and medical comorbidities (i.e., gastrointestinal and sleep problems), with preliminary evidence also implicating perinatal factors. NSSI was linked to emotion regulation, sensation seeking, and social communication processes. Early intervention and parental involvement were identified as protective factors. Conclusions: NSSI in ASD is a complex, multifactorial phenomenon frequently linked to emotion-regulation needs. Affective imbalance represents a central—though not exclusive—pathway. The review supports standardized terminology, function-based assessment, and clearer differentiation from SIB/RRBs, with implications for individualized interventions and sustained monitoring in persistent or severe cases. Routine screening for medical and sensory contributors may further improve case management and reduce preventable clinical burden.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Dental anxiety is a common clinical problem that negatively affects patient cooperation, treatment acceptance, and physiological stability during dental procedures. This randomized controlled clinical trial study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of music-based interventions in reducing dental anxiety and stress responses during restorative dental treatment. The null hypothesis was that music exposure would not result in significant differences in anxiety levels or physiological stress parameters compared with standard dental care. Methods: Seventy-five patients with moderate to high pre-treatment dental anxiety (MDAS ≥10) were randomly assigned to three groups: classical music, Turkish music, and control (no music) (n = 25 per group). Anxiety levels were assessed using the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS). Restorations were performed using a standardized adhesive protocol. Physiological parameters, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), heart rate (HR), and oxygen saturation (SpO₂), as well as salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase levels, were measured before and after restorative treatment. Salivary cortisol and amylase levels were measured using a Human ELISA Kit. Statistical analysis was performed using paired t-tests and one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test (p &lt; 0.05). Results: Both music groups showed significant reductions in SBP, DBP, HR, cortisol, amylase, and MDAS scores compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Oxygen saturation increased significantly in the music groups, whereas it decreased significantly in the control group. There were no significant differences between classical and Turkish music regarding their anxiety-reducing effects. Conclusions: Music-based interventions effectively reduce dental anxiety and physiological stress during restorative dental procedures. This study is novel in simultaneously evaluating subjective anxiety scores and multiple physiological and biochemical stress markers in adult patients undergoing restorative treatment, supporting music as a simple and non-invasive adjunct in clinical dentistry.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction: Bronchiectasis is a chronic, heterogeneous airway disease characterised by irreversible bronchial dilatation, recurrent infections, and persistent inflammation, leading to progressive lung damage, frequent exacerbations, and impaired quality of life. Neutrophil-driven inflammation, largely mediated by excessive activity of neutrophil serine proteases such as neutrophil elastase, represents a central pathogenic mechanism and an important therapeutic target. Methods: Brensocatib, a first-in-class, selective, and reversible inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-1 (DPP-1), prevents the activation of neutrophil serine proteases during neutrophil maturation in the bone marrow. By reducing downstream protease activity, brensocatib modulates aberrant neutrophilic inflammation without broadly suppressing immune function. Results: Clinical studies, including the Phase-2 WILLOW trial and the Phase-3 ASPEN trial, have demonstrated that brensocatib significantly reduces exacerbation frequency, prolongs time to first exacerbation, and lowers sputum neutrophil protease activity, with a favourable safety profile. Importantly, these benefits were observed across multiple patient subgroups and in addition to standard-of-care therapies. Conclusions: As the first FDA-approved (12 August 2025) mechanism-based therapy for non–cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, brensocatib represents a paradigm shift toward targeted, precision treatment of neutrophil-mediated airway disease. Its clinical efficacy, biomarker-driven rationale, and potential to reduce antibiotic dependence highlight brensocatib as a cornerstone therapy in bronchiectasis management and a promising strategy for other neutrophil-driven inflammatory conditions.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the influence of hybrid additives and cutting parameters on the surface roughness (Ra) of drilled Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) composites. Nine composite panels were fabricated with varying concentrations of wax (0%, 1%, 2%) and graphene (0%, 0.25%, 2%). Drilling experiments were conducted on a CNC milling machine using a range of cutting velocities (50–200 m/min) and feeds (0.02–0.08 mm/rev), and the resulting surface roughness was measured using a profilometer. The results demonstrate that cutting velocity is the most dominant parameter, contributing to 69% of the variability in surface roughness, followed by feed (16%). The incorporation of additives, specifically 1 wt% wax and 0.25 wt% graphene, produced a synergistic effect, yielding the lowest average surface roughness (≈2.9 µm) and the most stable machining process. Higher cutting velocities increased roughness due to thermal effects, while increasing feeds improved surface finish by reducing frictional heating. The findings indicate that an optimal combination of moderate additive concentrations and controlled machining parameters can significantly enhance the surface integrity and process repeatability in the drilling of GFRP composites.",

    "Abstract": "Fluent word reading is a key literacy skill, yet the full extent of the oculomotor underpinnings in developing readers remains unknown. Rapid automatized naming (RAN) is a useful clinical measure that has been shown to predict word reading fluency. Here we use RAN scores to predict early, mid, and late local stages of word reading as measured by eye tracking in children who are at a critical time in their literacy development. Thirty-three children participated in two RAN tasks (rapid letter naming (RLN) and rapid digit naming (RDN)) and an eye-tracking task, which included sentence-level reading with an embedded target word. The eye-tracking measures of first fixation duration, regression path duration, and total word reading time were used as early, mid, and late local measures, respectively. RLN and RDN significantly predicted only the mid-stage of the reading process (regression path duration). Faster RLN and RDN times were associated with briefer regressions from target words. Preliminary results link behavioral RAN performance to a mid-stage oculomotor variable, indicating that children with slower RAN times may exhibit longer regressions during reading, suggesting possible difficulties with the integration of phonological processing skills.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we aimed to investigate the cognitive and affective-emotional factors underlying math achievement in a sample of 169 Japanese elementary school children. Using structural equation modeling, we examined the contributions of fluid and crystallized intelligence, verbal and spatial working memory, and affective-emotional variables, including general anxiety, test anxiety, math anxiety, and math self-efficacy. We found intelligence to be a strong positive predictor of math achievement, while among the affective-emotional variables, math self-efficacy emerged as the only significant predictor of math achievement. Interestingly, intelligence mediated the association between affective-emotional factors, such as math anxiety and self-efficacy, highlighting its central role in children’s math achievement. These findings underscore the strong relationship between intelligence and self-efficacy in educational contexts, suggesting that self-efficacy is closely linked to cognitive abilities to support children’s success in math. Educational implications are discussed, emphasizing the need to strengthen math self-efficacy alongside cognitive abilities.",

Methods: Male Wistar rats underwent incisive extraction and were randomized into three groups (n = 8/group): (1) control, (2) xenograft, and (3) icariin–xenograft. On days 7 and 14, the animals were decapitated and their mandibles were examined. Histological analysis was conducted to assess the collagen matrix and the expression of BMP-2 and HIF-1α. Results: The icariin–xenograft group exhibited superior outcomes compared to the xenograft-alone and control groups. Histological analysis showed an earlier arrangement of connective tissue and an improved collagen matrix outcome in the icariin-treated sockets. Immunohistochemistry revealed elevated BMP-2 and HIF-1α expression in the icariin–xenograft group, indicating enhanced osteogenic and angiogenic signaling. Conclusions: Icariin-enhanced xenografts speed up the repair of early extraction sockets by enhancing the development of the collagen matrix and increasing the activity of pathways that promote osteogenesis and angiogenesis in low-oxygen conditions. This bioactive grafting technology appears to be a cost-effective method for preserving sockets and performing regenerative therapy in dentistry.",

    "Abstract": "Among the vessel operation data collected worldwide, static data represent a vessel’s inherent specifications. However, due to technical limitations and environmental factors, a significant portion of these data may contain missing values. In particular, dry docking operations are fundamental process for ensuring safe navigation through vessel maintenance, and the amount of paint discharge generated during ship repairs has traditionally been estimated using static data. However, dry docking data frequently contain a high proportion of missing values, which undermines the reliability of analytical results. To address this issue, this study proposes an AI-based methodology to impute missing static data for vessels engaged in dry docking operations using the Automatic Identification System (AIS). The proposed approach employs an AI-driven imputation method based on the MissForest algorithm, applied to data collected from shipyards in South Korea. This method was used to impute key vessel attributes, including length, breadth, and draft. The reliability of the imputed data was statistically validated through comparisons with baseline models using the Mann–Whitney U test and the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. As a result, 473 missing values were successfully imputed, expanding the dataset to 1688 dry docking records.",

    "Abstract": "KANECS is a 3D multigroup neutronics code based on the Simplified Spherical Harmonics (SPN) approximation and the Continuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (CGFEM). In this work, the code is extended to solve the time-dependent neutron kinetics by implementing a fully implicit backward Euler scheme for the neutron transport equation and an implicit exponential integration for delayed neutron precursors. These schemes ensure unconditional stability and minimize temporal discretization errors, making the method suitable for fast transients. The new formulation transforms each time step into a transient fixed-source problem, which is solved efficiently using the GMRES solver with ILU preconditioning. The kinetics module is validated against established benchmark problems, including TWIGL, the C5G2 MOX benchmark, and both 2D and 3D mini-core rod-ejection transients. KANECS shows close agreement with the reference solutions from well-known neutron transport codes, with consistent accuracy in normalized power evolution, spatial power distributions, and steady-state eigenvalues. The results confirm that KANECS provides a reliable and accurate framework for solving neutron kinetics problems.",

    "Abstract": "Financial regulation assumes that parent firms reliably support distressed subsidiaries during crises. We test this assumption with evidence from the 2007–2009 financial crisis and find that parent support was selective rather than reliable. Using novel measures of sibling distress and granular parent-affiliate funding flows, our findings reveal that capital allocation within bank holding companies (BHCs) disproportionately favored stronger affiliates. The results show that BHCs channeled capital toward more liquid and resilient subsidiaries while limiting support to weaker ones. Profitable parents became increasingly selective under stress, and nonbank subsidiaries emerged as critical internal liquidity providers when external markets froze. This selective reallocation highlights a gap between regulatory doctrine and actual behavior: intra-group capital allocation mechanisms can amplify systemic stress rather than mitigate it. By examining overlooked internal market dynamics during this major financial crisis, the study offers insights for strengthening financial stability against future systemic shocks. Assessing parent firm strength alone appears insufficient. Effective crisis prevention requires supervisory frameworks that monitor sibling fragility across conglomerates, evaluate the liquidity roles of nonbank affiliates, and stress test intra-group capital flows.",

    "Abstract": "Farmland quality protection is an important measure to implement the strategy of “storing grain in the land” and a vital part of promoting ecological agriculture development. This study focuses on the main agents of farmland quality protection, farmers, with a sample of 1013 households from the rice-growing areas of Jiangxi Province, which is one of the major rice-growing provinces in southern China. We used an Ordered Probit model, a mediation effect model, and a moderation effect model to analyze the influence and mechanism of farmers’ social capital and structure on their farmland quality protection behavior. The result shows that: (1) Social capital significantly promotes the farmers’ farmland quality protection behaviors. The promoting effect of bonding social capital is greater than that of linking social capital. These conclusions remain robust after the endogeneity issue has been addressed and robustness tests have been conducted; (2) Ecological cognition plays a mediating role in this relation, while Internet use exerts a significant positive moderating effect; (3) The effect of social capital is greater for full-time farming households than for part-time farming households, and more significant for risk-neutral and risk-seeking farmers than for risk-averse farmers. Accordingly, this study proposes recommendations, including fostering farmers’ social capital, improving their ecological cognition, promoting the penetration and use of the Internet, vigorously cultivating new agricultural business entities, and expanding agricultural insurance coverage.",

    "Abstract": "Myocardial and vascular injury secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination has emerged as a clinically relevant phenomenon, with distinct but overlapping mechanisms. Myocardial injury in COVID-19 results from a complex interplay between direct viral effects and immune-mediated inflammation, supported by histopathological studies revealing macrophage-rich infiltrates, microthrombosis, and supporting fibrosis in isolated areas. In contrast, vaccine-associated myocarditis—reported predominantly following mRNA vaccines—has a self-limiting clinical course, with mechanisms likely involving molecular mimicry, aberrant immune activation, or hypersensitivity reactions, although these pathways require further validation. Although mRNA vaccines have been associated with a small increase in myocarditis, particularly in young men, the risk is significantly lower than that associated with COVID-19 infection, and the cardiovascular benefits of vaccination far outweigh these rare adverse events in most populations. After the end of the pandemic, the number of patients with severe forms of COVID-19 has decreased significantly, but we consider that cardiac involvement remains an important issue for the acute and long-term prognosis of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our paper synthesizes the latest epidemiological and mechanistic evidence on the link between COVID-19, vaccination, and myocardial and/or vascular injuries, highlighting the clinical implications and providing practical recommendations for management, as well as future perspectives on risk assessment, targeted immunotherapy, advanced diagnostic tools, and long-term monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To synthesize current evidence on the relationships between adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), stress-related mechanisms, neuroanatomical asymmetry, and mental disorders, and to propose an integrative conceptual framework describing their interaction. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted using the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. Search terms targeted the etiology and pathogenesis of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, hemispheric lateralization, stress responses, body schema disturbances, and associated mental disorders. The review was reported in accordance with PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) recommendations. A structured qualitative synthesis of 225 relevant publications was performed. Results: The analyzed studies revealed several complementary conceptual approaches to AIS pathogenesis. Emerging evidence suggests that atypical hemispheric lateralization, potentially associated with right-hemisphere (RH) dysfunction, may contribute to susceptibility to AIS. Such patterns of lateralization have been linked to specific stress-related coping strategies, including harm avoidance, as well as to disturbances of body schema and an increased prevalence of certain mental disorders. Gender-related differences in stress responses and in the development and progression of AIS were consistently reported across studies. Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that neuropsychological and stress-related mechanisms, including phenomena described as the “distorting mirror effect”, may contribute to the persistence and progression of spinal deformity in vulnerable individuals. Conclusions: AIS appears to be a multifactorial condition in which atypical neuroanatomical asymmetry, stress-related processes, and altered body representation interact. This integrative perspective generates hypotheses suggesting that prevention and treatment strategies for AIS could benefit from incorporating approaches aimed at modulating stress responses and enhancing brain neuroplasticity. Further interdisciplinary studies integrating clinical, neuroimaging, and neurobiological methods are warranted to clarify underlying mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the need for last-mile delivery systems that can navigate urban congestion while minimizing environmental impact. Hybrid truck–drone networks offer a promising solution by combining heavy-duty ground transport with aerial flexibility; however, their deployment faces significant challenges in jointly managing operational risks, energy limits, and regulatory compliance. Methods: This study proposes a hybrid matheuristic framework to solve this multi-objective problem, simultaneously minimizing transportation cost, service time, energy consumption, and operational risk. A two-phase approach combines a metaheuristic for initial truck routing with a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for optimal drone assignment and scheduling. This decomposition strikes a balance between exact optimization and computational scalability. Results: Experiments across various instance sizes (up to 100 customers) and fleet configurations demonstrate that integrating MILP enhances solution diversity and convergence compared to standalone strategies. Sensitivity analyses reveal significant impacts of drone speed and endurance on system efficiency. Conclusions: The proposed framework provides a practical decision-support tool for balancing complex trade-offs in time-sensitive, risk-constrained delivery environments, thereby contributing to more informed urban logistics planning.",

    "Abstract": "To elucidate the contact performance and friction force variation characteristics of VL seals for aviation actuators under high-pressure conditions, this study adopted a fluid–structure interaction (FSI)-coupled finite element model to analyze the maximum contact pressure and contact width and their respective variation trends across varying oil pressures and reciprocating velocities. Subsequently, friction force tests of the seals were conducted under matching operating parameters, and the friction coefficients of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) were measured and compared under different normal pressures. The results demonstrate that the friction force of the seals during both extending and retracting strokes increases with rising oil pressure, which is highly correlated with the theoretically predicted conclusion that the seal contact width expands as oil pressure increases. Further analysis confirms that reciprocating velocity exerts no significant influence on the aforementioned variation trends. This study provides a critical basis for the selection and optimal design of VL seals used in high-pressure aviation hydraulic actuators.",

    "Abstract": "The relatively poor cycle stability of zinc–air batteries (ZABs) hinders their widespread application, while self-supporting electrode materials have shown great potential in enhancing the cycling stability of ZABs. To construct a self-supporting electrode, bamboo was employed as a sustainable precursor, and a two-step pyrolysis strategy was implemented to integrate ZIF-67-derived catalysts onto a hierarchically porous carbon framework, yielding the composite material Co-N@CB. Benefiting from its structural and electronic advantages, Co-N@CB exhibits outstanding electrocatalytic performance. The overpotential for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline electrolyte is 1.5 V at 10 mA cm−2, with a potential gap (ΔE) of 0.69 V. This material is directly used as the air cathode in ZABs, delivering over 10,000 stable cycles. This excellent cycling stability arises from the strong carbon framework provided by bamboo and the enhanced electrical conductivity achieved through the pyrolytic graphitization of ZIF-67. This study paves the way for further exploration of biomass-based self-supporting electrodes toward high-performance ZABs and emerging micro/nanoscale sensing technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Unlike classical multi-layered micro-perforated panels (MPPs), which rely on sub-millimeter orifices for sound dissipation, we propose a multi-layered porous Helmholtz resonators absorber. It consists of alternately layered perforated porous material panels and perforated rigid panels with millimeter- to centimeter-scale orifices, primarily relying on porous materials for sound energy dissipation. Theoretically, perforated porous material panels are modeled as homogeneous fluid layers using double porosity theory, and the total surface impedance is derived through bottom-to-top impedance translation. A double-layered prototype was tested to validate the theoretical and numerical models, achieving near-perfect absorption peaks at 262 Hz and 774 Hz, with a subwavelength total thickness of 11 cm and a broadband absorption above an absorption coefficient of 0.7 from 202 Hz to 1076 Hz. Simulations of sound pressure, particle velocity, power dissipation, and sound intensity flow confirm that Helmholtz resonances in each layer enhance sound entry into resistive porous materials, causing absorption peaks. Parameter studies show this absorber maintains high absorption peaks across wide ranges of orifice diameters and panel thicknesses. Finally, an optimized triple-layer porous Helmholtz resonators absorber achieves an ultra-broadband absorption above a coefficient of 0.95 from 280 Hz to 1349 Hz with only 16.5 mm thickness. Compared with conventional MPPs, this design features significantly larger orifices that are easier to fabricate and less susceptible to blockage in harsh environments, offering an alternative solution for low-frequency and broadband sound absorption.",

    "Abstract": "This work reports the reuse of waste glass as a sustainable silica source for the synthesis of mesoporous silica, as an alternative to conventional silica precursors. Silica gel was produced through alkaline dissolution of glass powder using sodium hydroxide and subsequently employed as a precursor for the synthesis of porous silica. The waste-derived glass powder and the synthesized silica-based materials were characterized to assess their structural, morphological, surface, and textural properties. XRD analysis confirmed the amorphous nature of all samples, while FTIR spectra indicated successful silica network formation with modifications in bond connectivity. SEM imaging revealed spherical particles with average diameters of approximately 0.19 ± 0.02 µm for silica gel and 0.15 ± 0.03 µm for the mesoporous silica. Zeta potential measurements indicated a negative surface charge and good colloidal stability in aqueous media. Nitrogen sorption analysis revealed that the specific surface area was limited by the low solubility of silica gel in acidic media, which prevents ideal condensation on the surface of surfactant micelles. The results demonstrate that waste glass-derived silica gel is a promising precursor, although the synthesis conditions did not yield a highly ordered mesostructure, highlighting the need for further control of precursor solubility and pH.",

This review summarizes the fundamental structural configurations of 2D–polymer hybrids, including embedded composites, stacked heterostructures, covalently functionalized interfaces, polymer-encapsulated layers, and fiber–network architecture, and describes how their interfacial interactions dictate charge transport, environmental robustness, and mechanical behavior. We also highlight major fabrication strategies, such as solution dispersion, in situ polymerization, and vapor-phase deposition. Finally, we discuss emerging applications in sensors, optoelectronics, neuromorphic systems, and energy devices, demonstrating how synergistic coupling between 2D materials and functional polymers enables enhanced sensitivity, programmable electronic states, broadband photodetection, and improved electrochemical performance.

    "Abstract": "Commercial optical discs are used as low-cost grating substrates for fabricating grating-coupled surface plasmon resonance (GC-SPR) sensors, and the effects of front-side and back-side illumination are systematically compared. Three different discs were used as grating substrates with grating periods (Λ) of 322 ± 5.2 nm for BD-R, 805 ± 7.5 nm for DVD-R, and 1.582 ± 0.013 µm for CD-R. Silver (Ag) and copper (Cu) films were deposited by magnetron sputtering to form plasmonic gratings. The shallow grating height of BD-R supported continuous metal coverage, while the deeper DVD-R and CD-R grooves resulted in a less continuous layer. Plasmonic responses were measured using wavelength-modulated SPR spectroscopy and predicted with rigorous coupled wave analysis (RCWA). Ag-coated gratings produced sharper and more clearly identifiable resonances than Cu-coated gratings, which exhibited broader due to stronger damping. Front-side illumination produced stronger and more reproducible SPR excitation across all disc types, whereas back-side illumination resulted in more complex spectra as light propagates through the polycarbonate layer. Refractive index sensitivities based using Ag-coated discs of 394, 321, and 290 nm/RIU were obtained for CD-R, BD-R, and DVD-R, respectively. The results clarify the influence of fabrication strategy, illumination geometry, and disc grating geometry on resonance quality and sensitivity in low-cost optical disc-based GC-SPR sensors.",

    "Abstract": "Filled-polymer coatings enable functional surfaces for selective metallisation, wetting control and local conductivity, but pulsed-laser texturing is often limited by process non-uniformity caused by scan kinematics and plume shielding. Here, we develop a three-tier numerical workflow for nanosecond pulsed-laser surface treatment of a thermoplastic coating containing glass microspheres (baseline case: PLA matrix with Vf = 0.20; spheres represented via an effective optical transport model). Tier 1 predicts spatially resolved ablation depth under raster scanning, using an incubation law and regime switching (no-removal/melt-limited/logarithmic ablation/blow-off) coupled to a dynamic shielding factor. Tier 2 computes the 1D transient (pulse-averaged) temperature field and the thickness of the thermally softened layer. Tier 3 models post-pulse capillary redistribution of the softened layer to estimate groove reshaping. The simulations show that scan overlap and shielding dynamics dominate groove homogeneity more strongly than average power alone: under identical average power, variations in local pulse count and shielding lead to significant changes in depth statistics and regime fractions. The workflow produces quantitative maps and summary metrics (mean depth, P5–P95 range, uniformity index and regime fractions) and demonstrates how controlled reflow can smooth peaks while preserving groove depth. These results provide a predictive tool for laser parameter selection and process optimisation prior to experimental trials.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional methods for preparing rare-earth-doped TiO2 nanotubes are multi-step and often result in uneven dopant distribution, while pure TiO2 is limited by its wide bandgap and rapid charge recombination. In this study, a one-step in situ synchronous anodization strategy is developed to fabricate gadolinium (Gd)-doped TiO2 nanotube arrays directly on a titanium substrate. By adding gadolinium nitrate to an ethylene glycol–NH4F electrolyte, Gd incorporation and nanotube growth are achieved simultaneously, reducing the processing steps by over 60%. The obtained Gd–TiO2 nanotubes exhibit extended visible-light absorption with an edge beyond 500 nm and show a methylene blue degradation efficiency of 90% within 60 min, which is 50% higher than that of undoped TiO2. Scavenger experiments reveal that ·OH radicals play the predominant role in the photocatalytic process. First-principles calculations further confirm significant bandgap narrowing from 2.89 eV to 2.46 eV after Gd doping.

    "Abstract": "Recently, near-net-shape rolling has emerged as a key manufacturing technology for producing high-precision, fatigue-resistant bearing rings with irregular cross-sections, particularly for the production of Wind Turbine Shaft Bearings (WTSBs). The deformation behavior of the material during this rolling process is governed by temperature and rolling speed. Therefore, based on a thermomechanical coupled analysis, a simulation model for the deformation process of GCr15SiMn profiled rings during variable-speed rolling was developed in this study. The model was experimentally validated, confirming a dimensional error of less than 3‰. And then, the distribution of strain and temperature were analyzed during the rolling of the profiled ring. As the initial temperature increased from 1040 °C to 1160 °C, the standard deviation of strain (SDP) decreased from 6.12 to 4.05. Correspondingly, the standard deviation of temperature (SDT) was raised from 4.32 to 4.74. When the drive roll speed was increased from 2.5 rad/s to 4.0 rad/s, the SDP was reduced from 4.24 to 3.42. In addition, the SDT decreased from 4.42 to 3.21. The research indicates that SDP is primarily affected by initial temperature, whereas SDT is significantly influenced by drive roller speed. On the one hand, this study provides a clearly defined optimization framework, parameter ranges for achieving optimal uniformity in GCr15SiMn material (temperature of 1100–1130 °C, speed of 3.0–3.5 rad/s), and their anticipated benefits (an SDP reduction of 32% and an SDT reduction of 15%). On the other hand, it also establishes quantifiable industrial control targets, defining key quality assurance values (SDP ≤ 5.0, SDT ≤ 4.5). The rolling stability and precision can be improved through the selection of optimized rolling temperatures and speeds.

    "Abstract": "In this study, a novel picosecond laser ring-cut drilling method was employed to drill holes in alumina ceramics. The morphology, dimensions, taper angle, and heat-affected zone (HAZ) of the resultant micro-holes were systematically characterized under various laser processing parameters. The crystal structure, microstructure, and elemental composition of micro-holes processed under specific parameters were characterized. The results showed that the micro-hole entrance and exit dimensions and HAZ area increased with increasing spot-scanning number. However, the micro-hole taper angle initially decreased before stabilizing with an increasing spot-scanning number. Furthermore, the micro-hole entrance and exit dimensions and HAZ area gradually decreased with increasing spot-scanning speed. Conversely, the micro-hole taper angle increased with increasing spot-scanning speed. Additionally, the micro-hole entrance and exit dimensions and HAZ area gradually increased with increasing average power. However, the micro-hole taper angle gradually decreased with increasing average power. Under processing parameters of spot-scanning number N = 90, scanning speed v = 600 mm/s, and average power P = 24 W, the micro-holes exhibited a taper angle α of 4.32° and a HAZ width of approximately 0.207 mm2. In contrast to the large bright grains on the original substrate, fine grains were observed around the machining area. Compared to the original substrate surface, the percentage of oxygen atoms decreased, whereas the percentage of aluminum atoms increased at the micro-hole edge and HAZ surface. The results of this study have potential applications in the field of ceramic manufacturing.",

    "Abstract": "Airport digital transformation is commonly approached through technological integration and data-driven optimization, yet such perspectives provide limited insight into system-level reasoning and governance. This paper introduces the cognitive airport paradigm (CAP) as a mathematically grounded framework that models the airport as a domain-specific cognitive digital twin within a complex aviation ecosystem. Methodologically, the study follows a conceptual–analytical and design-science research approach, combining system analysis, conceptual modeling, ontology engineering, and formal mathematical representation of cognitive transitions and governance constraints. CAP represents airport cognition as an explicit state space characterized by cognitive maturity, governance integrity, and semantic stability. Analytical reasoning, adaptive learning, and orchestration mechanisms are formalized through instrument dominance profiles and cognitive performance functionals, enabling analytical comparison of airport configurations and identification of cognitive regimes. The results include (i) a formalization of airports as cognitive digital twins with measurable cognitive and governance properties; (ii) quantitative indices such as the cognitive readiness index, governance integrity index, and ethical alignment coefficient supporting structured evaluation of airport cognitive maturity; and (iii) illustrative expert-based parameterizations and a geometric interpretation in a cognitive simplex demonstrating that governance-oriented orchestration stabilizes airport cognition under increasing system complexity. Airport development is interpreted as continuous cognitive evolution rather than discrete stages of digitalization. The paper further proposes a cognitive roadmap for guiding airport evolution through structured cognitive rebalancing. The framework contributes to the theoretical foundations of cognitive digital twins and is transferable to other safety-critical and institutionally governed socio-technical systems.",

We establish rigidity and characterization results for nonparallel, homothetic closed CVFs under the assumption that the gradient of the scalar curvature is parallel to the CVF. It is shown that such manifolds are isometric to Euclidean space. Moreover, complete noncompact GSSs with constant scalar curvature are locally conformally flat in dimension four and have harmonic Weyl curvature in higher dimensions. Finally, we prove that these manifolds are totally umbilical if and only if their scalar curvature is constant, and they form warped products with space forms.",

    "Abstract": "The Collatz map is investigated from a nonlinear-dynamics perspective with emphasis on the structure of its iterative orbits. By embedding integers within Sharkovsky’s ordering, odd initial values are shown to be sufficient for a complete characterization of dynamics. A “direction-phase” decomposition is introduced to separate iterative orbits into upward and downward phases, yielding a family of recursive functions parameterized by the number of upward phases. This formulation reveals a logarithmic scaling relation between the total iteration count and the initial value, confirming finite-time convergence to the period-three orbit. The Collatz dynamics is further shown to be dynamically equivalent to a binary shift map, whose ergodicity implies inevitable evolution toward attractors, thereby reinforcing convergence. Numerical analysis indicates that attraction basins follow a power-law distribution and display pronounced self-similarity. Moreover, odd integers grouped by upward-phase counts are found to follow Gamma statistics. Beyond its research implications, the framework provides a concise pedagogical case study illustrating how nonlinear dynamics, symbolic dynamics, and statistical characterization can be integrated to analyze a classical discrete problem.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Objectives: Total vaginal hysterectomy (TVH) has been performed quite often for a uterus with prolapse, although less used than total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH). The purpose of this study was to compare the perioperative outcomes of patients who underwent either TVH or TAH for a uterus with a weight between 250 and 300 g and uterine prolapse (UP). Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, 180 hysterectomies were planned for women with UP between 2020 and 2024 in a tertiary center in Romania. Patients were diagnosed based on clinical symptomatology and transabdominal ultrasound. All hysterectomies were performed by the same surgeon and were divided into two groups: TVH group (n = 90) and TAH group (n = 90). Patients' characteristics like age, uterine weight, body mass index (BMI), parity, operative time, intra-operative blood loss, hospital stay, medical history, surgical history, intra- and post-operative complications, and adhesions were evaluated. Results: No significant differences were found between groups in terms of mean age, uterine weight, BMI, or parity. TVH was associated with significantly shorter operative time, lower intra-operative blood loss, and reduced hospital stay compared to TAH (p &lt; 0.001). Both medical and surgical histories were more common in the TAH group compared with the TVH group. However, post-operative complications were slightly more frequent in the TAH group (9.99% vs. 3.33%), as were adhesions (33.33% vs. 13.33%). Uterine hemisection, tactical myomectomy, or morcellation were used in most cases to obtain a reduction in uterine size for the TVH group (81.11%). Conclusions: Our results showed that shorter operating time, lower intra-operative blood loss, and reduced hospital stay support the use of TVH in the case of an enlarged uterus with UP. The present study showed that all patients requiring hysterectomy for such conditions can be offered TVH, which could represent a better therapy option.",

    "Abstract": "Childhood overweight and obesity represent a major global public health emergency, with a steadily increasing prevalence over recent decades in both developed and developing countries. Approximately one fifth of children and adolescents are overweight or obese, with marked differences across ethnic groups and geographical areas. Accurate estimation of this condition is complicated by the lack of a unique and universally accepted definition of childhood obesity, which is based on different anthropometric criteria. Although body mass index (BMI) remains the most widely used tool, growing evidence indicates that abdominal obesity, assessed by waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio, is a better predictor of cardiometabolic risk, even in children with a normal BMI. Childhood obesity is associated with several comorbidities, including arterial hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Early diagnosis and an integrated therapeutic approach are essential to reduce the risk of long-term complications. Although lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of treatment, new pharmacological options for pediatric obesity have been approved in recent years. This narrative review explores the impact of childhood obesity on the early development of hypertension, NAFLD, and OSAS, emphasizing the implications that can already be observed during childhood and adolescence. It examines the association between pediatric obesity and these conditions by synthesizing current epidemiological evidence, describing the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms linking excess adiposity to disease onset, and reviewing pediatric-specific diagnostic criteria as well as preventive and therapeutic strategies.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the thermodynamic and experimental aspects of producing a chromium–manganese ligature under high-temperature smelting conditions using low-grade iron–manganese ore and ferrosilicochrome (FeSiCr) dust as both a reducing agent and a chromium source. Thermodynamic modeling of the multicomponent Fe–Cr–Mn–Si–Al–Ca–Mg–O system was carried out using the HSC Chemistry 10 and FactSage 8.4 software packages to substantiate the temperature regime, reducing agent consumption, and conditions for the formation of a stable metal–slag system. The calculations indicated that efficient reduction of manganese oxides and formation of the metallic phase are achieved at a smelting temperature of 1600 °C with a reducing agent consumption of approximately 50 kg. Experimental smelting trials conducted in a laboratory Tammann furnace under the calculated parameters confirmed the validity of the thermodynamic predictions and demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining a concentrated chromium–manganese ligature. The resulting metallic product exhibited a high total content of alloying elements and had the following chemical composition (wt.%): Fe 35.41, Cr 41.10, Mn 8.15, and Si 4.31. SEM–EDS microstructural analysis revealed a uniform distribution of chromium and manganese within the metallic matrix, indicating stable reduction behavior and favorable melt crystallization conditions. The obtained results demonstrate the effectiveness of an integrated thermodynamic–experimental approach for producing chromium–manganese ligatures from low-grade mineral raw materials and industrial by-products and confirm the potential applicability of the proposed process for complex steel alloying.",

    "Abstract": "Accurately predicting molten steel carbon content plays a crucial role in improving productivity and energy efficiency during the Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) steelmaking process. However, current data-driven methods primarily focus on endpoint carbon content prediction, while lacking sufficient investigation into real-time curve forecasting during the blowing process, which hinders real-time closed-loop BOF control. In this article, a novel Transformer-based framework is presented for real-time carbon content prediction. The contributions include three main aspects. First, the prediction paradigm is reconstructed by converting the regression task into a sequence classification task, which demonstrates superior robustness and accuracy compared to traditional regression methods. Second, the focus is shifted from traditional endpoint-only forecasting to long-term prediction by introducing a Transformer-based model for continuous, real-time prediction of carbon content. Last, spatial–temporal feature representation is enhanced by integrating an optical flow channel with the original RGB channels, and the resulting four-channel input tensor effectively captures the dynamic characteristics of the converter mouth flame. Experimental results on an independent test dataset demonstrate favorable performance of the proposed framework in predicting carbon content trajectories. The model achieves high accuracy, reaching 84% during the critical decarburization endpoint phase where carbon content decreases from 0.0829 to 0.0440, and delivers predictions with approximately 75% of errors within ±0.05. Such performance demonstrates the practical potential for supporting intelligent BOF steelmaking.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: The stability of metabolites and lipids in feces varies depending on the storage temperature and duration. Methods: We examined the stability of various metabolites and lipids in human feces under 10 different storage conditions (room temperature for 2, 6, 24, and 48 h, 4 °C for 6, 24, and 48 h, −20 °C for 1 week, 2 weeks and 1 month) and explored markers useful for quality control of fecal samples, using metabolites and lipids that vary depending on temperature and time. Results: There was generally more variation at 4 °C than at −20 °C, and more at room temperature than at 4 °C, and variation also increased as the storage duration was extended under each temperature condition. Some metabolites and lipids were found to be unstable, even over short periods (2 or 6 h) at room temperature or 4 °C storage. However, storage at −20 °C generally maintained the stability of most of them for up to two weeks. Our results suggest that the following ratios can serve as useful quality control markers: methionine to S-methyl-5-thioadenosine, xanthine to inosine and N-linoleoyl leucine to 1,2-dilinoleoyl-sn-glycerol. Conclusions: For comprehensive metabolite and lipid analysis, we recommend promptly transferring samples to −80 °C storage, except when stored at −20 °C for no longer than two weeks, with checks on markers for quality control. When measuring specific metabolites or lipids, our catalog data can be consulted to determine acceptable storage conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Broadband piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) are attractive for powering self-sustained sensing nodes in industrial monitoring, structural health monitoring, and distributed IoT systems, where ambient vibration spectra are often uncertain, drifting, and broadband. However, tuning multiple resonant peaks in PEH arrays usually relies on time-consuming finite element (FE) parameter sweeps or iterative optimizations, which becomes a practical bottleneck when rapid, site-specific customization is required. This study presents a data-driven inverse-design framework for a five-beam PEH array based on a tandem neural network (TNN). A forward multilayer perceptron (MLP) surrogate is first trained using 10,000 COMSOL-generated samples to predict the array’s characteristic frequencies from the design variables (end masses M1–M5 and tilt angle α), achieving &gt;98% prediction accuracy with a prediction time &lt;1 s, thereby enabling efficient replacement of repeated FE evaluations during design. The trained MLP is then coupled with an inverse-design network to form the TNN, which maps target characteristic-frequency sets directly to physically feasible parameters through the learned surrogate. Multiple representative target frequency sets are demonstrated, and the TNN-generated designs are independently verified by COMSOL frequency–response simulations. The resulting arrays achieve broadband operation, with bandwidths exceeding 10 Hz. By shifting most computational cost to offline dataset generation and training, the proposed spectrum-to-parameter pathway enables near-instant parameter design and reduces reliance on exhaustive FE tuning, supporting rapid, application-specific deployment of broadband PEH arrays.",

    "Abstract": "Malignant gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and grade 4 astrocytoma, are the most common types of brain tumors in adults. Standard treatment for gliomas includes adjuvant chemotherapy, typically based on temozolomide, combined with radiotherapy. However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by the limited ability of drugs to cross the blood–brain barrier and by the hyperactivation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which drives tumor cell survival. Therefore, innovative drug combinations and novel delivery strategies are crucial for overcoming these barriers. Polymeric micelles represent a promising approach for enhancing drug delivery to brain tumors. This study aimed to obtain micelles containing cannabidiol (CBD), celecoxib (CELE), and temozolomide (TMZ), as well as their combinations, and to verify their anti-glioma properties. The study involved optimizing the micelle composition, incorporating active ingredients, and assessing the temporal stability of the resulting nanocarriers under varying temperature conditions. The GBM cell line U-138 MG and astrocytoma cell line U-87 MG were used to evaluate the biologic effects of the tested micelles. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT assay, and flow cytometry was used to analyze the effect of the micelles on apoptosis. Western blot analysis was employed to assess the impact of the tested nanoformulations on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The optimized micelles demonstrated strong cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects, accompanied by attenuation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. These preliminary findings support the therapeutic potential of polymeric micelles for treating malignant gliomas; however, further in vitro and in vivo studies are required to confirm their clinical applicability.",

    "Abstract": "The global poultry industry continues to face significant challenges due to Salmonella infections, which pose severe public health concerns and economic losses. Recently, the reemergence of antimicrobial resistance has led to the restriction of antibiotic use in poultry, especially as growth promoters, thus accelerating the search for sustainable alternatives. Among these, probiotics have gained attention as potential candidates for improving poultry health and mitigating Salmonella colonization in the gut. This review summarizes the key mechanisms through which probiotics exert anti-Salmonella effects, including competitive exclusion, production of antimicrobial substances, reinforcement of the intestinal barrier, and modulation of host immune responses. Commonly used probiotic strains in poultry such as Lactobacillus and Bacillus are discussed, alongside emerging candidates derived from non-poultry hosts that may offer additional functional benefits. Despite encouraging findings, the use of probiotics in poultry faces several challenges, including strain-specific efficacy, variation in results across studies, environmental influences, and regulatory limitations. Therefore, we further explore future directions that are aimed at improving probiotic application in poultry production, such as microbiome-guided strain selection, advanced delivery systems, and combination therapies. Advancing our understanding of probiotic-pathogen-host interactions will be essential for optimizing probiotic use to enhance poultry health, reduce zoonotic transmission of Salmonella, and contribute to safer and more sustainable food systems.",

    "Abstract": "The aetiology of invasive candidiasis is undergoing substantial changes; traditionally, these mycoses have been considered to originate from endogenous reservoirs; however, the increasing prevalence of non-Candida albicans species, such as Candida parapsilosis and Candida auris (also named Candidozyma auris), is a cause of concern as they demonstrate significant exogenous transmission. This challenges the long-standing paradigm of endogenous origin in hospital settings. Unlike previous reviews primarily focused on clinical epidemiology, this work adopts a multidisciplinary perspective combining microbiological evidence with biomaterials science. We analyse how surface roughness, hydrophobicity, and polymer composition within the hospital “plastisphere” influence Candida adhesion and the formation of dry surface biofilms (DSBs). In this specific context, in contrast to C. albicans, primarily associated with mucosal colonisation, C. auris and C. parapsilosis exhibit distinctive adaptations that promote survival in healthcare environments, including pronounced cell surface hydrophobicity and the capacity to form dense cellular aggregates, which facilitate prolonged adherence to synthetic polymers used in medical devices. We also explore the biological mechanisms underlying this resilience, with particular emphasis on the development of dry surface biofilms and viable but non-culturable states. These phenotypic traits confer tolerance to desiccation and resistance to conventional disinfectants, raising concerns that standard hygiene and decontamination protocols may be inadequate to prevent transmission. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for designing effective infection control strategies and mitigating the risk of invasive disease caused by these highly persistent species.",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluated the effects of dietary supplementation with N-Carbamylglutamate (NCG) on growth performance, immune function, intestinal metabolites, and microbiota in Danzhou chickens. In a 35-day feeding trial, a total of 480 one-day-old female chicks were randomly assigned to a control group (basal diet) and three experimental groups supplemented with 400, 800, or 1200 mg/kg NCG, with 120 chicks in each group (n = 120). The results demonstrated that NCG, particularly at 400 mg/kg, significantly improved growth parameters, including average daily gain and feed conversion ratio, while enhancing immune function by increasing serum levels of immunoglobulins (IgA, IgY) and malate dehydrogenase (p &lt; 0.05). Metabolomic analysis revealed that NCG modulated key pathways such as sphingolipid metabolism and mTOR signaling pathway, leading to significant changes in metabolites including L-arginine, ceramide, and docosahexaenoic acid (p &lt; 0.05). 16S rDNA sequencing indicated that NCG induced structural shifts in the gut microbiota, primarily affecting Bacteroidota and Firmicutes, with several bacterial genera showing strong correlations with the observed metabolic changes (p &lt; 0.05). Mechanistically, NCG promotes growth by facilitating arginine synthesis via the urea cycle and activating the mTOR signaling pathway, while its regulation of sphingolipid metabolism enhances immunomodulatory capacity. In conclusion, NCG enhances feed efficiency and immune competence by orchestrating the gut microbiota-metabolite network, demonstrating its potential for poultry production.",

    "Abstract": "Synthetic chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are widely used in agriculture to improve soil fertility and to control weeds, pests and diseases. Numerous studies have highlighted the negative effects of these chemicals on the soil environment. In contrast, during vermicomposting, earthworms generate numerous beneficial outcomes. This study aimed to screen antagonistic bacteria found after vermicomposting for their potential to inhibit the pre-emergence damping-off of tomato seedlings caused by Rhizoctonia solani. Using a dual culture method, 85 bacterial isolates were screened, three of which demonstrated antagonistic activity against R. solani. Molecular characterization based on 16S ribosomal RNA identified the bacterial isolates as Bacillus subtilis (NOAC.B77), Bacillus vallismortis (NOAC.B42), and Bacillus cereus (NOAC.B17). The strains NOAC.B77 and NOAC.B42 exhibited the most significant inhibitory effects on the mycelial growth of R. solani, with inhibition levels of 80.8% and 79.2%, respectively. In greenhouse trials, only 13% of the Inoculated, Unprotected Control tomato seedlings emerged, i.e., the R. solani inoculum caused an 87% level of preemergence damping off. In contrast, after treatment with the bacterial strains NOAC.B77 and NOAC.B42, tomato seedling emergence was not significantly different from the Uninoculated Control. These results suggest that the bacterial strains NOAC.B77 and NOAC.B42 could be commercialized as biological agents to control damping-off of tomato seedlings under greenhouse conditions.",

    "Abstract": "The liquid oxygen subcooler is a key unit for the deep cooling, storage, and transportation of liquid oxygen. Its frequent start–stop operation under liquid nitrogen bath conditions introduces potential risks to service reliability. This study employs a thermo-structural sequential coupling approach to evaluate the stress behavior of ABS components in a flat plate-fin heat exchanger during the pre-cooling, heat-exchange, and recovery stages. Based on the maximum shear stress (Tresca) criterion, the evolution of principal stresses in the brazed layer under liquid nitrogen bath conditions was analyzed, and a conservative assessment of the material’s fatigue behavior was conducted. The results indicate that the equivalent stress is governed by the third principal stress, originating from the thermal compression effect induced by low-temperature constraint shrinkage. During the heat exchange phase (2700 s), the inlet equivalent stress reached 93.49 MPa, which is below the 258 MPa limit, falling within Region 1. Local stress concentration is primarily driven by thermal loading, with brazing layer thickness, curvature radius, and liquid oxygen pressure serving as key control variables. Under a safety factor of 1.15 (107 MPa), fatigue testing exceeding 1.5 million cycles has confirmed the static safety and operational reliability of the ABS.",

    "Abstract": "Bisacurone is a sesquiterpenoid constituent of Curcuma longa that has received considerably less attention than curcuminoids despite emerging evidence of its biological activity. In this study, the anti-inflammatory potential of bisacurone isolated from the Ryudai gold variety of Curcuma longa was evaluated using an integrated in vivo and in silico approach. Acute inflammation was assessed in rats using a carrageenan-induced paw edema model, supported by histopathological examination of paw tissues. Bisacurone significantly reduced paw edema during the peak inflammatory phase and markedly attenuated dermal thickening and inflammatory cell infiltration, indicating effective suppression of acute inflammatory responses. The effects of bisacurone were comparable to that of indomethacin. To elucidate the underlying molecular basis, density functional theory calculations, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and pharmacokinetic and toxicity predictions were performed. In silico analyses revealed favorable electronic properties, drug-likeness, and stable interactions of bisacurone with key inflammatory regulators, particularly IKKβ and COX-1, along with moderate interactions with MAPKs and iNOS. Molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the stability of the protein–ligand complexes. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that bisacurone exerts anti-inflammatory effects through multi-target modulation of inflammatory signaling pathways and highlight its potential as a bioactive functional food component and a lead compound for anti-inflammatory drug development.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: After fermentation, yogurt is often supplemented with probiotics, yet sweetened with added sugars that can negatively impact cardiometabolic health. Honey provides rare sugars, oligosaccharides and phenolics that may promote gut and cardiometabolic health. We aimed to determine the impact of yogurt sweetened with commercial clover blossom honey on pro-inflammatory Th17 cytokines and microbial-derived metabolites in healthy postmenopausal women. Methods: In a randomized controlled crossover dietary intervention trial, postmenopausal women (45–65 years of age) consumed two 150 g servings of yogurt for breakfast for 4 weeks, with each serving sweetened with a tablespoon of clover blossom honey or an isocaloric amount of sugar. Blood samples were collected for the measurement of plasma lipids, bile acids (BA) and Th17 cytokines, along with fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA). The primary outcome was plasma interleukin (IL)-23. Results: Neither dietary intervention significantly changed IL-23, plasma lipids, fecal SCFA or plasma BA. Compared to sugar-sweetened yogurt, IL-33 was significantly lower after 4 weeks of honey-sweetened yogurt intake. Conclusions: In a healthy population of postmenopausal women, the daily intake for 4 weeks of honey-sweetened yogurt did not significantly impact our primary outcome of IL-23. Instead, lower plasma levels of IL-33 were observed with honey compared to sugar-sweetened yogurt intake. The impact of the intervention on this cytokine was independent of changes in fecal SCFA and plasma BA. Confirmatory studies, in a larger population with levels of honey intake within dietary recommendations for added sugar, are warranted.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Mitochondrial dysfunction, often reflected by a decline in mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) in peripheral blood cells (PMBCs), is a key hallmark of biological aging and is linked to numerous adverse health outcomes, including frailty and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D may influence mitochondrial dysfunction. This cross-sectional study aims to investigate the associations of mtDNA-CN with muscular strength, self-rated health, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25(OH)D3) levels in a community-dwelling elderly population. Methods: A total of 149 elderly outpatients (≥65 years) from Soria, Spain, were included in this cross-sectional study. Muscular strength was assessed using the hand grip strength (HGS) test, and self-rated health-related quality of life (QoL) was measured using the EuroQoL five-dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D). Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, and mtDNA-CN was quantified using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Serum 25(OH)D3, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), phosphorus, calcium, albumin and other mineral metabolism markers were measured. Statistical analyses, including Spearman correlations and multivariate logistic regression, were performed to assess associations, with stratification by sex. Results: In the total population, a marginally significant positive correlation was observed between mtDNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) and serum 25(OH)D3 levels (r = 0.210; p = 0.010), which did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. Among women, lower mtDNA-CN was significantly linked to muscle weakness (p = 0.005), mobility problems (p = 0.009), and a trend toward self-care difficulties (p = 0.016). Multivariate analysis confirmed an independent association with increased mobility impairment risk (adjusted OR = 0.983; 95% CI: 0.97–1.00; p = 0.009). No significant associations were observed between mtDNA-CN and dynapenia or QoL components in the male group. Conclusions: This study identified a marginally significant positive correlation between serum 25(OH)D3 levels and mtDNA-CN in the total population (r = 0.210; p = 0.010), which did not persist after Bonferroni correction, suggesting an exploratory link between vitamin D status and mitochondrial homeostasis in older adults. In addition, these results highlight sex-specific differences in mtDNA-CN as a potential biomarker of functional decline, particularly of mobility, in women. These findings support the idea that mtDNA-CN could serve as an integrated biomarker and that sex-specific nutrition could be used to promote healthy aging.",

    "Abstract": "Bacillus anthracis displays susceptibility to penicillin despite harboring a β-lactamase gene, a phenotype governed by the anti-sigma factor RsiP. While RsiP represses σP-dependent β-lactamase expression, its broader roles in physiology and virulence remain unclear. This study aimed to define the global regulatory functions of RsiP beyond antibiotic resistance. Deletion of rsiP significantly upregulated the nprR gene, which is an important quorum-sensing (QS) system regulator and enhanced protease secretion. The ΔrsiP mutant caused higher mortality in cellular and Galleria mellonella models and triggered elevated inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, MIP-2) in macrophages models. Surprisingly, in DBA/2 mice models, ΔrsiP was attenuated, with increased host survival and reduced bacterial loads. Competitive indices (CI) confirmed fitness defects in mice (spleen CI = 0.39; liver CI = 0.42). These defects were not due to altered oxidative stress tolerance but were attributed to impaired macrophage internalization of ΔrsiP spores, reducing early colonization. Our findings indicate that RsiP not only modulates β-lactam resistance but also influences extracellular protease activity and host adaptation.",

The intensification of these systems has been accompanied by an increased prevalence and severity of infectious diseases, which continue to constrain productivity and sustainability. Current disease management approaches include biosecurity measures, husbandry practices, therapeutics, and selective breeding, which have shown limited efficacy against many emerging pathogens affecting invertebrate species. Unlike finfish, aquatic invertebrates lack adaptive immunity and rely exclusively on innate immune mechanisms, limiting the effectiveness of traditional vaccine strategies. There is growing interest in immunostimulants that enhance innate defenses and support immune priming or trans-generational immune priming (TGIP). This review summarises the current understanding of immune defence mechanisms in molluscs and crustaceans and examines recent progress in the development of immunomodulators and prophylactic interventions aimed at improving health outcomes and disease resilience in invertebrate aquaculture.",

    "Abstract": "Pet health insurance can reduce the financial burden of veterinary care and ensure adequate treatment for companion animals. In France, where 67% of households own at least one pet and 68% of owners consider them family members, awareness of pet insurance reaches 94%, yet only around 5–6% of pets are insured. This review aims to provide an overview of the French pet health insurance market, analysing its structure, coverage options, and potential implications for veterinary practice. A literature review was conducted using French and English sources, complemented by simulated price quotes from major insurance companies for four virtual pets (two dogs and two cats). The analysis compared 11 major French pet insurance providers across criteria such as species covered, waiting periods, age limits, coverage rates, reimbursement mechanisms, and preventive care benefits. The results reveal significant variability in coverage options, preventive care allowances, and reimbursement procedures. Across providers, simulated annual premiums for the virtual pets ranged from EUR 71.76 to EUR 1426.44, with reimbursement rates of 50–100% and annual caps of EUR 763–2500. It can be concluded that pet insurance may help owners manage unexpected veterinary costs and encourage preventive care. However, subscription rates remain low due to limited understanding of insurance plans and perceived high costs. Wider adoption of pet insurance could improve access to care and ensure fair remuneration for veterinarians.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cyclophosphamide (CYC) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent and immunosuppressant drug. Former research showed that CYC induces testicular toxicity through oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. Saroglitazar (SAR) is a dual PPARα/γ agonist, used for treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia. Purpose: This study aimed to elucidate the protective impact of SAR against CYC-linked testicular toxicity. Methods: Randomly, thirty adult male rats were alienated into control group, SAR (4 mg/kg) group, CYC (200 mg/kg) group, CYC+SAR (2 mg/kg) group and CYC+SAR (4 mg/kg) group. SAR was orally administered at two doses (2 and 4 mg/kg) for 7 days. CYC was injected intraperitoneally at dose (200 mg/kg) at day 7. Results: In comparison to the CYC group, SAR at the dose of 2 and 4 mg/kg significantly increased testis weight, testicular index, sperm count, serum testosterone and serum luteinizing hormone. Additionally, SAR at both doses induced a significant reduction in testicular MDA content in addition to increased testicular levels of GSH and TAC. Furthermore, SAR markedly upregulated testicular levels of PPARγ, Nrf2 and HO-1 in addition to decreased testicular expression of NF-κB, IL-6 and TNF-α, illustrating its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effect. SAR also significantly decreased testicular expression of caspase-3 and Bax and increased Bcl2 expression, indicating its anti-apoptotic effect. Conclusions: SAR at doses (2 and 4 mg/kg) could ameliorate CYC-induced testicular injury in rats, possibly through antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effect.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Dry eye disease (DED) is characterized by tear film instability and a hyperosmolar ocular surface, which significantly impacts ocular health. Artificial tear solutions (ATSs) have been effective frontline treatments for DED, yet current commercially available products often provide only temporary relief, necessitating frequent daily administration. Significant efforts have been made to develop next-generation ATSs that can provide prolonged protective effects for DED. High-molecular-weight sodium hyaluronate (HA) is more commonly used in multi-dose preservative ATSs due to its longer chain lengths and rheological properties that can provide an enhanced retention time and clinical comfort and effects. The current methods to evaluate ATSs have largely focused on human biocompatibility and rheological testing and often overlook the dynamic nature of cellular phenotypes or the protective mechanisms at a cellular level. Therefore, this study developed novel in vitro mammalian cell assays involving human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) to comprehensively assess ATSs with HA for biocompatibility and efficacy. Methods: We evaluated cellular viability across varying severities in two distinct DED models: desiccation and hyperosmotic stress. Simultaneously, time-lapse imaging coupled with computational image analyses quantified subtle, yet significant, cellular morphological changes under these stress condition. Results: Our assays revealed that ATSs provide significant, yet varying, protection against mild, medium, and harsh desiccation stress, as well as hyperosmotic conditions. This study also made a key insight that was the observation that DED conditions induce drastic HCEC morphological changes, including significant cellular monolayer breakage, which were effectively mitigated by the ATS products used in this work. Conclusions: The assays presented here provide a robust standard for ATS testing, ultimately guiding the selection of more effective next-generation therapies and aiding in a greater understanding of DED pathogenesis.",

The analysis begins by claiming that internalism conflates three fundamental teleological aspects of sport: goals, point, and purposes. I argue that this conflation limits internalism’s ability to explain the complexity of sporting practices. By carefully distinguishing these elements, I illustrate their distinct roles in shaping sport and explore how they interact. I conclude by proposing that the alternative pluralist framework briefly sketched here enables a more comprehensive understanding of sport.",

Blue-emitting PeQDs are particularly crucial for realizing full-color displays with high color purity. This review systematically summarizes synthesis strategies for blue-emitting PeQDs and their recent advances in perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs). We first introduce the working principles of PeLEDs and detail three primary approaches to achieving blue emission through mixed-halide engineering, quasi-two-dimensional structure construction via A-site cation substitution, and quantum size effect utilization. We then review mainstream synthesis methods, including hot-injection, ligand-assisted reprecipitation, and post-synthetic anion exchange, discussing their respective advantages and limitations. Key device optimization strategies are also outlined, covering surface passivation, core–shell structures, interface engineering, and light outcoupling enhancement. Finally, we address current challenges in material stability, efficiency roll-off, and charge imbalance and provide an overview of future research directions for high-performance blue PeLEDs based on PeQDs.",

    "Abstract": "One thermodynamic parameter that is crucial to heat transport within the fluidized bed inside the rotary kiln, during clinker production, is the specific heat capacity. The particular parameter is often considered constant in the open literature, while, in reality, it strongly depends on the fluidized bed’s temperature and composition, considering that the temperature inside the kiln ranges from approx. 800 K up to 2000 K. For the current study, a mixing rule reported in the literature was applied in order to calculate the Cp of the fluidized bed, utilizing temperature and composition profiles available in the literature. An in-house code was developed for the comparison of the literature-reported Cps and those resulting from the mixing rule. It was discovered that the Cp of the fluidized bed had a proportional increase with the increase in the temperature along the length of the kiln. The deviation between the two values (calculated and literature) is relatively small in some cases, whereas, in others, it is quite significant, ranging from 1.56% to 52.49%, thus making the adoption of the temperature-dependence of Cp necessary. Establishing a more accurate relation for the specific heat capacity leads to a better energy balance inside the kiln, which, along with other improvements, can lead to a decrease in the energy consumed and a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.",

    "Abstract": "The enhanced performance of electrokinetics (EK) on the cadmium (Cd) dissociation, redistribution, and phytoremediation of Cd-contaminated agricultural soil has been investigated based on the application of an electric field in different dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D). In electrokinetic–assisted phytoremediation (EKPR), unlike the uniform pH change observed in 1D treatment, more soil points (P1–P9) under 2D/3D electric fields were exposed to the influence of the anode (or cathode during polarity switching). Sedum plumbizincicola mitigates EK-induced soil acidification and alkalization, particularly anode acidification under high voltage (10–20 V). Studies reveal that EK promotes Cd dissolution into soil pore water, with a 227.82% maximum increase in the anode region under EK2 treatment of 10 V voltage, facilitating Cd phytoextraction. Periodically reversed DC electric fields enhanced Sedum plumbizincicola height more significantly than biomass, with no conspicuous regional differences. Overall, EKPR (voltage of 5–10 V) can effectively promote soil Cd phytoremediation due to the synergistic effect of direct interface action and indirect influence of the electric field to improve the Cd speciation evolution, dissociation, and bioavailability at the soil–water interface. The appropriate electric field arrangement and voltage were 2D treatment (EKPR2) and 5 V for S. plumbizincicola, respectively. In this case, the average Cd removal rate was as high as 50.23%, and the biomass and Cd accumulation increased by 16.59% and 29.31%. This suggests that plant growth constitutes the pivotal stage driving Cd accumulation and ultimately achieving Cd removal from soil, which is the key to enhancing remediation efficiency. Meanwhile, the configuration and intensity regulation of electric fields, as core elements ensuring the enhanced efficacy of electrokinetic–assisted phytoremediation (EKPR), can indirectly affect plant growth and Cd accumulation processes by modulating intermediate variables such as soil pH, nutrient status, and heavy metal speciation evolution.",

    "Abstract": "Efficient resource allocation during fruit expansion and ripening is critical for enhancing mango (Mangifera indica L.) productivity and fruit quality. A study was conducted to quantify the effects of foliar-applied GA3 at concentrations of 0 (control), 50 (GA50), 100 (GA100) and 200 (GA200) mg L−1, applied at 15, 25 and 35 days after full bloom, on fruit physiochemical attributes during the fruit expansion and ripening phases. In addition, metabolic profiling and pathway analysis were conducted after fruit ripening. Compared with the control, GA3 application at 50, 100, and 200 mg L−1 increased fruit length by 8, 12, and 14%, and fruit diameter by 5, 11, and 14%, respectively. The mean single-fruit weight was increased by 5–11% at physiological maturity. During the fruit expansion phase, GA3 treatment decreased starch and total acidity by up to 11% and 29%, respectively, while increasing the soluble sugar content by 21%. Furthermore, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, POD, and CAT), accompanied by a reduction in malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in leaves, were observed. At the ripening stage, GA3-treated fruits exhibited lower weight loss, higher firmness, more uniform color development, and reduced disease incidence, although vitamin C content and total soluble solids declined. PCA analysis identified GA100 as the optimal treatment. Metabolomics analysis revealed 287 differentially regulated metabolites between GA100 and the control. Sweet, fruity, and floral compounds were upregulated, whereas terpenoids and aldehydes were downregulated. KEGG pathway analysis indicated that GA100 modulated key resource-related metabolic pathways, including nitrogen, carbon and energy metabolism, thereby promoting efficient resource allocation toward fruit growth, quality, and aroma development. Overall, preharvest foliar application of GA3, particularly at a concentration of 100 mg L−1 (GA100), markedly improved mango fruit growth and quality but tended to simplify the aroma profiles by favoring ester production over complex terpenoid-derived notes.",

    "Abstract": "Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) has a propensity to accumulate cadmium (Cd), especially in its leaves, which can have a detrimental impact on yield, quality, and product safety. The development of low-accumulation cultivars is a vital mitigation approach; however, the underlying mechanisms remain inadequately understood. In this study, through pot experiments, the physiological mechanisms responsible for the differential Cd accumulation between the low-accumulating tobacco line CF986 and the high-accumulating Yuyan5 were explored. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the organ-specific Cd distribution, chemical speciation, subcellular compartmentalization, and photosynthetic responses across a gradient of Cd exposure. In comparison with Yuyan5, CF986 accumulated significantly higher amounts of Cd in the roots and stems, but substantially lower amounts in the leaves. Specifically, the Cd content in the leaves of CF986 was only 64.32–68.74% of that in Yuyan5 across different Cd exposure levels. The organ-specific Cd distribution pattern in CF986 followed the order: leaf &gt; stem &gt; root. Moreover, the proportion of Cd partitioned to the leaves was lower in CF986 compared to Yuyan5, while the roots and stems exhibited enhanced Cd retention, with Cd levels in stems reaching up to 2.04 times higher than those in Yuyan5. Analysis of the chemical forms and subcellular distribution of Cd indicated that the mobile Cd fractions in the stems of CF986 were significantly reduced compared to Yuyan5. A larger proportion of Cd was immobilized in the stem cell-wall fraction, which enhanced Cd retention and restricted xylem-mediated transport to the leaves. Cd exposure did not significantly affect the concentration of foliar photosynthetic pigments in CF986; however, it notably inhibited the activity of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center. At higher Cd levels, the photoprotective thermal dissipation gradually failed, with a decrease of up to 41.36% in ΦNO for CF986 compared to CK under Cd4.0 treatment. This research unveiled a stem barrier mechanism, whereby Cd translocation to the leaves is restricted through chemical and subcellular sequestration in the stem. This mechanism provides a novel perspective on both plant heavy metal allocation and the assurance of crop safety.",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates 10 bar water aging effects on reciprocating tribology of FDM-printed PLA and PLA with 10 and 15 wt.% glass fiber (GF). Water uptake was Fickian, and saturation mass rose from 0.0845 g (PLA) to 0.1625 g and 0.295 g (10 and 15 wt.% GF). Reciprocating tests at 40 N over 100 m at 0.5 and 1 Hz showed immersion time drives coefficient of friction (COF) and wear. At 0.5 Hz, neat PLA stabilized at COF 0.65 to 0.70 but increased to about 0.75 to 0.80 after 7-day; PLA + 10 wt.% GF reached about 0.80 to 0.82 after 14-day to 28-day. GF reduced unaged wear depth from about 125 µm to about 85 to 96 µm, yet 28-day aging increased depths to about 129 to 132 µm for both GF levels at 0.5 Hz. At 1 Hz, neat PLA peaked at about 235 to 240 µm depth after 7-day, whereas 15 wt.% GF reached about 160 µm after 28-day. Factorial analysis showed that wear scar width was primarily influenced by immersion time, accounting for 76.02% of the variation in the data, clearly evidencing strong dependence on the environment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), glass transition temperature (Tg), and the melting temperature (Tm) support the occurrence of a transition from volume to interface-dominated damage with aging, while Tg and Tm remain unaffected.",

    "Abstract": "Natural fabrics such as cotton and silk have been widely used due to their excellent properties, but their tendency to wrinkle limits their value. Traditional anti-wrinkle finishing agents suffer from issues like formaldehyde release and performance imbalance. This paper reviews the advances in anti-wrinkle finishing of cotton and silk fabrics, analyzing from the perspectives of environmentally friendly finishing agents, physical properties balancing, sustainable anti-wrinkle finishing, and synchronized multi-functionality. Current research have developed various environmentally friendly formaldehyde-free finishing agents, such as carboxylated polyaldehyde sucrose and α-lipoic acid, through strategies including natural product modification and organic–inorganic hybridization. The application of these agents can enable fabrics to achieve a balance between wrinkle resistance, mechanical properties, hydrophilicity, and resistance to yellowing properties. Simultaneously, they also overcome the limitations of traditional processes, endow fabric with integrated application of wrinkle resistance alongside functions such as dyeing, flame retardancy, and antibacterial properties. Moreover, optimization methods such as response surface methodology (RSM) have facilitated the precise regulation of process parameters. Future research should continue to focus on greenization, high performance, and multi-functional coordination, deepen molecular design and process optimization, and provide support for the sustainable development of the textile industry.",

    "Abstract": "Conventional mixed-flow pump designs are typically developed under the assumption of uniform inflow. However, due to various operational constraints, these pumps often operate under non-uniform inflow conditions, which can significantly deteriorate hydraulic performance and operational stability. To investigate the influence of inflow conditions on parameter analysis and optimization results of mixed-flow pumps, this study conducted optimization design under both uniform and non-uniform inflow conditions. Four loading control parameters—LE (leading-edge preloading), K (slope of the intermediate linear segment), and NC and ND (first and second loading inflection positions)—were selected as design parameters, while the weighted hydraulic efficiency at 0.8Qdes, 1.0Qdes, and 1.2Qdes served as the optimization objective. Under uniform inflow conditions, the sensitivity ranking of the parameters for efficiency (subscripts s and h denote shroud and hub, respectively) is: LEs &gt; Kh &gt; LEh &gt; NDh &gt; NCh &gt; Ks &gt; NCs &gt; NDs. The corresponding optimal parameter values are −0.2, 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.25, 1.5, 0.1, and 0.6. Under non-uniform inflow, the ranking changes markedly to: NCh &gt; LEs &gt; Kh &gt; Ks &gt; NDh&gt; LEh &gt; NDs &gt; NCs, with optimal values of 0.4, 0, 1.5, 0, 0.6, −0.2, 0.8, and 0.1, respectively. Compared with the baseline model, the optimized configurations achieve efficiency improvements of 0.61%, 2.94%, and 3.74% under uniform inflow, and 0.23%, 4.42%, and 6.78% under non-uniform inflow. Analysis of the internal flow field indicates that incorporating inflow conditions at the initial design stage significantly enhances the robustness of the optimized blade geometry when subjected to non-uniform inflow. These findings provide important implications for the optimization and practical design of mixed-flow pumps operating under complex inflow environments.",

    "Abstract": "The success of acid stimulation in tight carbonate reservoirs relies on the formation of non-uniform etching on fracture walls. However, existing research on the influence of the fracture surface morphology on non-uniform etching and fracture conductivity predominantly employed non-replicable tensile fracture surfaces. Previous studies were unable to use identical fracture surfaces to conduct single-factor analysis and clarify the impact of roughness. This study utilized digital engraving technology to fabricate multiple artificial carbonate rock samples with a homogeneous lithology and completely consistent fracture surface morphology. Using the Triangular Prism Method (TPM), the initial fracture roughness of the rock samples was decomposed into large-scale waviness and small-scale unevenness. Through controlled injection parameters, single-factor acid etching experiments were conducted. For the first time, the effects of large-scale waviness and small-scale unevenness on acid etching were investigated, along with the influences of the acid injection rate and injection time. The existence of an optimal injection rate and an optimal injection time was clarified. The results demonstrate that the engraved carbonate samples’ surfaces exhibit good consistency with the original natural fracture surfaces. The acid solution acts to shave the “peaks” and deepen the “valleys” of rough fractures. The large-scale waviness characteristics of the initial rough surfaces determine the overall post-etching morphology, leading to poor surface contact within the fracture. This is the primary reason for the high fluid flow capacity of acid-etched fractures under low closure stresses. However, the small-scale unevenness characteristics of the initial rough surfaces determine the formation and the distribution of small protruding support points on the post-etching surface. This is the primary reason for the retention of high conductivity in acid-etched fractures under high closure stresses. An increase in the acid injection rate or acid injection time does not lead to a linear decrease in linear roughness, surface mismatch, or fracture aperture. A critical acid injection rate or critical acid injection time exists. Optimizing the injection rate or time can achieve an ideal etching morphology—the protrusions formed by punctate etching enable the fractures to maintain a certain level of conductivity even under a high closure stress of 55.2 MPa, while channel etching can increase the conductivity under high closure stress by 20–25%, providing a key direction for optimizing acid etching effects.",

    "Abstract": "To address the stringent insulation safety requirements of modern high-voltage transformers, accurately characterizing the transient electric field is critical. However, a significant problem remains: current engineering models typically rely on static capacitive distributions, failing to capture the dynamic electric field distortion induced by rapid space charge injection under lightning impulses. Therefore, a non-contact spatial electric field measurement method based on the optical Kerr effect was employed to analyze the influence of electrode material, voltage amplitude, and wavefront time. Unlike traditional simulation models that often assume constant mobility and focus solely on the shielding effect, this study reveals a non-monotonic electric field evolution driven by a ‘Static-Dynamic’ mode transition. The proposed model highlights two critical breakthroughs: (1) Mechanism Innovation: It experimentally verifies that charge injection is governed by the ion charge-to-mass ratio rather than just the work function, leading to a newly identified field enhancement phase during the wavefront that overcomes the limitations of capacitive models that underestimate transient stress. (2) Parameter Quantification: Precise spatiotemporal thresholds are established—negative charges traverse the gap within ~200 ns, while positive charges require ~10 μs to reach equilibrium. These findings provide experimentally calibrated time constants for simulation correction and offer new criteria for optimizing electrode materials in UHV transformers to mitigate transient field distortion.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Management of Mental Health Care Users is a critical component of the overall health care system, yet it is not given the serious attention it deserves due to stigma and discrimination against those living with mental health challenges. These results in mental health care users being readmitted to the hospital frequently, despite the poor resources and overburdened health care system. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore and describe the experiences of Psychiatric Nurses regarding the care of Mental Health Care Users in the selected hospitals in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Methods: A qualitative study was followed, where explorative, descriptive, and contextual designs were used. The researcher purposefully selected thirty-four Psychiatric Nurses who have been working in mental health units. Data was collected through unstructured interviews. Thematic analysis was utilized to analyze the data. Results: The study revealed significant challenges, such as poor mental health structures or no mental health unit at all, and this forces Psychiatric Nurses to mix critically ill medical patients with psychotic patients. Furthermore, there is a shortage of staff and treatment to manage users. Conclusions: In conclusion, the study showed that psychiatric nurses face serious emotional and resource-related challenges in caring for mental health care users. This highlights the urgent need for support from institutions, ongoing training, and better working conditions to improve the quality of mental health care. The success of the care, treatment, and rehabilitation of mental health care users depends on the support of MHCUs by family and management.",

    "Abstract": "By its availability and deposition dust is a key indicator for past climate variability. Due to the location in the main North African dust corridor, the Canary Islands preserve dust deposits in different geoarchives—for instance in valleys dammed by Quaternary volcanism. These basins act as sediment traps for aeolian, volcanic, and slope-derived material, forming alternating pale, carbonate-enriched (PCLs) and reddish, clay-enriched layers (RCLs). However, the extent to which these sequences retain primary dust signals remains uncertain. We examine the interpretability of locally called vega sediments by disentangling input pathways, post-depositional processes, and geomorphological controls. Two sections on Lanzarote (Teguise, Femés) and the section Vallebrón (Fuerteventura) were investigated using grain-size analysis, XRF and XRD measurements, and IRSL dating. The sequences reveal two dust components: high-intensity dust fall events forming PCLs, and persistent finer dust input preserved in RCLs through kaolinite. Many PCLs originated as loess-like deposits subsequently modified by carbonate redistribution, while clay mineral transformations complicate provenance interpretation. Archive clarity varies with geomorphology, from less distinctly layered, patchy carbonate-enriched succession at Vallebrón to continuous cyclic sequences in Teguise. Overall, these basins preserve both episodic dust events and continuous fine-grained input, offering a valuable framework for reconstructing Late Quaternary dust dynamics.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Clinical Significance: Pediatric autoimmune gastritis (AIG) is a rare and frequently underdiagnosed disorder characterized by chronic immune-mediated inflammation and atrophy of the gastric mucosa. In children, AIG typically presents with iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) refractory to oral iron supplementation, in contrast to the pernicious anemia more commonly observed in adults. Diagnosis relies on a combination of serological markers, such as anti-parietal cell antibodies, and histopathological confirmation, with gastric biopsies demonstrating oxyntic mucosal atrophy and lymphocytic infiltration. Early recognition is essential, particularly in patients with personal or familial autoimmune backgrounds, to prevent long-term complications including nutritional deficiencies and increased gastric neoplasia risk. Case Presentation: An 11-year-old boy was referred for evaluation of severe microcytic anemia. He was clinically asymptomatic, with normal growth and physical examination except for mucocutaneous pallor. Celiac disease, thyroid dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, and infectious or inflammatory gastrointestinal causes were excluded. Despite six months of high-dose oral iron therapy, anemia persisted. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed macroscopically normal mucosa; however, histopathological analysis of gastric body biopsies revealed chronic atrophic gastritis. Serological testing confirmed autoimmune etiology, with positive anti-parietal cell antibodies and hypergastrinemia. Since diagnosis, the patient has required two courses of intravenous iron supplementation, and remains under close follow-up for associated autoimmune and hematologic conditions. Conclusions: Refractory IDA may represent the sole clinical manifestation of AIG in pediatric patients, even in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Histological assessment is crucial, as endoscopic findings may be normal. Early diagnostic suspicion allows timely management focused on correction of nutritional deficiencies and long-term surveillance to mitigate neoplastic risk. AIG should therefore be considered in children with anemia unresponsive to conventional iron therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Autoinflammatory bone disorders are rare, non-infectious inflammatory conditions that primarily involve the skeleton, most commonly presenting as chronic nonbacterial osteomyelitis (CNO) or chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO). Less frequently, they occur in the context of Mendelian syndromes such as Majeed syndrome, deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA), and pyogenic arthritis; pyoderma gangrenosum; and acne (PAPA) syndrome. Given the role of IL-1-driven innate immune dysregulation across these bone disorders, and the growing, though heterogeneous, clinical experience with IL-1 blockade, this review maps and critically appraises the available evidence on canakinumab in autoinflammatory bone disorders. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed and the Cochrane Library (English, inception–July 2025) and screened ClinicalTrials.gov. Eligible reports included any case reports/series describing canakinumab use in autoinflammatory bone disorders (CNO/CRMO, Majeed, DIRA, PAPA). Results: Six publications met the inclusion criteria (one case series, five case reports; 10 patients). Complete responses were reported in all three patients with Majeed syndrome and in two patients with sporadic CRMO associated with systemic features. Partial responses occurred in two additional sporadic CRMO cases, while no meaningful response was documented in DIRA. No interventional trials of canakinumab were identified on ClinicalTrials.gov for CNO/CRMO, Majeed, DIRA, or PAPA. Conclusions: Although the role of IL-1 in the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory bone disease provides a rationale for IL-1 blockade, evidence for canakinumab remains limited and heterogeneous, precluding definitive conclusions. Indicators of benefits appear most consistently in Majeed syndrome and in selected CRMO phenotypes.",

    "Abstract": "Eutrophication is a form of pollution caused by elevated nutrient concentrations in water bodies, leading to excessive algal growth and subsequent oxygen depletion. This process poses significant risks to aquatic ecosystems and overall water quality. This study investigates the spatial distribution of eutrophication in the Almyros Stream, aiming to develop a rapid and high-resolution approach for identifying eutrophication patterns and selecting representative sampling sites. Almyros is an urban stream in the western Heraklion Basin (Crete, Greece) that is subjected to considerable pressures from agricultural, industrial, urban, and tourism-related activities. Data for this study were collected using a drone equipped with a multispectral sensor. The multispectral bands, together with remote sensing indices associated with chlorophyll presence, served as input data. Chlorophyll presence is a key indicator of phytoplankton biomass and is widely used as a proxy for nutrient enrichment and eutrophication intensity in aquatic ecosystems. The k-means clustering algorithm was then applied to classify the data and reveal the eutrophication spatial patterns of the study area. The results show that the methodology successfully identified spatial variations in eutrophication-related conditions and generated robust eutrophication pattern maps. These findings underscore the potential of integrating remote sensing and machine learning techniques for efficient monitoring and management of water bodies.",

    "Abstract": "The widespread adoption of camera trap surveys for wildlife monitoring has generated a substantial volume of ecological data, yet processing constraints persist due to the time-consuming process of manual image classification and the reliability of automated systems. This study assesses the performance of Conservation AI’s UK Mammals model in classifying three species—Western European hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus), red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), and European badgers (Meles meles)—from a subsample of 234 records from camera trap images collected through a citizen science initiative across residential gardens. This analysis was repeated after retraining the model to assess improvement in model performance. Initial model outputs demonstrated high precision (&gt;0.80) for foxes and hedgehogs but low recall (&lt;0.50) for hedgehogs, with the lowest recall probability of 0.12 at the 95% confidence threshold (CT). Following retraining, model performance improved substantially across all metrics, with average F1-scores (weighted average of precision and recall across the three species tested) improving at all CTs, though discrepancies with human classifications remained statistically significant. Based on performance results from this study, we present a semi-automated, three-step workflow incorporating an artificially intelligent (AI) generalist object detector (MegaDetector), an AI species-specific classifier (Conservation AI), and manual validation. Where privacy concerns restrict citizen science contributions, our pipeline offers an alternative that accelerates camera trap data analysis whilst maintaining classification accuracy. The findings provide baseline performance estimates of Conservation AI’s UK Mammals model and present an approach that offers a practical solution to improve the efficiency of using camera traps in ecological research and conservation planning. We also highlight the importance of continuous AI model training, the value of citizen science in expanding training datasets, and the need for adaptable workflows in camera trap studies.",

    "Abstract": "Disentangling the impacts of ecological restoration from climate change is an ongoing challenge in remote sensing since the traditional correlative approaches often cannot elucidate causal mechanisms. To overcome this, we introduce a Causal Remote Sensing Framework that uses multi-source satellite data (2000–2020), machine learning (XGBoost, SHAP) and causal inference (T-Learner) to build pixel-level counterfactuals. Using this framework, we assessed the Return Grazing to Grassland Program (RGGP) on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. Our results demonstrate that a warming and wetting climate improved Water yield (WY) while at the same time decreasing sand fixation (SF) in 83.6% of the region. Notably, the restoration project became the main factor that slowed this decline. After controlling for observational selection bias, the program had a net positive effect of (+6.02 t hm−2), reducing degradation in 64.6% of treated areas. This framework provides a practical way for the remote sensing community to go beyond change monitoring to allow the diagnosis of the causal mechanisms in complex human-environment systems.",

    "Abstract": "This work proposes a novel tree detection methodology, named DTCD (Distance Transform Circle Detection), based on a fast circle detection method via Distance Transform and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) optimization. More specifically, a visible-band vegetation index (RGBVI) is calculated to enhance canopy regions, followed by morphological filtering to delineate individual tree crowns. The Euclidean Distance Transform is then applied, and the local maxima of the smoothed distance map are extracted as candidate tree locations. The final detections are iteratively refined using the AIC to optimize the number of trees with respect to canopy coverage efficiency. Additionally, this work introduces DTCD-PC, a modified algorithm tailored for point clouds, which significantly enhances detection accuracy in complex environments. This work makes a significant contribution to tree detection in the following ways: (1) by creating a tree detection framework entirely based on an unsupervised technique, which outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and supervised tree detection methods; (2) by introducing a new urban dataset, named AgiosNikolaos-3, that consists of orthomosaics and photogrammetrically reconstructed 3D point clouds, allowing the assessment of the proposed method in complex urban environments. The proposed DTCD approach was evaluated on the Acacia-6 dataset, consisting of UAV images of six-month-old Acacia trees in Southeast Asia, demonstrating superior detection performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques, both unsupervised and supervised. Additional experiments were conducted in the custom-developed Urban Dataset, confirming the robustness and generalizability of the DTCD-PC method in heterogeneous environments.",

    "Abstract": "As a key technology in the intelligent interpretation of remote sensing, remote sensing image change detection aims to automatically identify surface changes from images of the same area acquired at different times. Although vision foundation models have demonstrated outstanding capabilities in image feature representation, their inherent patch-based processing and global attention mechanisms limit their effectiveness in perceiving multi-scale targets. To address this, we propose a multi-scale remote sensing image change detection network based on a vision foundation model, termed SAM-MSCD. This network integrates an efficient parameter fine-tuning strategy with a cross-temporal multi-scale feature fusion mechanism, significantly improving change perception accuracy in complex scenarios. Specifically, the Low-Rank Adaptation mechanism is adopted for parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) image encoder, adapting it for the remote sensing change detection task. A bi-temporal feature interaction module(BIM) is designed to enhance the semantic alignment and the modeling of change relationships between feature maps from different time phases. Furthermore, a change feature enhancement module (CFEM) is proposed to fuse and highlight differential information from different levels, achieving precise capture of multi-scale changes. Comprehensive experimental results on four public remote sensing change detection datasets, namely LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, NJDS, and MSRS-CD, demonstrate that SAM-MSCD surpasses current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several key evaluation metrics, including the F1-score and Intersection over Union(IoU), indicating its broad prospects for practical application.",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates the performance of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies for wetland classification in the province of Alberta, Canada, using integrated remote sensing inputs, including airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR), orthophotography, and multi-sensor satellite imagery (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, PlanetScope). Our primary objective was to assess whether AI-driven modelling approaches, specifically machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), can meet Alberta’s provincial wetland mapping standards. We hypothesized that integrating high-resolution LiDAR with multi-seasonal optical and radar data composites into advanced AI algorithms would achieve the required classification accuracy, detail, and minimum mapping unit targets. We tested several methodologies in four ecologically distinct pilot areas representing Alberta’s Boreal, Grassland, and Parkland Natural Regions. AI models included ensemble ML using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest, and a DL U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN). AI models were trained on expert-labelled photoplots and validated using in situ field surveys. Our findings demonstrate that both ML and DL models met and, in several cases, exceeded the provincial mapping standards with validation overall accuracies surpassing &gt;70% (form), &gt;80% (class), and &gt;90% (wetland–upland). U-Net CNN models generally produced the highest overall accuracies and most precise wetland extent delineation, but XGBoost offered finer detail and granularity for detailed mapping of rare wetland forms. Integrating LiDAR data and derivatives further enhanced model performance, improving accuracy by as much as 13%. Based on these outcomes, we provide a set of recommendations for scaling up these approaches, focusing on model selection, LiDAR imagery integration, and the continued value of field surveys to support the operational scaling of AI-driven classification approaches for wetland inventory updates across Alberta’s diverse landscapes. However, key challenges remain in scaling up this approach due to the cost of acquiring high-resolution LiDAR and satellite imagery.",

    "Abstract": "Bio-inspired flow-sensing and actuation mechanisms offer a promising path for enhancing the stability of flapping-wing flying robots (FWFRs) operating in dynamic and noisy environments. This study introduces a bio-inspired sensing and actuation feather unit (SAFU) that mimics the covert feathers of falcons and serves simultaneously as a distributed flow sensor and an adaptive actuation element. Each electromechanical feather (EF) passively detects airflow disturbances through deflection and actively modulates its flaps through an embedded actuator, enabling real-time aerodynamic adaptation. A reduced-order bond-graph model capturing the coupled aero-electromechanical dynamics of the FWFR wing and SAFU is developed to provide a physics-based training environment for a proximal policy optimization (PPO) based reinforcement learning controller. Through closed-loop interaction with this environment, the PPO policy autonomously learns control actions that regulate feather displacement, reduce airflow-induced loads, and improve dynamic stability without predefined control laws. Simulation results show that the PPO-driven SAFU achieves fast, well-damped responses with rise times below 0.5 s, settling times under 1.4 s, near-zero steady-state error across varying gust conditions and up to 50% alleviation of airflow-induced disturbance effects. Overall, this work highlights the potential of bio-inspired sensing-actuation architectures, combined with reinforcement learning, to serve as a promising solution for future flapping-wing drone designs, enabling enhanced resilience, autonomous flow adaptation, and intelligent aerodynamic control during operations in gusts.",

The device exploits the linear relationship between the dielectric constant of a binary mixed solution and its concentration, mapping concentration information to absorption frequency shifts with a sensitivity of 28.53 GHz/RIU. System modeling was performed through full-wave simulation. Experimental results demonstrate a highly linear relationship between resonance frequency shift and concentration across ethanol, water, and ethanol–water solutions. The relative deviation between simulation and measurement is less than 3%, validating the model’s reliability and the robustness of the detection principle. This detector supports rapid non-contact sample replacement without requiring chemical labeling or specialized packaging. It can be mass-produced on standard PDMS substrates, with each unit reusable for &gt;50 cycles. With a single measurement time of &lt;30 s, it meets high-throughput detection demands. Featuring low power consumption, high precision, and scalability, this device holds broad application prospects in point-of-care diagnostics, online process monitoring, and resource-constrained scenarios.

    "Abstract": "Microwave imaging (MWI) is a non-invasive technique for visualizing the anomalies of biological tissues. The imaging process is accomplished by comparing the electrical parameters of healthy tissues and malignant tissues. This work introduces a microwave imaging system for tumor detection in breast tissue. The experiment is performed in a homogeneous background medium, where a high dielectric contrast material is used to mimic the tumor. The proposed imaging system is experimentally evaluated for multiple tumor locations and sizes using a horn antenna. Reflection coefficients obtained from the monostatic configuration of the horn antenna are used for image reconstruction. The evaluation metrics, such as localization error, absolute area error, DICE score, Intersection over Union (IoU), precision, accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, are computed from the reconstructed image. A modified version of the beamforming algorithm improves the quality of reconstructed images by providing a minimum accuracy of 96% for all test cases, with an evaluation time of less than 48 s. The proposed methodology shows promising results under a controlled environment and can be implemented for clinical applications after adequate biological studies. This methodology can be used to calibrate any antenna system or phantom, as it has high contrast in conductivity, leading to better imaging.

    "Abstract": "Students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) face a continuous challenge with their attention span, putting them at a greater risk of academic or psychological difficulties compared to their peers. Innovative communication technologies are demonstrating potential to address these attention-span concerns. Virtual Reality (VR) is one such example, and has the potential to address attention-span difficulties among ADHD students. Accordingly, this study presents an EEG-based multimodal sensing pipeline as a methodological contribution, focusing on sensor-based data acquisition, signal processing, and neurophysiological interpretation to assess attention in VR-based environments, simulating a university supply chain educational topic. Thus, in this paper, a sequential exploratory approach investigated how 35 participants experienced an interactive VR-learning-driven supply chain game. A Brain–Computer Interaction (BCI) sensor generated insights by quantitatively analysing electroencephalogram (EEG) data that were processed through the proposed pipeline and integrated with subjective measures to validate participant’s subjective feelings. These insights originated from questions during the experiment that followed the Spatial Presence and Technology Acceptance Model to form a multimodal assessment framework. Findings demonstrated that the experimental group experienced a higher improved attention, concentration, engagement, and focus levels compared to the control group. BCI results from the experimental group showed more dominant voltage potentials in the right frontal and prefrontal cortex of the brain in areas responsible for attention, memory, and decision-making. A high acceptance of the VR technology among neurodiverse students highlights the added benefits of multimodal learning assessment methods in an educational setting.",

    "Abstract": "As IoT environments continue to grow in scale and complexity, the increasing number of interconnected sensors and devices makes end-to-end system behaviour progressively harder to understand. Process mining offers strong potential to address this challenge by transforming sensor-driven event data into interpretable insights at the process level. Yet, current tools are typically designed for business processes, not sensor-driven IoT workflows, which raises questions about their suitability in the IoT context. This discrepancy is evident in existing comparative studies, which often rely on feature checklists, rarely consider usability and interaction effort, or fail to evaluate support for domain-specific analytical tasks. This study introduces a structured evaluation methodology that combines a functional capability assessment derived from vendor materials with a task-based evaluation grounded in 13 representative questions from an IoT-oriented smart factory scenario, focusing on clarity, ease of use, and the ability to address context-specific analytical needs. The results highlight notable strengths and trade-offs among the investigated tools, demonstrating substantial variation in usability, effort, and analytical coverage, and showing that no single tool fully supports the breadth of process-intelligence needs in IoT contexts. The proposed methodology provides a replicable foundation for evaluating process mining tools in domain-specific settings and supports more informed tool selection for IoT-driven analytical workflows.",

    "Abstract": "Deception detection with low-channel wearable EEG requires protocols that generalize across people while remaining practical for portable devices. Using the public LieWaves dataset (27 subjects recorded with a five-channel Emotiv Insight headset), we evaluate to what extent five-channel head-mounted EEG can support lie–truth discrimination under both subject-independent and subject-dependent evaluations. For the subject-independent setting, we train a compact Residual Network with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks (ResNet-SE) model on raw overlapping windows with focal loss, light data augmentation, and grouped cross-validation by subject; out-of-fold window probabilities are averaged per session and converted to labels using a single decision threshold estimated from the cross-validated session scores. For the subject-dependent setting, we adopt an overlapping short-window Residual Temporal Convolutional Network with Squeeze-and-Excitation and Attention (Res-TCN-SE-Attention) model that fuses raw EEG with discrete wavelet transform (DWT)-based spectral and handcrafted band-power and Hjorth features, using an 80/10/10 split at the recording/session level (stratified by session label), so that all windows from a given session are assigned to a single subset; because each subject contributes two sessions, the same subject may still appear across subsets via different sessions. The subject-independent model attains 66.70% session-level accuracy with an AUC of 0.58 on unseen subjects, underscoring the difficulty of person-independent generalization from low-channel wearable EEG. Because practical deployment requires generalization to previously unseen individuals, we treat the subject-independent evaluation as the primary estimate of real-world generalization. In contrast, the subject-dependent pipeline reaches 99.94% window-level accuracy under the overlapping sliding-window (OSW) setting with a session-disjoint split (no session contributes windows to more than one subset). This near-ceiling performance reflects the optimistic nature of subject-dependent evaluation with highly overlapping windows, even when avoiding within-session train–test overlap, and should not be interpreted as a meaningful indicator of deception-detection capability under realistic deployment constraints. These results suggest limited, above-chance separability between lie and truth sessions in LieWaves using a five-channel wearable EEG under the studied protocol; however, performance remains far from deployment-ready and is strongly shaped by evaluation design. Explicit reporting of both protocols, together with clear rules for windowing, aggregation, and threshold selection, supports more reproducible and comparable benchmarking.",

    "Abstract": "The detection of defects in key transmission-line equipment under complex environments often suffers from insufficient accuracy and reliability due to background interference and multi-scale feature variations. To address this issue, this paper proposes an improved defect detection model based on YOLOv11, named DCDW-YOLOv11. The model introduces deformable convolution C2f_DCNv3 in the backbone network to enhance adaptability to geometric deformations of targets, and incorporates the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) to highlight defect features while suppressing background interference. In the detection head, a dynamic head structure (DyHead) is adopted to achieve cross-layer multi-scale feature fusion and collaborative perception, along with the WIoU loss function to optimize bounding box regression and sample weight allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that on the transmission-line equipment defect dataset, DCDW-YOLOv11 achieves an accuracy, recall, and mAP of 94.4%, 92.8%, and 96.3%, respectively, representing improvements of 2.8%, 7.0%, and 4.4% over the original YOLOv11, and outperforming other mainstream detection models. The proposed method can provide high-precision and highly reliable defect detection support for intelligent inspection of transmission lines in complex scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a Gram-negative pathogen with a remarkable capacity to acquire multiple resistance mechanisms, severely limiting current therapeutic options. Consequently, the identification of new antimicrobial agents remains a critical priority. In this study, an integrated in silico-guided strategy was applied to identify small molecules with antibacterial potential against P. aeruginosa, targeting the quorum-sensing regulator LasR (PDB ID: 2UV0) and elastase (PDB ID: 1U4G). Pharmacophore modeling was performed for both targets, followed by ligand-based virtual screening, structure-based virtual screening (SBVS), and MM-GBSA (Molecular Mechanics-Generalized Born Surface Area) binding free energy calculations. Top-ranked compounds based on predicted binding affinity were selected for in vitro cytotoxicity and antibacterial evaluation. Antimicrobial activity was assessed against three P. aeruginosa strains: an American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) reference strain, a clinically susceptible isolate, and an extensively drug-resistant (XDR) clinical isolate. SBVS yielded docking scores ranging from −6.96 to −12.256 kcal/mol, with MM-GBSA binding free energies between −18.554 and −88.00 kcal/mol. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays revealed that MolPort-001-974-907, MolPort-002-099-073, MolPort-008-336-135, and MolPort-008-339-179 exhibited MIC values of 62.5 µg/mL against the ATCC strain, indicating weak-to-moderate antibacterial activity consistent with early-stage hit compounds. MolPort-008-336-135 showed the most favorable activity against the clinically susceptible isolate, with an MIC of 62.5 µg/mL, while maintaining HepG2 cell viability above 70% at this concentration and an half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) greater than 500 µg/mL. In contrast, all tested compounds displayed MIC values above 62.5 µg/mL against the XDR isolate, reflecting limited efficacy against highly resistant strains. Overall, these results demonstrate the utility of in silico-driven approaches for the identification of antibacterial hit compounds targeting LasR and elastase, while highlighting the need for structure–activity relationship optimization to improve potency, selectivity, and activity against multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa.",

    "Abstract": "Even when designed by and for members of (multiple) oppressed groups, nightlife is generally an unsafe experience. In response to this, awareness teams have emerged internationally in recent years, ensuring that members of these groups can continue to participate in nightlife. Based on semi-structured qualitative interviews with activists in Graz, Austria, contextualised with autoethnography as well as a discourse analysis of policies and recommendations from activists in the broader Austrian and European contexts, I explore in this paper how awareness labour can contribute to transformative justice. I argue that by preventing the most vulnerable members of oppressed groups from being excluded from nightlife and educating everyone who engages with them within nightlife about oppression and privilege, awareness labour sits at the intersection of care and activism. As such, it bears potential to effect social change by teaching a broad segment of society about different practices of coming together that are not based on exploitation, extraction, or oppression. Awareness labour broadens our understanding of activism by intervening in the unjust distribution of care. The paper concludes by proposing areas for further research to determine how to realise the transformative potential of awareness labour.",

    "Abstract": "Monitoring adolescent team-sport athletes may benefit from combining performance and molecular markers, but empirical evidence supporting this approach in youth team sports remains limited. Objective: Our study investigated molecular and physiological adaptations to seasonal training in elite U18 ice hockey players, focusing on aerobic capacity, salivary cortisol, serum irisin, and cell-free DNA (cfDNA) dynamics. Methods: National-level U18 players were enrolled in our study (n = 23 for cross-sectional analysis, n = 12 longitudinal) during the pre- and early-competition season. Aerobic performance was assessed via graded treadmill VO2max testing, and the biochemical markers quantified using ELISA-based assays. Results: From pre- to early-season (paired n = 12), VO2max increased by 10.6% (g = +1.00, p = 0.003) and irisin by 14.7% (g = +0.83, p = 0.010). cfDNA decreased by 60.8% (g = −0.54, p = 0.070; moderate effect, not statistically clear), while cortisol remained stable (+11.3%; p = 0.667). Inter-individual variability increased for VO2max and irisin and decreased by 82% for cfDNA. Exploratory cross-sectional positional analysis indicated higher irisin levels in forwards and elevated cfDNA in defensemen, although differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: These preliminary findings provide cohort-size limited longitudinal evidence of chronic irisin elevation in ice hockey players and highlight the possibility of combining VO2max + irisin + cfDNA to assist individualized load/recovery in elite youth ice hockey.",

    "Abstract": "Jump height (JH) is widely used as an indicator of athletic performance. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the relative importance and predictive value of JH for neuromuscular performance across key physical metrics and (2) describe the neuromuscular profile of soccer players from different age groups, positions, and competitive levels. Senior (SG) and youth (YG) players were evaluated after the off season for neuromuscular power, strength, change of direction, speed, repeated sprint ability, and aerobic endurance. SG outperformed YG in most measures, especially JH, abduction strength, and Peak Power (RAST PP). Notably, YG exhibited higher maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and lower fatigue index (RAST FI), highlighting their robust aerobic capacity and greater ability to sustain repeated efforts. These results reinforce established developmental patterns, with aerobic endurance more pronounced in youth and anaerobic power in seniors. In seniors, JH correlated moderately with sprint and anaerobic power, while its associations in youth were weaker and linked to endurance. Positional analysis suggested overall higher JH in SG. JH emerged as a practical predictor for physical performance monitoring in seniors and a useful benchmark for athletic potential identification. Findings support targeted training and monitoring based on age-specific profiles. This study enhances applied sports science, underscoring the need for tailored approaches in player development and evaluation.",

    "Abstract": "Neighborhood living streets are key everyday public spaces in mixed residential–commercial districts and are an important setting for residents’ mental well-being. Yet many neighborhood evaluations still rely on coarse spatial indicators and provide limited guidance for fine-grained renewal. This study develops a comprehensive, mental-health-relevant, perception-based framework for assessing living-street quality and applies it to Xuesong Road, an aging community street in Wuhan. Five perception dimensions—walkability, safety, comfort, sociability, and pleasure—are operationalized into 18 micro-spatial indicators. Indicator weights are derived from expert judgments using the Analytic Hierarchy Process, and 178 residents’ Likert-scale ratings are synthesized using Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation to obtain dimension-level and composite scores. On a five-point scale, the overall score of 3.08 indicates a mid-range level of perceived street quality in relation to mental health. Sociability performs best, followed by walkability, pleasure, and comfort, while safety is the weakest dimension, mainly due to conflicts with non-motorized traffic and inadequate nighttime lighting. The proposed AHP–FCE framework links micro-scale street attributes to perception-based outcomes and provides actionable evidence to inform micro-renewal, with safety-oriented interventions being prioritized to support social sustainability and age-friendly communities.",

    "Abstract": "Following the launch of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) process at the Rio+20 Summit, China has progressively strengthened sustainability-oriented considerations in development target setting and administration cadre performance assessment, which provides an institutional window to examine how the transformation of development goals reshapes urban land supply patterns. This study develops a spatial general equilibrium model and uses panel data for 286 prefecture-level cities in China from 2007 to 2021 to examine how the transformation of development goals affects urban land supply patterns. The results show that higher economic growth targets significantly expand total land supply, raise the ratio of industrial to residential land supply, and tighten floor-area-ratio (FAR) regulation. “Soft constraint” wording dampens the effect on land supply scale but strengthens the effects on land supply structure and FAR regulation, while the degree of vertical and horizontal target escalation generates substantial heterogeneity in these relationships. Moreover, after governance shifted from growth-oriented to sustainability-oriented objectives, the marginal effectiveness of using land supply structure and FAR regulation to deliver predetermined growth targets declined significantly. This study provides empirical evidence and policy-relevant insights for improving sustainability-oriented target accountability systems and urban governance incentive mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "This study addresses the intensifying conflict between conservation and tourism development in global natural World Heritage sites by exploring how cognitive misalignments among stakeholders obstruct scene–village symbiosis and by proposing governance strategies grounded in cognitive coordination to enhance sustainable governance effectiveness. Focusing on three representative villages located in the overlapping area of the Li River World Heritage protection zone and the scenic tourism area, which represent the consolidation/maturity, emerging incubation, and potential cultivation stages of tourism development, the study employs Q methodology to identify stakeholder cognitive clusters and their interactive logics. Four cognitive clusters are revealed: utilitarian landscape instrumentalism, livelihood entitlement-oriented, nostalgic disciplinary gaze, and institutional risk aversion. Their presence and combinations vary across different development stages, forming distinct cognitive configurations. These clusters exhibit both couplings and tensions in value preferences, benefit claims, and action logic, which shape rule acceptance and willingness to collaborate. By overcoming the limitations of conventional surveys in capturing latent perceptions, this study proposes an integrated “cognitive differences—strategic interactions—policy mechanisms” framework. The findings offer transferable insights for managing multi-stakeholder heritage destinations, particularly in ecologically fragile areas facing overtourism pressures and sustainability challenges.",

    "Abstract": "This research addresses the challenge of assessing ecosystem services, ecosystem condition, and agricultural externalities in a Latin American socio-ecological context, where primary production is both a major economic activity and a pressure on ecosystems. In Uruguay, the intensification of agriculture and livestock farming has raised concerns about nutrient-related externalities affecting water and soil quality. Although the System of Environmental and Economic Accounting (SEEA)—Ecosystem Accounting framework is used for better ecosystem management, it does not explicitly represent externalities. Using the Santa Lucía sub-basin in Uruguay (supplying water to 60% of the population) as a case study, this research combines the Soil and Water Assessment (SWAT) Tool with ecosystem accounting principles to assess ecosystem services, ecosystem condition, and externalities. Model outputs are used to compile partial ecosystem accounts in physical terms, integrating spatially explicit indicators. Results show that nutrient losses to surface waters, interpreted as agricultural externalities, are predominantly driven by diffuse sources associated with croplands and dairy systems and shaped by hydrological connectivity. Despite data and model-related uncertainties, the approach supports hotspot identification and the spatial targeting of interventions and provides the basis for future monetary assessment, illustrating how hydrological modeling can complement ecosystem accounting in data-scarce contexts.",

    "Abstract": "In order to identify an efficient and environmentally friendly washing agent for heavy metal-contaminated soil, this study selected seven natural amino acids—arginine (Arg), alanine (Ala), glycine (Gly), cysteine (Cys), lysine (Lys), threonine (Thr), and glutamic acid (Glu)—based on their water solubility, effectiveness, and functional group characteristics. According to the removal efficiencies for zinc (Zn), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd), Cys, which contains a specific sulfhydryl group (-SH), was chosen as the target leaching agent for the remediation of composite-contaminated soil. The optimal process conditions were determined as follows: 0.02 mol/L of cysteine concentration, liquid-to-soil ratio of 20:1 (mL/g), 10 min of ultrasonic time, and pH = 8.0. The order of removal efficiency was Pb (40.8%) &gt; Zn (21.6%) &gt; Cd (19.9%). The leaching process selective effects on the speciation fractions of Zn, Pb, and Cd in the soil, and these differences can be explained by the hard–soft acid–base theory and the strength of coordination between the metals and cysteine. Mechanism analysis revealed that soil washing essentially achieves selective extraction of the target metal through strong chemical interactions between functional groups of cysteine and active metal sites of secondary minerals in the soil. Cysteine is a green remediation agent with high selectivity and environmental compatibility for contaminated soil. Its application requires precise design and risk assessment based on the chemical properties of the target metals, while ensuring the sustainability of the soil to maintain the ecological functions and long-term health of the remediated soil.",

    "Abstract": "The residential building sector is a significant source of global energy consumption and carbon emissions, especially in rapidly changing rural areas. In China, the shift from vernacular courtyard dwellings to modern rural housing has altered the relationship among architectural form, thermal comfort (TC), and energy use. Vernacular dwellings in northern China employ passive strategies, such as courtyard-centred layouts, high thermal-mass envelopes, and natural ventilation, to achieve summer comfort with minimal energy input. In contrast, modern dwellings (brick–concrete) depend more on mechanical cooling and consume more electricity. This study investigates how dwelling type, spatial configuration, building materials, courtyard configuration, thermal comfort, and housing satisfaction interact to shape residential environmental adaptability in rural Handan, Hebei Province. A questionnaire survey of 383 households was analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). To supplement perceptual data, summer electricity consumption was monitored in 20 typical dwellings from June to August 2025, and on-site measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, and courtyard air velocity were conducted in six representative cases. The results indicate that dwelling type significantly affects spatial configuration and courtyard form, while spatial configuration and courtyard characteristics together influence material performance. Thermal comfort is identified as a key mediating variable with a strong direct impact on housing satisfaction. Field measurements confirm that vernacular dwellings have lower summer electricity consumption, more stable thermal conditions, improved humidity regulation, and higher courtyard air velocity, indicating superior passive cooling potential. These findings provide empirical evidence that incorporating vernacular passive design principles into contemporary rural housing can improve thermal comfort and reduce energy dependence, thereby supporting climate-responsive, low-carbon rural revitalization strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) has emerged as a critical paradigm for corporate sustainable development. In the maritime industry, a sector central to global trade, ESG is gaining prominence, driven by regulatory pressures and investor demands. This study conducts a systematic literature review to map the research landscape of ESG in the shipping industry from 2020 to 2024. Employing the PRISMA methodology, we analyze 20 core academic papers from the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Our findings reveal a rapidly growing research interest, with a clear thematic evolution from a singular focus on environmental issues to a more holistic, three-pillar (E, S, and G) framework. Key research hotspots identified include the relationship between ESG performance and financial performance, ESG disclosure, and risk management. While a positive correlation between good ESG practices and corporate financial performance is a recurring theme, significant challenges persist, notably inconsistent disclosure standards, fragmented global research efforts, and a lack of industry-specific evaluation frameworks. This review synthesizes the current state of knowledge, identifies critical research gaps, and proposes a forward-looking agenda focusing on developing industry-specific frameworks, analyzing external institutional impacts, and enhancing data credibility. Our findings provide a foundational reference for academics, policymakers, and industry practitioners to advance the sustainable transformation of the shipping industry.",

    "Abstract": "The optimal composition of an asphalt mixture, composed from the various mineral materials and bituminous binders, is produced in an asphalt mixing plant (AMP). Various AMP properties determine the suitability of this complex, long-term-use technological equipment in meeting contemporary requirements. Worn AMPs are replaced with new ones when they fail to satisfy these requirements. The AMP purchase process consists of two separate parts: (1) the decision-making process—whether there is a need to purchase a new AMP; and (2) AMP suitability—the evaluation of various technical and other properties, related to the AMP itself. This research paper considers the second part of the AMP purchase process and presents a new twenty-criteria system that identifies the most important AMP quality parameters indicating AMP suitability. The weights of the quality criteria for a new AMP were established by applying the Average Rank Transformation into Weight-Linear (ARTIW-L), Non-Linear (ARTIW-N) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods. Furthermore, the paper presents and verifies the Inverse Hierarchy for Assessment of Main Criteria Importance (IHAMCI) method. The findings of the research show that customers consider technological parameters to be the most important, followed by technical performance. Economical indicators rank third, while ecological (environmental) indicators receive the least attention. Future research will assess the sustainability requirements applied to operating AMPs in recent years.",

    "Abstract": "Laboratory test results for vehicle emissions, fuel economy, and driving range often fail to reflect real-world performance, undermining the effectiveness of sustainability policies and consumer guidance. This study provides the first integrated national assessment of real-world emissions and range outcomes for passenger vehicles in Australia. Using Portable Emissions Measurement Systems (PEMS) data from 114 petrol, diesel, hybrid, and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) tested by the Australian Automobile Association (AAA), the analysis compares laboratory-certified values against on-road results and benchmarks them with international datasets from Europe and China. Real-world CO2 emissions were, on average, 6.9% higher than laboratory ratings for petrol vehicles and 3.2% higher for diesel vehicles. Many diesel models exceeded Euro 6 NOx limits by several multiples, while hybrids exhibited inconsistent CO2 reductions under urban conditions. BEVs also displayed measurable divergence: real-world energy consumption was 1–20% higher than laboratory ratings, resulting in an average 16% reduction in effective driving range relative to WLTP values. These outcomes reveal a consistent tendency toward overstated laboratory performance across powertrains, highlighting systemic shortcomings in certification test cycles. The findings have direct implications for greenhouse gas mitigation, urban air quality, and consumer energy efficiency and support Australia’s active transition to WLTP and Euro 6 standards, institutionalisation of real-world testing, and inclusion of verified real-world energy use and range data in consumer labelling to enhance transparency and policy effectiveness.",

    "Abstract": "Intangible cultural heritage products (ICHPs) function as an important medium through which regional cultural values are communicated within tourism consumption, thereby supporting the sustainability of cultural heritage practices. However, existing research provides limited insight into the psychological mechanisms underlying region-specific purchase intentions. To address this gap, this study extends the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) by incorporating cultural identity and consumer knowledge as antecedent variables and product scarcity as a moderating factor, with the aim of explaining tourists’ purchase intention toward Bashu ICHPs in China. Data were collected from 429 tourists and analyzed using structural equation modeling and hierarchical regression techniques. The results indicate that cultural identity and consumer knowledge indirectly influence purchase intention through attitudes and subjective norms, whereas perceived behavioral control emerges as the strongest direct predictor of purchase intention. In addition, product scarcity significantly strengthens several relationships between the antecedent variables and the core TPB components, thereby amplifying culturally and cognitively driven decision-making processes. Overall, this study deepens theoretical understanding of consumer behavior within regional cultural heritage systems and provides practical insights for the sustainable development and marketing of Bashu ICHPs.",

    "Abstract": "This study investigates the performance consequences of adopting emerging digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, and cloud computing, with attention to financial, operational, and environmental dimensions. Using an event study of 134 adoption announcements by publicly traded U.S. firms from 2009 to 2019, we compare adopters with matched control firms identified through propensity score matching. The empirical evidence shows that adoption is followed by gains in profitability and market valuation, reflected in improvements in return on assets, return on equity, and Tobin’s Q, alongside higher inventory turnover. At the same time, adopting firms exhibit a measurable decline in greenhouse gas emissions when compared with matched control firms. Taken together, these results suggest that digital transformation can align economic performance with environmental improvement, rather than forcing firms to choose between the two. The findings therefore provide practical guidance for managers and policymakers seeking to evaluate digital investments through the lens of long-term sustainability.",

This paper investigates the construction and classification of finite commutative rings of order p6r in which the set of zero-divisors J forms an ideal satisfying the conditions J3=0, J2≠0 with J2 being principal. Under these conditions, the rings considered are precisely the Frobenius local rings. A Frobenius local (completely primary) ring R with these properties is referred to as a ring with property (P). These rings naturally divide into three classes according to their characteristic: p, p2, or p3. In the case of characteristic p2, a further distinction is made depending on whether p lies in J2 or in J∖J2, where J denotes the Jacobson radical of R. The classification is achieved by associating to each ring a canonical matrix corresponding to a bilinear form and then applying matrix congruence techniques to reduce the problem to linear algebra over finite fields. This yields a complete and explicit description of all Frobenius local rings with property (P) of order p6r, including their algebraic structure and enumeration.",

    "Abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) correlation functions are central to understanding structural crossovers in soft-core fluids; however, their asymptotic analysis is hindered by the Hankel-transform kernel, whose asymptotic representation introduces a term that breaks the natural conjugate symmetry of the poles. To address this, we present a symmetric contour integration scheme that restores symmetry at the level of the integration path. By employing quarter-circle contours in the first and fourth quadrants, the method captures conjugate pole pairs simultaneously and evaluates the sine term from the Bessel-function asymptotic without variable transformation or real-part extraction, yielding closed-form analytic expressions for the long-range decay of the density–density correlation function. The approach is demonstrated for a 2D Gaussian-charge one-component plasma under the random phase approximation at intermediate coupling, where the pole analysis provides direct access to the oscillation wavelength and decay length. In the high-density regime, the pole equations simplify to a form amenable to a Lambert W-function approximation, revealing a logarithmic scaling of correlation lengths even at moderate coupling. These findings establish symmetric contour integration as a transparent and versatile framework for pole-resolved asymptotics in 2D liquids.",

    "Abstract": "Symmetry plays a fundamental role in the evolution of mining-induced stress fields and the deformation behavior of roadway surrounding rock. To improve control of roadway deformation under strong mining-induced disturbance, this study takes the 12 Upper 301 face at Buertai Coal Mine and investigates the deformation mechanism and corresponding control methods. Based on an analysis of in situ monitoring data, the key stratum responsible for energy accumulation in the overlying strata was identified. Based on the inherent symmetry of the longwall mining layout, a symmetric predictive model of overburden key-stratum abutment pressure is established, which reveals the spatially symmetric distribution characteristics of the mining-induced stress field. The accuracy of the theoretical model was further verified through a large-scale geomechanical similarity model test, which reproduced the fracture trajectory and stress evolution law of the overburden key strata. To mitigate strong mining pressure, a targeted hydraulic fracturing control technique aimed at specific overburden horizons was proposed and verified through field testing and application. Field monitoring results indicate that roof-to-floor convergence peaked at 235 mm, and rib convergence peaked at 115 mm. Compared with sections without hydraulic fracturing control, the surrounding rock deformation was reduced by 62.3% and 69.7%, respectively, demonstrating a significant pressure relief effect. This approach effectively ensured the roadway stability and enabled safe mining operations.",

    "Abstract": "In today’s increasingly fierce global competition in science and technology, China’s chip industry is facing a global technology blockade and market containment. Against this backdrop, research on the resilience of China’s chip industrial chain is of great significance to improve the survival and recovery ability of the chip industry under extreme conditions. Therefore, this study uses the system dynamics method to build a simulation model for the resilience of China’s chip industry. The model examines four regulatory scenarios: enhancing R&amp;D intensity, elevating innovation development, promoting resource recycling and utilization, and expanding the depth of policy promotion. The simulation results of China’s chip industrial chain from 2014 to 2024 show the following: First, the resilience level of China’s chip industrial chain initially decreases but then subsequently increases. Second, all four regulatory scenarios improve the simulated resilience value of the industrial chain to varying degrees. Among them, the regulatory scenario of elevating innovation development has the most pronounced effect. However, while the improvement from promoting resource recycling and utilization is relatively limited, it helps to continuously improve the safety level of the chip industrial chain. Third, moderately increasing the total intensity of R&amp;D and expanding the depth of policy promotion are conducive to regulation of the current chip industrial chain’s elasticity.",

    "Abstract": "The evaluation of China’s Low-Carbon City Pilot Policy (LCCP) is critical to understanding its role in mitigating climate challenges associated with carbon emissions. While most existing research has concentrated narrowly on emission reductions within pilot cities, broader improvements in emission performance have often been overlooked. To address this gap, our study employs an integrated methodological framework combining Difference-in-Differences (DID) with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), enabling a dual-perspective assessment of policy effectiveness. Baseline regression results confirm that the LCCP has led to a statistically significant decrease in total urban carbon emissions. Pilot cities achieved an average reduction in emission levels that was 4.8 percentage points greater than that of non-pilot cities, underscoring the policy’s tangible impact. Further analysis using DEA reveals a consistent year-on-year enhancement in the dynamic carbon emission performance of these cities. Regionally disaggregated results highlight distinct drivers of low-carbon performance: in low-emission cities such as Huangshan, gains were primarily efficiency-led; in medium-emission cities like Beijing, technological advancement served as the main catalyst; and in high-emission cities including Shanghai, both efficiency gains and technological innovation jointly propelled progress. These findings offer valuable empirical insights for customizing low-carbon transition pathways across cities with varying emission profiles.",

This study develops a dual-layer coupled network model linking consumer attitude dissemination and enterprise R&amp;D strategy evolution under bounded observability. Our simulations show three main findings. First, stronger discouragement of counter-attitudinal dissemination markedly suppresses diffusion and lowers steady-state adoption. Second, diffusion strengthens when consumers weight public information more and firm messaging less, particularly under stronger policy support. Third, network structure shapes diffusion: stronger inter-enterprise connectivity increases adoption, and consumer topology and interaction breadth exert different effects under different network types. These results clarify how information environments, policy support, and cross-layer behavioral modulation jointly shape diffusion regimes.",

The proposed configuration requires only two grounded resistors and one floating capacitor, which contributes to a low component count, facilitates integration, and allows for the electronic tunability of the pole frequency through the transconductance gain of the VDCC. This work also demonstrates two practical biomedical applications: an electrocardiogram (ECG) acquisition system utilizing the VM low-pass filter for noise suppression and a bioimpedance (BioZ) measurement system employing the proposed configuration-based CM oscillator circuit as a sinusoidal excitation source. The performance validation confirms the accuracy of impedance extraction and the preservation of waveforms using tissue-equivalent models.

    "Abstract": "This study examines how community-based tourism (CBT) supports sustainable livelihoods by clarifying the mediating roles of community participation and tourism-related employment. Drawing on the Sustainable Livelihood Framework, Community Participation Theory, and the community development and empowerment approach, survey data were collected from 320 CBT-involved residents in three Vietnamese CBT settings (Ba Vì–Hà Nội, Lào Cai, and Lâm Đồng) during April–June 2025. Using PLS-SEM with bootstrapping and IPMA, the findings show that community participation and tourism-related employment are pivotal pathways through which livelihood assets translate into sustainable livelihood outcomes. Indigenous cultural values and policy commitment enhance livelihoods mainly by stimulating employment generation, whereas community awareness, human resource capacity, and access to financial capital operate primarily by strengthening community participation. IPMA indicates that participation and employment represent the most actionable leverage points for interventions. This study’s novelty lies in providing a mechanism-based explanation of CBT’s livelihood effects and converting SEM evidence into practical prioritization. Policy and managerial implications emphasize strengthening inclusive participation mechanisms, expanding and upgrading local employment (skills development, job stability, and market linkages), and reinforcing enabling institutional support that safeguards indigenous cultural values while improving household livelihood resilience in CBT contexts.",

Source apportionment was further investigated using characteristic ratios, correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression. The results indicate that the average concentration of Σ24OVOCs during the observation period was 2.70 ± 1.55 ppb. Formaldehyde, acetone, and acetaldehyde were the dominant species, accounting for 94.5% of the total concentration in this background area. A significant seasonal difference in carbonyl concentrations was observed, with the average concentration in autumn (3.68 ± 1.66 ppb) being approximately 2.1 times higher than that in winter (1.78 ± 0.58 ppb). The diurnal variation in most carbonyls exhibited a pattern of nighttime accumulation and daytime depletion, which was consistent with the trend of NO2. The OFP results show that the average OFP of Σ24OVOCs was 30 ± 16 μg/m3, with formaldehyde contributing 86.9%, identifying it as a key precursor for ozone formation in the background region. Source analysis revealed that carbonyl compounds in autumn were influenced by combined natural, vehicular, and industrial sources, with significant secondary formation (27–36%) observed for C2 (acetaldehyde) and C3 (mainly acetone and propanal) species. In winter, anthropogenic contributions to carbonyls increased, with C2 and C3 species primarily originating from combustion sources, vehicle emissions, and industrial releases. This study provides the first insights into the pollution characteristics and source profiles of carbonyl compounds during autumn and winter at the Shangdianzi background site, offering a scientific basis for understanding regional atmospheric oxidative capacity and formulating integrated air pollution control strategies.",

Sample preparation was optimized for each matrix: salting-out assisted liquid–liquid extraction (SALLE) with perchloric acidification for urine and feces, and a dilute–evaporate–shoot (DES) approach for plasma. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a BEH C18 column with water-ACN containing 0.5% formic acid.

    "Abstract": "Air pollution is a major environmental health hazard. This study evaluates the health risks of air pollution exposure in the megacity Karachi, Pakistan, using the cigarette-equivalent technique developed previously for translating air pollution exposure into passive cigarette equivalents. Sampling of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and black carbon (BC) was performed at various fixed locations throughout the four seasons of the year. We evaluated the health risks of pollutants exposure using four different health endpoints including low birth weight (&lt;2500 g at term after 37 weeks of gestation), decreased lung function (Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s), cardiovascular mortality, and lung cancer in residents of Karachi. The average risks of low birth weight from PM2.5, NO2, and BC were 37.2, 14.8, and 1.01, respectively, (expressed as the equivalent number of passively smoked cigarettes, PSCs) while the average risks of decreased lung function were 93.9, 38.8, and 2.87. Risks of cardiovascular mortality were 51.9, 14.3, and 2.79, and those of lung cancer were 31.3, 6.47, and 1.32, respectively. The remarkably high risks are attributed to high concentrations of air pollutants. These results suggests that residents of Karachi may experience other adverse health effects beyond those typically attributed to air pollution. These PSC equivalent risks indicate a substantial potential health burden in Karachi and support the need for emission reduction efforts targeting traffic, industrial activity, and open burning. PM2.5 and BC were measured in 2008–2011 and NO2 in 2008–2009, so the results should be interpreted as baseline risk estimates for that period rather than current (2025) concentrations.",

    "Abstract": "Urban green is a key component of municipal natural resources management (MNRM) in metropolitan areas, providing ecosystem services (ESs) related to climate regulation, environmental quality, and citizens’ well-being. However, these ESs are often weakly integrated into municipal management practices, and this may be due to the absence of structured accountability and reporting mechanisms. This study examines whether a topic-specific Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting framework for urban green could support the integration of ecosystem services into MNRM. The research is based on semi-structured interviews with representatives from 23 municipalities across Greece, exploring awareness of ESG concepts, views on accountability and stakeholder engagement, and perceptions of urban green as a managed natural resource. The findings indicate broad recognition of the multifunctional role of urban green and strong agreement on the value of systematic reporting and accountability. At the same time, municipalities identify the lack of an appropriate reporting framework as a key constraint, alongside organizational and staffing limitations. Drawing on stakeholder and impression management theory, the study shows the respondents support that urban green ESG reporting can function as a governance tool, enhancing transparency and stakeholder involvement. A municipal ESG reporting framework is perceived as a tool that could support operationalizing ESs within local governance structures, contributing to a more effective MNRM.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Vaccination coverage among adolescents remains below the recommended target, highlighting the need for effective educational strategies to improve vaccine knowledge. This study aimed to assess baseline knowledge of vaccines and immune mechanisms among adolescents and to evaluate whether a school-based educational intervention can improve knowledge related to vaccination. Methods: A prospective quasi-experimental pre–post study was conducted between 1 February 2025 and 1 June 2025 among adolescents aged 14–19 years attending high schools in Southern Italy. The intervention was based on the e-Bug educational module and delivered by trained nurses through interactive lessons, gamification, and guided discussions. Vaccine-related knowledge was assessed using a questionnaire administered before and after the intervention. Changes in knowledge scores were analyzed using paired statistical tests, and the effect size was estimated. A stepwise multivariate linear regression model was employed to identify factors associated with post-intervention test scores, with statistical significance set as p ≤ 0.05. Results: Among 386 participants, the majority were female (74.2%), the average age was 15.8, and 15% reported a chronic medical condition. Knowledge gaps were observed at baseline, particularly regarding the items on recommended adolescent vaccinations (37.4%), the definition of innate immunity (25.6%), and the mechanism of vaccines’ action (51%). After the intervention, all the items showed an improvement in correct answers, statistically significant for 5 of the 7 analyzed items (r = 0.364, p &lt; 0.001). The most pronounced improvement was in the awareness of age-specific recommended vaccines (61.2%). The multivariate linear regression analysis showed that those with higher pre-intervention test scores, those who had parents with chronic medical conditions, those whose fathers worked, and those willing to participate in similar future interventions were more likely to achieve higher post-intervention test scores. Conclusions: School-based interventions may represent an effective strategy for enhancing adolescents’ knowledge related to vaccination, but further studies with control groups and long-term follow-up are needed to confirm effectiveness.",

    "Abstract": "Respiratory infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality in older adults and other at-risk adult populations. Despite the availability of effective vaccines, adult vaccination coverage remains suboptimal. This narrative review examines strategies designed to improve vaccine uptake among non-pregnant adults aged ≥18 years and inform future adult vaccination strategies. We conducted a targeted literature search using keywords for vaccination, respiratory diseases, strategy/program/implementation, and adults in PubMed database and CDC, WHO, and ECDC websites, between 2014 and 2024. A snowball search of literature reviews and key references was also performed to identify additional relevant studies. Eligible publications focused on vaccination strategies against influenza, COVID-19, and pneumococcal disease targeting non-pregnant adults (≥18 years). We categorized the strategies by intervention type to describe their influence on vaccination campaigns and vaccine uptake/coverage. We included 45 publications, encompassing strategies focused on individual decision-making, healthcare system functions, and national policy. Educational and awareness interventions (such as healthcare worker/provider recommendations during consultation, phone calls, letters, text messages, and social media outreach) reportedly raised vaccination rates. Access-related factors, including convenient vaccination sites and free or subsidized vaccines, were reported to be important factors in improving coverage in underserved communities. Within healthcare settings, strategies such as continuous vaccine provider training and workflow/process optimization were shown to enhance vaccination delivery. At the local or national policy levels, legislation governing program targets shaped immunization efforts and facilitated collaborations and partnerships to expand campaign reach. The findings may inform policymakers and public health/immunization practitioners in designing context-specific immunization initiatives that effectively reach adult populations.",

    "Abstract": "This study analyzed how climate variability affects lactation yield and reproduction in Holstein cows in a continental climate. It specifically compared Wet-Bulb Temperature (Twb) with the standard Temperature–Humidity Index (THI). We conducted a retrospective study on a dairy farm in Konya, Türkiye, analyzing a total of 144 complete lactation records from a herd of 90 cows calving between 2022 and 2023. To rule out nutritional factors, a consistent TMR diet without pasture access was maintained in both years. Average Daily Milk Yield (ADMY) was calculated to adjust for lactation length. Climatic data showed a distinct contrast. Ambient temperatures and THI were similar between years (p &gt; 0.05). However, 2022 was characterized by “humid heat” (high Twb), while 2023 presented a “dry heat” profile with significantly lower Twb (p &lt; 0.001). This difference significantly impacted performance. Cows in the 2023 group produced much higher milk yields (50.55 ± 3.01 kg) than the 2022 group (30.74 ± 0.81 kg) (p &lt; 0.001). Unexpectedly, milk yield peaked during the Autumn and Summer seasons of the low-humidity year. In contrast, fertility declined with thermal load. Poor winter fertility suggested a “carry-over” effect of previous heat stress. These findings show that Twb is a better indicator of thermal comfort than THI in continental climates. Furthermore, low humidity can significantly reduce the negative impact of heat on milk production.",

    "Abstract": "Due to the weak electrical response characteristics of groundwater nitrate contamination, traditional monitoring and remediation assessment methods are limited by low spatiotemporal resolution, high cost, and strong subjectivity. To address this issue, this study proposed an integrated technical framework combining field detection, laboratory-controlled experiments, and remediation process monitoring, aiming to explore the application potential of Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) in nitrate pollution monitoring and remediation evaluation. First, ERT survey lines (L1 and L2) were deployed at a chemical-contaminated site in Luzhou, Sichuan Province, and groundwater samples were collected. Coupled with hydrochemical analysis, the feasibility of ERT for identifying nitrate plumes was verified. Second, a quantitative response model between nitrate concentration and resistivity was established through Miller box experiments, and a multi-line layout was optimized via sand tank experiments to mitigate boundary effects and improve monitoring accuracy. Finally, grouped sand tank experiments involving electroactive bacteria (EAB) and magnetite were conducted. Combined with 16S rRNA sequencing, the coupling mechanism between ERT electrical responses and biogeochemical processes was elucidated. The results showed that the low-resistivity anomaly zones identified by field ERT were accurately consistent with the high-nitrate contamination zones, and Piper diagrams confirmed that nitrate-related ions were the primary cause of the low-resistivity anomalies. The power function quantitative model established by the Miller box experiment (y = 1021.97x−0.74, R2 = 0.9589) enabled the indirect inversion of nitrate concentrations, with a small deviation between theoretical and measured values in the deep layer (16–18 m). The optimized layout of one main and three auxiliary survey lines effectively characterized the spatiotemporal migration of the contamination plume. Under high-water level conditions, the ternary system of nitrate–magnetite–EAB exhibited the strongest low-resistivity response. Microbial analysis indicated that electroactive groups (e.g., Pseudomonas and Flavobacterium) enriched in the EAB group were the core drivers of enhanced electrical conductivity. The integrated ERT monitoring technology system constructed in this study realizes the visual identification of nitrate plumes and dynamic tracking of remediation processes, providing technical support for the precise monitoring and in situ remediation of nitrate contamination in agricultural non-point sources and industrial sites.",

    "Abstract": "This study evaluates seepage behavior and hydraulic gradient conditions at the Lam Phra Phloeng Earthfill Dam in Nakhon Ratchasima, Thailand, by integrating long-term instrumentation records, updated geotechnical data, and deterministic numerical modeling. Piezometer and observation-well data collected between 2007 and 2023 were screened for reliability, revealing that several sensors exhibited abnormal or non-responsive behavior, limiting direct interpretation of phreatic surface variations in critical zones. Reliable datasets were incorporated into SEEP/W seepage simulations using representative dam cross-sections and soil parameters derived from recent drilling and laboratory testing. The results indicate that under normal reservoir operation, the phreatic surface remains within the core–drainage system and hydraulic gradients are well below estimated critical thresholds for the clayey foundation. Elevated reservoir levels lead to increased pore-water pressures and higher hydraulic gradients, particularly near the downstream zones and the deep central section of the dam. Rapid drawdown produces the most unfavorable hydraulic condition, generating steep transient pore-pressure gradients that approach critical values and reduce hydraulic safety margins. Although no immediate evidence of piping or uncontrolled seepage was identified, malfunctioning instrumentation creates monitoring blind spots that increase uncertainty in real-time seepage assessment. This study demonstrates that hydraulic gradient-based interpretation of deterministic seepage modeling provides a practical screening tool for dam safety evaluation under data-limited conditions. The findings emphasize the importance of enhanced monitoring redundancy and conservative operational control to support risk-informed management of aging earthfill dams under increasing hydrological variability.",

    "Abstract": "Riparian soils co-contaminated with heavy metals and organic pollutants present a formidable environmental challenge; conventional single-target remediation strategies are frequently insufficient due to the synergistic interactions between contaminant classes. This review offers a systematic synthesis of phytoremediation as an integrative and ecologically sustainable paradigm for addressing these complex multi-pollutant scenarios. Through a critical examination of underlying mechanisms—namely phytoextraction, rhizodegradation, phytostabilization, and phytovolatilization—we evaluate the efficacy of selected hyperaccumulator and pollution-tolerant species in simultaneously mitigating inorganic (e.g., Pb, Cd, As) and organic (e.g., PAHs, pesticides) contaminants. Furthermore, the discussion highlights emerging strategic integrations, including genetic engineering for enhanced metal accumulation, the application of engineered nanomaterials to modulate pollutant bioavailability and plant stress tolerance, rhizosphere amendment with low-molecular-weight organic acids, and biochar-mediated immobilization coupled with microbial stimulation. The analysis posits that phytoremediation, particularly when augmented by these advanced synergies, constitutes a viable, multifunctional, and environmentally benign strategy for the holistic restoration of riparian ecosystems. Future inquiries should prioritize the mechanistic elucidation of combined technologies, the development of predictive performance models, and rigorous long-term field validation to guarantee operational efficacy and environmental safety.",

    "Abstract": "Drought leads to declining water levels and reduced water volume in lakes, significantly altering their water quality. Current research has primarily examined water quality during drought episodes or compared conditions before and after such events. However, the variations in water quality indicators and their relationships with hydrological factors across different drought stages, particularly during development and recovery periods, remain poorly understood. To address this gap, we investigated the stage-specific impacts of hydrological drought on lake water quality. Hydrological drought events were identified and segmented into development and recovery stages using the Standardized Water Level Index. Eight water quality indicators, including total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), were analyzed together with hydrological variables using Grey Relational Analysis (GRA). Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, served as the case study. The results revealed significant spatio-temporal heterogeneity in both drought characteristics and water quality responses. Development periods were generally longer than recovery periods. Dissolved oxygen (DO) was consistently lower during drought development, whereas TP increased during recovery. GRA indicated that the main drivers of TN and TP shifted across drought stages. During the development period, TN and TP were more closely coupled, and permanganate index and turbidity exerted strong influences. In contrast, during the recovery period, TN was primarily associated with conductivity, while TP became mainly dominated by turbidity. This paper not only supplements the theoretical understanding of the interaction between hydrological drought and water quality, but also provides scientific support for water quality early warning, and the water resource management of large freshwater lakes under drought scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Rhabdomyolysis (RM) is the etiology in 7-10% of cases of AKI and benefits from early, aggressive volume repletion. RM as an etiology of AKI is often missed in clinical setting as it requires specific diagnostic testing (CK testing). We evaluated various criteria that could be applied to urinalysis (UA) to identify individuals at elevated likelihood of RM. Methods: A retrospective electronic chart review of adult inpatients hospitalized at the Yale New Haven Hospital was performed between January 2020-December 2022. A total of 16 screening criteria were formulated using combinations of heme (≥1+, ≥ 2+, ≥ 3+, and ≥ 4+) and RBCs (≤5, ≤10, ≤20, and ≤30) per high power field (HPF) thresholds from the closest UA prior to AKI. The accuracy was assessed using post-AKI CK&gt;1000 U/L as the definition of rhabdomyolysis diagnosis. Results: A total of 12,273 patients were included of which 20.5% patients had serum CK levels checked after AKI. Of those, 222 (8.8%) met the diagnostic criteria for rhabdomyolysis. The median time from laboratory AKI diagnosis to CK measurement was 2.7 (0.9-6.5) days. UA criterion 1.4 (≥1 heme and ≤30 RBCs) met by 35.1% demonstrated the highest sensitivity for rhabdomyolysis. UA criterion 3.1 (≥ 3+ heme and ≤5 RBCs) met by 2.0% demonstrated a specificity of 96.7% and sensitivity of 16.7% included the highest proportion of patients with CK measurement (45.3%), and more than a quarter of those tested had levels consistent with rhabdomyolysis. Conclusions: Rhabdo-suspected patients with greater heme/RBC discrepancy on UA were more likely to be tested for serum CK levels and diagnosed with rhabdo. CK testing was uncommon under all definitions, suggesting missed rhabdomyolysis cases. Automated electronic screening of UA parameters with clinical decision support to order CK may be a viable mechanism to increase the diagnosis of rhabdo among AKI patients.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although adverse reactions and injuries associated with blood donation are typically self-sustaining, they may defer donors from making future blood donations. AIMS: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and predictors of adverse reactions in whole blood donors, thereby identifying potential targets for interventions to reduce such events. METHODS: A total of 5,003 whole blood donations were analyzed over a two-year period. Donor demographic, medical, and biometric parameters were recorded and examined for associations with adverse donor reactions. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of vasovagal reactions was 1.7% and 287 donors (5.74%) experienced adverse events (AEs). Strong predictors of adverse reactions included younger age, first-time donation, low body weight, donation around noon, and a pre-donation waiting period exceeding 30 minutes. Vasovagal reaction rates reported in the literature vary widely, ranging from 0.09% to 2.24%. Most studies, including the present one, found no significant gender differences in reaction rates; in this study, males and females experienced almost similar rates (1.7% vs. 1.8%). CONCLUSION: These findings are instrumental in identifying donors at greater danger of developing undesirable reactions. Enhanced monitoring during and after donation, along with timely intervention, may facilitate to prevent many of these adverse and unpleasant events and improve donor retention.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Maximum Surgical Blood Order Schedule (MSBOS) is a table of elective surgical procedures which lists the number of red cell units routinely cross-matched for them preoperatively. The goal of the MSBOS is to establish realistic blood ordering levels for certain procedures as there are variations in the surgical requirements of institutions. The preoperative blood requests frequently exceed the actual number of units needed for transfusion. The aim of this study was to observe the blood utilization in elective gastrointestinal surgeries in our hospital over a 1-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An institute-based observational study was conducted among patients who underwent elective surgeries under the department of general surgery for gastrointestinal surgical indication over a period of 1 year. The number of units requested, cross-matched, and transfused along with the number of patients cross-matched and transfused were collected. Crossmatch-to-transfusion ratio, transfusion probability, and transfusion index were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 382 patients underwent 16 different elective procedures, and among these, blood was requested for 347 patients. The number of red blood cell units which were cross-matched for these patients was 721, and out of which, 577 units were transfused to 326 patients. The overall C: T ratio ranged from 1 to 1.34, T% ranged from 88% to 100%, and TI ranged from 1 to 3. All these values were found to be within the acceptable range and indicated adequate blood ordering and utilization pattern. Based on these indices, MSBOS was formulated for each procedure. CONCLUSION: The study indicated an adequate overall ratio of C: T ratio, T%, and TI. Developing a blood ordering schedule (MSBOS), to guide the clinicians regarding blood usage can optimize over-ordering of blood, thereby reducing unwarranted compatibility testing, returning unused blood, and wastage due to expiry of the blood units.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transfusion Medicine (TM) receives varying degrees of attention within undergraduate medical curricula. Effective teaching methods can enhance knowledge of TM among medical students. This study evaluates the effectiveness of peer teaching as a method for improving TM understanding among second-year MBBS students (Phase II medical students as per Competency-based Medical Education-CBME Curriculum). METHODOLOGY: A questionnaire-based descriptive study was conducted among 334 second-year MBBS students. Nine peer teachers were selected and assigned TM topics. Learners were assessed pre- and post-peer teaching sessions. Structured feedback was collected from both learners and peer teachers. Following peer teaching sessions, TM faculty conducted recap sessions. RESULTS: A total of 334 second-year MBBS students participated in four peer teaching sessions. The mean presession assessment score was 4.31, which significantly increased to 6.19 postsession. Most students (88.59%) found the sessions enjoyable and motivating, with many (48.93%) indicating a desire to teach in the future. A significant majority of peer teachers felt well-prepared, but also expressed stress and the need for better preparation. All peer teachers reported enhanced learning and confidence. Key strengths of peer teaching included self-directed learning, enjoyment, and interactivity. A common area for improvement was better preparation. CONCLUSION: Peer teaching significantly enhanced short-term knowledge of TM among the participating medical students, as evidenced by a substantial increase in postsession assessment scores. The study demonstrates that students found these sessions engaging and that the peer teachers benefited from the experience by gaining confidence and reinforcing their own learning. This study suggests that peer teaching could be a valuable supplementary tool for improving student engagement and knowledge acquisition in specific medical topics like TM.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Platelet donation, vital for critical patients, often faces neglect and shortages. Apheresis donation, though time-intensive, is crucial in modern therapy. For successful awareness drives to promote platelet donation, effective doctor communication and addressing donor concerns are needed. This study analyzes factors influencing platelet donation intentions in medical students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was conducted at a tertiary health center in North India. A structured questionnaire was given to 400 undergraduate medical students to assess their knowledge, attitude, and practice with respect to platelet donations, followed by platelet awareness drive to educate students. Postintervention assessment was done using the same questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done using the SPSS software. RESULTS: Out of 400 participants, 62.3% were unaware of platelet apheresis donation. Preawareness drive, 55.2% were willing to donate, which increased to 64% postdrive, showing a significant difference. Awareness of donation safety rose from 46.2% to 78.7%, and knowledge of eligibility criteria improved from 13.8% to 73.5%, both statistically significant. Most participants (93%) believed awareness drives motivate society, with a slight increase to 94.5% postdrive. Willingness to register as donors increased significantly from 38.5% to 49.5% after the intervention. CONCLUSION: Undergraduate medical students showed significant improvement in their knowledge about platelet apheresis after an awareness drive, with most displaying a positive attitude towards donations. Improving access to donation opportunities and creating awareness could encourage more people to donate platelet.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: BACKGROUND: India faces a growing challenge of an increasing stray dog population and bite incidents, leading to donor deferrals. As incidence of bite-related deferrals is rapidly rising among the top primary causes of temporary donor deferrals, this trend poses a risk to an already constrained donor pool. Deferrals frequently lead to donor attrition, hence, understanding its impact is critical for blood supply management. AIMS: To analyze prevalence, trends, and impact of antirabies vaccination (ARV) following animal bite-related donor deferrals in a tertiary care hospital blood center in Delhi from January 2021 to April 2025. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective observational study conducted on blood donor deferrals due to ARV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were extracted from donor screening logs and compared with hospital emergency room/outpatient departments (ER/OPD) records of patients postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) with ARV during the same period. Trends in ARV-related deferrals were calculated and compared with % PEP-ARV cases in ER/OPD. RESULTS: During this period, 68,296 donors registered at our blood center, of whom 7094 (10.4%) were deferred for not meeting eligibility criteria. Among these, 528 (7.7%) were temporarily deferred due to ARV. The ARV-related deferral rate showed an alarming rise of 189.5% (3.8% in 2021–11% by April 2025), correlating with the rising number of PEP-ARV cases in the ER/OPD. Notably, only 1.32% of these returned for subsequent donation, indicating substantial donor attrition. CONCLUSION: ARV-related deferrals are rising and significantly impacting donor retention. Revising deferral policies, enhancing public awareness, and integrating bite surveillance with donor data are essential to maintain the blood supply and address this growing concern.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Wilms tumor (WT), also known as nephroblastoma, is the most common pediatric renal malignancy. We present the case of a 1-year-old female child who presented with prolonged fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms, later found to have a left renal mass. Imaging and histopathology confirmed a WT with diffuse anaplasia and rhabdomyoblastic differentiation. The patient was managed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical nephrectomy with lymph node dissection. The patient progressed with metastasis to the lung highlights the significance of genetic evaluation in recurrent WT, particularly the identification of a heterozygous RECQL3/BLM (OMIM#210900) gene mutation, which may contribute to tumorigenesis and recurrence risk, and has potential implications for prognosis. Notably, genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous pathogenic variant in the BLM gene, traditionally linked to Bloom syndrome (BS), a disorder characterized by genomic instability and cancer predisposition in the homozygous condition. Despite the absence of classical clinical features of BS, such as short stature, photosensitivity, immunodeficiency, and a characteristic facial rash, this mutation may have contributed to tumorigenesis by providing a fertile environment for the development of other mutations, highlighting the potential role of monoallelic BLM variants in pediatric malignancies. This rare combination of aggressive WT histology and BLM heterozygosity emphasises the critical importance of integrating molecular diagnostics into pediatric oncology. Our findings emphasize personalized risk assessment and targeted surveillance strategies to improve outcomes in complex pediatric renal tumors.",

    "Abstract": "&lt;div&gt;In class 8 semi-trucks, the hydraulic steering gear and torque overlay system are critical components affecting the steering feel design and vehicle control. Transitioning from traditional hydraulic gears to hydraulic gears with torque overlay steering (TOS) systems for increased enhancement of driver comfort is beneficial but has also resulted in drawbacks for on-center steer feel, especially at high vehicle speeds (60+ km/h). This article evaluates the impact of three design mechanisms within hydraulic steering gears of a TOS system that have shown improvement in on-center performance for traditional hydraulic gears. The study compares a standard assembly of TOS, i.e., baseline, and a design-optimized ideal prototype, to evaluate the effectiveness of the three design mechanisms: valve curve performance, on-center friction, and torsion bar stiffness. The two samples underwent high-speed vehicle testing to gather driver feedback and assess potential enhancements to the on-center steering feel. The final design changes on the ideal prototype were based on the best valve curve and on-center friction, as limitations in the torsion bar modification process precluded its use in the vehicle. The vehicle qualification team found insufficient evidence linking these design features to improved overall steering performance. Further research will be conducted to analyze the impact of torsion bar change as well as software controller performance within the TOS as a follow-up study.&lt;/div&gt;",

In particular, relevant aspects of the discrete ordinates approximation of the model are highlighted for neutron and photon transport applications, including nuclear safeguards, nuclear reactor shielding problems, and optical tomography. In addition, a short discussion of rarefied gas dynamics problems, relevant, for instance, to the study of micro-electro-mechanical systems, and their connection with the Linearized Boltzmann Equation, is presented. A primary goal of the work is to establish as much as possible the connections between the different phenomena described by the model and the versatility of the analytical methodology, the ADO method, in providing concise and accurate solutions, which are fundamental for numerical simulations.",

    "Abstract": "Importance: Psychosocial well-being during pregnancy influences maternal health and adjustment to motherhood. Targeted interventions may enhance emotional resilience and occupational functioning. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of Maternal Role Preparation Training (MRPT) and Awareness-Centered Occupational Therapy (ACOT) on anxiety, depression, coping styles, emotion regulation, and quality of life (QoL) in pregnant women. Design: Three-arm randomized controlled trial. Setting: Hospital obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Türkiye. Participants: Healthy pregnant women in their second trimester (N = 74) who met inclusion criteria. Intervention: Participants were assigned to MRPT (n = 23), ACOT (n = 23), or the control group (n = 28). Group sessions occurred 2×/wk for 8 wk. Assessments were conducted at pretest (second trimester), posttest (third trimester), and 12-wk postpartum follow-up. Kruskal–Wallis (KW) and Friedman tests were used. MRPT targeted maternal role development, and ACOT emphasized self-awareness in daily occupations; both followed manualized protocols. Outcomes and Measures: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Styles of Coping With Stress Scale, Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and Nottingham Health Profile. Results: ACOT significantly reduced anxiety (χ2 = 31.97, p &amp;lt; .01), improved emotion regulation, and enhanced QoL (KW = 43.55; p &amp;lt; .001). MRPT was more effective in reducing depression (χ2 = 17.73, p &amp;lt; .01) and promoting adaptive coping. Both interventions reduced maladaptive strategies. Pain and sleep gains lessened at follow-up. Conclusions and Relevance: ACOT is superior for anxiety, emotion regulation, and QoL; MRPT more effectively supports depression and coping. Occupational therapists may select approaches on the basis of individual psychosocial profiles during pregnancy. Plain-Language Summary: This study explored how two different occupational therapy programs helped pregnant women improve their emotional well-being. One program helped participants prepare for the maternal role with education and group discussions; the other program used activities that supported body awareness and emotional self-regulation. Women who took part in the awareness-based sessions had less anxiety and felt more in control of their emotions. Those in the maternal role group showed less depression and coped with stress more effectively. Both programs helped improve quality of life. These results suggest that occupational therapy can support emotional health during pregnancy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Past temperature reconstructions offer valuable insights into the impact of climate change on the global climate-human-vegetation system. Branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are recognized as effective temperature proxies, particularly in lakes and peatlands, where they are well preserved. However, their reliability as palaeothermometers can be compromised by factors beyond air temperature, especially in drylands. This study investigates the recently compiled Arid Central Asian (ACA) brGDGT surface Data Base, a regional dataset consisting of 753 surface samples from the drylands of ACA. The distribution of brGDGTs in relation to climate and environmental variables was analysed to explore their potential as reliable temperature proxies, mainly focusing on brGDGTs methylation (MBT), cyclisation (CBT), and isomer (IR) indices. The brGDGT-based palaeothermometer is a promising tool for understanding past climates, but our comparison between an ACA-centred database and a worldwide continental surface sample database reveals several challenges. Drylands exhibit extreme climate and soil/lacustrine properties, amplifying the impact of confounding factors on brGDGT-based relationships with mean annual air temperature. Salinity emerges as the dominant factor influencing brGDGT variance, followed by sample type, pH, and aridity, all of which contribute significantly. These factors interact in complex ways, with the salinity effect varying between soil and lacustrine deposits. For sample physicochemical conditions, the IR6+7Me′ index is best for salinity, and IR6Me is most suitable for pH reconstruction. Thus, the MBT5Me′-temperature relationship is limited in ACA, particularly for lacustrine samples, and MBT6Me′ does not offer a better solution under hyper- to semi-arid conditions. Sub-calibrating models for specific environmental conditions such as salinity and aridity improves the accuracy of temperature reconstructions. Furthermore, the difference between MBT5Me′ and MBT6Me′ provides a promising proxy to assess aridity. Although the brGDGT signal in drylands is influenced by multiple controlling factors, it remains a valuable tool for understanding past climate and environmental conditions, especially when accounting for the complex interactions between these factors based on each study's unique physicochemical and bioclimatic context. Further research, incorporating a broader range of surface samples alongside comprehensive soil and climate data, holds the potential to enhance the accuracy of brGDGT-based climate reconstructions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Potential self-perpetuating dieback of the Amazon rain forest has been a topic of concern. The concern is that initial deforestation could critically impair the forest’s water recycling capacities, further harming the remaining forest through reduced annual precipitation. Many studies have focused on annual mean precipitation changes, due to its widespread perception as a central control on the Amazon rain forest’s stability. However, the impact of deforestation goes beyond changes in the annual mean precipitation. Yet, global coarse-resolution climate models are not well suited to investigate changes in short-duration and localized events due to their coarse resolution. Here, we circumvent these issues by analyzing a full-deforestation scenario simulated by a global storm-resolving model. We focus on changes in the tail of the hourly distribution of precipitation, temperature, and wind. Hourly precipitation becomes more extreme in the absence of the forest than in an intact forest, with an increased occurrence of both no rain and intense rainfall. These changes are driven by enhanced moisture convergence that strengthens vertical velocity. On average, the near-surface temperature rises significantly by about 3.84 °C, and the daily minimum temperature after deforestation becomes similar to the daily maximum temperature before deforestation. Except for wet-bulb temperature, human heat stress indicators shift to more severe levels, with implications for health and a significant reduction in work productivity. Finally, the mean 10 m wind speed intensifies by a factor of four, with the 99th percentile wind speed doubling. To summarize, our findings, while based on an idealized case, provide a stark warning of the effects of continuing deforestation of the Amazon.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. We developed the WULFFSS, a stochastic monthly gridded forest-fire model for the western United States (US). Operating at 12 km resolution, WULFFSS calculates monthly probabilities of fires that burn at least 100 ha of forest area as well as the forest area burned per fire. The model is forced by variables related to vegetation, topographic, anthropogenic, and climate factors, organized into three indices representing spatial, annual-cycle, and lower frequency temporal domains. These indices can interact, so variables promoting fire in one domain amplify fire-promoting effects in another. Fire probability and size models use multiple logistic and linear regression, respectively, and can be easily updated as new data or ideas emerge. During its training period of 1985–2024, WULFFSS captures 71 % and 86 % of observed interannual variability in western US forest-fire frequency and area, respectively. It reproduces regional differences in seasonal timing, frequencies, and sizes of fires, and performs well in cross-validation exercises that test the model's accuracy in years or regions not considered during model training. While lacking fine-scale fire dynamics, use of classic statistics promotes interpretability and efficient ensemble generation. Designed to run within a vegetation ecosystem model, bidirectional feedbacks between vegetation and fire can identify how ecosystem changes have altered or will alter fire-climate relationships across the western US. The model's predictive power should improve with increasingly accurate and extensive observational data, and its approach can be extended to other regions. Here we provide a thorough description of the WULFFSS model, including the motivation underlying its development, caveats to our approach, and areas for future improvement.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Merging physics-based with data-driven approaches in hybrid hydrological modeling offers new opportunities to enhance predictive accuracy while addressing challenges of model interpretability and fidelity. Traditional hydrological models, developed using physical principles, are easily interpretable but often limited by their rigidity and assumptions. In contrast, machine learning methods, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, offer exceptional predictive performance but are often criticized for their black-box nature. Hybrid models aim to reconcile these approaches by imposing physics to constrain and understand what the ML part of the model does. This study introduces a quantitative metric based on Information Theory to evaluate the relative contributions of physics-based and data-driven components in hybrid models. Through synthetic examples and a large-sample case study, we examine the role of physics-based conceptual constraints: can we actually call the hybrid model “physics-constrained”, or does the data-driven component overwrite these constraints for the sake of performance? We test this on the arguably most constrained form of hybrid models, i.e., we prescribe structures of typical conceptual hydrological models and allow an LSTM to modify only its parameters over time, as learned during training against observed discharge data. Our findings indicate that performance predominantly relies on the data-driven component, with the physics-constraint often adding minimal value or even making the prediction problem harder. This observation challenges the assumption that integrating physics should enhance model performance by informing the LSTM. Even more alarming, the data-driven component is able to avoid (parts of) the conceptual constraint by driving certain parameters to insensitive constants or value sequences that effectively cancel out certain storage behavior. Our proposed approach helps to analyse such conditions in-depth, which provides valuable insights into model functioning, case study specifics, and the power or problems of prior knowledge prescribed in the form of conceptual constraints. Notably, our results also show that hybrid modeling may offer hints towards parsimonious model representations that capture dominant physical processes, but avoid illegitimate constraints. Overall, our framework can (1) uncover the true role of constraints in presumably “physics-constrained” machine learning, and (2) guide the development of more accurate representations of hydrological systems through careful evaluation of the utility of expert knowledge to tackle the prediction problem at hand.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. This paper analyses the effects of several typical polygon amplitudes and orders on wheel sound radiation in metro lines using the finite-element method (FEM) and the boundary element method (BEM). A vehicle–rail coupled rolling contact model incorporating wheel polygons is established, and the wheel–rail forces under different polygon amplitudes and orders are obtained. The corresponding wheel sound radiation results are also obtained. The results demonstrate that the model accurately reflects the impact of polygons on wheel–rail forces. Polygons increase inter-wheel–rail forces, and higher polygon orders result in greater wheel–rail forces for both standard and resilient wheels. However, the wheel–rail forces do not exhibit a linear relationship with polygon amplitude. Furthermore, the noise reduction mechanism of resilient wheels is thoroughly explained in terms of damping, energy dissipation, vibration isolation, decoupling, and acoustic impedance characteristics. By changing the polygon amplitude, order, and track line, it was found that, within the 400–5000 Hz frequency range, the higher the polygon orders, the higher the sound pressure level (SPL) for two types of wheels. Polygon amplitudes differ, with the resilient wheels radiating SPL 2–13 dB(A) lower than the standard wheels in the 2500–5000 Hz frequency range. No significant linear relationships were found between the polygon amplitude and the SPL of the two types of wheels in most frequency bands. Additionally, the SPL of the resilient wheels is 3–10 dB(A) lower than that of the standard wheels in the 2500–5000 Hz band under curve conditions. Moreover, under curve conditions the rubber layer of the resilient wheels reduces the SPL at a high speed and frequency.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. Accurately reconstructing past changes to the shape and volume of the Antarctic ice sheet relies on the use of physically based and thus internally consistent ice sheet modeling, benchmarked against spatially limited geologic data. The challenge in model benchmarking against geologic data is diagnosing whether model-data misfits are the result of an inadequate model, inherently noisy or biased geologic data, and/or incorrect association between modeled quantities and geologic observations. In this work we address this challenge by (i) the development and use of a new model-data evaluation framework applied to an uncurated data set of geologic constraints, and (ii) nested high-spatial-resolution modeling designed to test the hypothesis that model resolution is an important limitation in matching geologic data. While previous approaches to model benchmarking employed highly curated datasets, our approach applies an automated screening and quality control algorithm to an uncurated public dataset of geochronological observations (specifically, cosmogenic-nuclide exposure-age measurements from glacial deposits in ice-free areas). This optimizes data utilization by including more geological constraints, reduces potential interpretive bias, and allows unsupervised assimilation of new data as they are collected. We also incorporate a nested model framework in which high-resolution domains are downscaled from a continent-wide ice sheet model. We highlight the application of this framework by applying these methods to a small ensemble of deglacial ice-sheet model simulations, and demonstrate that the nested approach improves the ability of model simulations to match exposure age data collected from areas of complex topography and ice flow. We develop a range of diagnostic model-data comparison metrics to provide more insight into model performance than possible from a single-valued misfit statistic, showing that different metrics capture different aspects of ice sheet deflation.",

    "Abstract": "Exercise is a well-established non-pharmacological intervention with wide-ranging benefits for human health. Among its many physiological effects, exercise exerts significant immunomodulatory functions, particularly influencing monocyte and macrophage activity. In this review, we summarize current findings on how acute and chronic exercise of varying modalities affect monocyte/macrophage mobilization, polarization, and function. We also discuss the implications of these changes in the context of exercise-mediated protection against inflammatory, metabolic, oncologic, neurodegenerative, and musculoskeletal diseases. Furthermore, we highlight emerging mechanisms through which exercise modulates monocyte/macrophage biology, including the roles of exerkines, neuroendocrine signaling, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). A better understanding of these pathways may offer new insights into the development of exercise-based strategies for immune regulation and disease intervention.",

I briefly comment on the links between UNESCO's Open Science Recommendations paper (2021) and Robert Merton's CUDOS principles that describe and prescribe good ways of doing science (1942). I talk at some length about my own work (with Dr. Halil Kilicoglu and others) on self-acknowledgment of limitations and connect that to the question of how we may organize skepticism (the 'OS' in CUDOS) in our research teams). I distinguish four types of limitations and link the types 3 and 4 to multiverse sensitivity analysis, a radical form of testing the robustness of study findings. Finally, I spend 10 minutes on the results of a small study we did at our open science support desk to find out to what extent our faculty's researchers embraced the 14 principles of our internal open science checklist between 2020 and 2023. The last slide discusses slow science, team science and again the organization of skepticism within research settings.",

    "Abstract": "Cattell–Horn–Carroll models of intelligence frequently show that, at the group-factor level, G f is most strongly related to g , whereas at the subtest level, G c -associated measures exhibit the highest g loadings. One proposed solution to this “ g paradox” holds that Stratum-III g and Stratum-II G f are identical, and that the sizeable g loadings of crystallized subtests merely reflect the investment of G f into learning. Investment theory is weakly evidenced, however. We argue that the “ g paradox” results from subtests measuring facets of G f exhibiting pronounced specificity for cognitive entities. Capturing everything that goes into G f is difficult on a single-measure basis, hence lower Stratum-I g loadings. The G f group factor is nonetheless reflective of the composite of these entities and therefore is uniquely (at Stratum II) associated with g . Subtests measuring G c broadly index the quality of global systems involving many cognitive processes, not entities, and so relate to factors that have formative effects on g , which are Stratum-I specific. We posit the existence of two distinguishable sources of general covariance: a formative g (associated primarily with G c ) and a reflective g (associated primarily with G f ), with the latter hierarchically superordinate to the former. Network analysis of “pure” psychometric measures of the G c and G f domains indicates that the former exhibits significantly greater network integrity than the latter, consistent with this formative/reflective model. Random effects meta-analysis of SEM contrast parameters, derived from four large genetically informed studies, finds that subtests assigned to a “ G c ” category are associated with higher-magnitude direct (formative) genetic paths relative to those in a “ G f ” category, suggesting a weak but discriminable and broad Stratum-I g in the residual covariance structure. Given the theorized phylogenetic histories of these two g s, we term the formative (“bottom-up”) g “proto g ” ( g p ), and the reflective (“top-down”) g “neo g ” ( g n ).",

    "Abstract": "Even seemingly homogeneous populations of cells can express phenotypic diversity in response to environmental changes. Thus, X-ray irradiation of tissues composed of diverse cell types can have complex outcomes. We have used single-cell RNA sequencing to study the effects of X-ray radiation on the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, a relatively simple tissue composed mostly of epithelial cells. Transcriptomic clustering of cells collected from the wing disc generates clusters that are mainly grouped based on proximodistal cell location. To quantify heterogeneity of gene expression among clusters, we adapted a metric used to study market concentration, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. Genes involved in DNA damage repair, defense against reactive oxygen species, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis are expressed relatively uniformly. In contrast, genes encoding a subset of ligands, notably cytokines that activate the JAK/STAT pathway, some transcription factors, including Ets21C , previously implicated in regeneration, and several signaling proteins are expressed more regionally. Though the radiation-responsive transcription factor p53 is expressed relatively uniformly in the wing disc, several regionally induced genes still require p53 function, indicating that regional and radiation-induced factors combine to regulate their expression. We also examined heterogeneity within regions using a clustering approach based on cell cycle gene expression. A subpopulation of cells, characterized by high levels of tribbles expression, is amplified in irradiated discs. Remarkably, this subpopulation accounts for a considerable fraction of radiation-induced gene expression, indicating that cellular responses are non-uniform even within regions. Thus, both inter-regional and intra-regional heterogeneity are important features of tissue responses to X-ray radiation.",

    "Abstract": "We present a comparative study of ensemble and deep learning architectures for multi-label, multi-level Arabic fake news detection on the JoNewsFake dataset, a dataset of 50,000 Facebook posts from 12 verified Jordanian news agencies annotated with 22 main categories, ~75 subcategories, and Fake/Real labels. The models include Random Forest, Extra Trees, LightGBM, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) + Bi-LSTM, CNN + Bi-GRU, and a Transformer encoder. All systems use a hybrid representation that concatenates AraBERT semantic embeddings, POS-based syntactic features, and emotion indicators (894 dimensions). Extra Trees yields the strongest overall performance with a Macro F1-score of ≈0.95 (Main), ≈0.98 (Sub), and ≈0.95 (Fake/Real), while the Transformer achieves a Subcategory Macro F1-score of ≈0.93, suggesting that self-attention offers benefits for fine-grained label spaces. We provide a clear account of data collection, filtering, annotation, and evaluation to support reproducibility. The findings show that carefully engineered features paired with efficient ensembles remain highly competitive for Arabic news, whereas Transformer encoders excel when hierarchical granularity increases. This work offers a rigorous, data-driven baseline for Arabic fake news detection across multiple classification levels and can guide future extensions ( e.g ., cross-dialect coverage and cross-platform validation).",

    "Abstract": "Background Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been reported to enhance explosive strength in lower limb skeletal muscles. Nevertheless, findings regarding the impact of tDCS on jump performance remain inconclusive, potentially due to variations in stimulation montage and current intensity. Therefore, we aimed to elucidate the effects of multifocal tDCS on lower limb jump kinetics and neuromuscular adaptation. Methods Fourteen female collegiate basketball players were enrolled in a randomized, crossover, controlled trial. Each participant underwent three intervention sessions in a randomized sequence: 2 mA tDCS, 4 mA tDCS, and sham tDCS, all targeting the primary motor cortex (M1). After each stimulation session, countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), and surface electromyography (EMG) data were collected. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Results The 4 mA multifocal tDCS condition produced a significant increase in jump height compared to baseline, sham, and the 2 mA condition. Similarly, the concentric impulse was markedly higher in the 4 mA group relative to all other conditions. Relative peak force was significantly improved in the 4 mA group versus baseline, and relative peak power was significantly greater under 4 mA tDCS compared to sham stimulation. The modified reactive strength index (RSImod) was also enhanced considerably following 4 mA tDCS, relative to both baseline and sham conditions. However, EMG analysis indicated that none of the tDCS interventions significantly affected the root mean square (RMS) values of lower limb muscle activation, including the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus/semimembranosus (SEM), medial gastrocnemius (MG), lateral gastrocnemius (GL), and tibialis anterior (TA). Conclusion Multifocal anodal tDCS at an intensity of 4 mA significantly improves lower limb jump performance in female collegiate basketball athletes. Integrating multifocal anodal tDCS into routine training regimens may serve as a practical and effective adjunct for enhancing performance in this population.",

    "Abstract": "Background Tropomyosin 4 (TPM4) regulates neurite outgrowth and vascular pathology but its role as a biomarker for predicting outcomes in stroke patients is unclear. This study investigated the association between serum TPM4 levels and 1-year functional outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients. Methods AIS patients admitted within 24 h post-onset from the Chengdu Stroke Registry were included. Serum TPM4 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Poor functional outcomes were defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score &gt;2 at 1 year after stroke onset. Multivariate logistic regression assessed TPM4’s association with outcomes, with its predictive incremental value evaluated by discrimination, reclassification, and overall performance metrics. Results Among 181 patients (median age 66 years, 64.1% male), 59 (32.6%) experienced poor outcomes at 1 year, including 16 deaths (8.8%). Serum TPM4 levels on admission were negatively correlated with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ( r = −0.185, p = 0.013). Adjusted for confounders, lower serum TPM4 levels were independently associated with 1-year poor functional outcomes (adjusted OR 0.045, 95% CI [0.005–0.393], p = 0.005). Serum TPM4 levels had acceptable discriminative ability for predicting poor outcomes (AUROC 0.706, 95% CI [0.621–0.791], p &lt; 0.0001). Incorporating TPM4 into the basic model significantly improved the predictive power for poor functional outcomes (net reclassification index: 31.87%, p = 0.041; integrated discrimination improvement: 5.01%, p = 0.008; Brier score decreased from 0.16 to 0.15, p = 0.012). Conclusions Lower serum TPM4 levels on admission were independently associated with poor functional outcomes at 1 year in AIS patients, suggesting that TPM4 may serve as a potential biomarker for long-term outcomes and offer insights into its potential role in stroke pathophysiology. These findings need to be further verified in external cohorts.",
