    "Abstract": "Circadian clocks are conserved timekeeping systems present across the tree of life. Despite sequence divergence, their negative elements share biophysical traits such as intrinsic disorder, phosphorylation clusters, and charged low‐complexity regions, suggesting a shared functional logic beyond primary sequence. Using the fungal protein FREQUENCY (FRQ) as a proxy, we review how intrinsic disorder enables temporal regulation. Using computational analysis, we explore the hypothesis that multisite phosphorylation may incrementally reshape FRQ conformational ensemble, with potential consequences for partner engagement over the circadian day. Thus, in this review we consider how, despite poor sequence conservation, circadian negative elements maintain a conserved mechanism rooted in the physical principles of disorder and post‐translational modulation, positioning these properties at the very heart of the molecular chronosome .",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective Long‐read sequencing and optical genome mapping technologies have the ability to detect large and complex structural variants. This has led to the discovery of novel pathogenic variants in neurodegenerative movement disorders. Thus, we aimed to systematically compare the SV detection capabilities of OGM and ONT in Parkinson's disease. Methods Ultra‐high molecular weight DNA was derived from blood and fibroblast cultures of 19 patients with mostly early‐onset Parkinson's disease, and used for Nanopore sequencing and optical genome mapping. The size distributions of deletions and insertions were compared, and variants were filtered for rare or potentially pathogenic variants in 134 known movement disorder genes. Results Both methods identified SVs &gt; 50 kb; however, optical mapping identified fewer structural variants (49,677) compared to Nanopore sequencing (94,400), but detected six times more in the range 50–80 kb. In general, it detected significantly larger deletions and insertions ( p &lt; 2.2 × 10 −16 ). Both methods detected a benign intergenic deletion (195 kb) near ITPR1 , and optical mapping validated a previously published 7‐Mb PRKN inversion. Small heterozygous deletions in ATXN2 , SUCLA2 , and PNKD detected by optical mapping were identified to be intronic by Nanopore sequencing. No causal variants were identified in movement disorder genes. Interpretation Optical mapping can be a powerful first‐line method for detecting large structural variants, but it requires a high‐resolution method to refine breakpoint positions. Despite certain limitations, Nanopore sequencing was highly capable of detecting large variants independently and allows for a highly complementary assessment and validation of structural variation in combination with optical mapping.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT A significant hurdle for the clinical translation of in vivo surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) bioimaging is the scarcity of high‐brightness near‐infrared (NIR) contrast agents. To address this challenge, we develop such agents through the strategic optimization of gold nanorods (AuNRs) as plasmonic substrates and the selection of resonant Raman reporters. We quantitatively characterize the effective differential SERS cross‐section of nanoparticles comprising AuNRs spectrally encoded with various Raman reporters. Our findings establish that the spectral overlap between the AuNR plasmon resonance, reporter absorption, and laser excitation wavelength is a critical parameter for achieving high brightness. Guided by this principle, we engineer NIR‐I and NIR‐II SERS agents using optimized AuNRs and selected resonant reporters, encapsulated within cell membranes derived from 4T1 breast cancer cells. These agents exhibit superior brightness and specific homotypic targeting toward 4T1 cells. In vivo studies in mice demonstrate their capability for precise tumor margin delineation and sensitive detection of microtumors (&lt;100 µm) via NIR‐I and NIR‐II SERS imaging. Furthermore, the agents enable image‐guided surgical resection of orthotopic 4T1 tumors, achieving complete tumor removal and significantly improving surgical outcomes. This work provides a foundational strategy for designing high‐brightness NIR SERS contrast agents for advanced in vivo molecular imaging applications.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Additive manufacturing of multi‐principal element alloys is a promising approach for fabricating functional materials. A medium‐entropy alloy (MEA) composite was fabricated using micro‐scale laser powder bed fusion (µ‐LPBF) with nano‐ceramic particle doping, exhibiting a notable strength‐ductility synergy. The microstructural evolution, mechanical properties, and deformation mechanisms of the composite were systematically investigated. The unique µ‐LPBF process and subsequent aging treatment enabled the composite to exhibit good properties, including high hardness (557.5–789.1 HV), excellent tensile strength (1675 MPa), and uniform elongation (28%). Furthermore, the tensile strength was increased to 1817 M Pa via ceramic particle doping, without compromising the ductility at 18%. Ultra‐high temperature gradients and cooling rate in µ‐LPBF are conducive to grain refinement and the simultaneous activation of multiple strengthening mechanisms, thereby enhancing strain‐hardening and ductility. The enhanced performance of the MEA, including tensile strength, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance arise mainly from synergistic multi‐level microstructures, featuring segregation‐induced dislocation banding, ultrafine γ′ precipitates, Cr‐rich σ ‐phase precipitates with controlled fraction and morphology, dense 9R phase, high‐density dislocations, dense nanotwin/microband networks, Lomer‐Cottrell locks, and related crystallographic defects. The novel alloy design, combined with a streamlined, optimized processing strategy, plays a crucial role in developing multi‐component alloys and composites with outstanding mechanical properties.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Diamond, a wide‐bandgap material with unique electronic properties, has shown great promise as a photoreduction catalyst due to its ability to produce highly reductive solvated electrons. However, this requires deep UV illumination, which hampers its sustainable application for real‐world photocatalytic processes. Here, it is reported that the tailored introduction of suitable intra‐bandgap states in diamond can be achieved by functionalizing nanoscale detonation diamond with a ruthenium‐based photosensitizer. The nature of the electronic interaction between the diamond, its surface and the surface‐bound moieties is elucidated through X‐ray absorption, transient optical absorption, and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopies both in vacuum and water. The electron emission upon irradiation with visible light is enabled by the surface‐induced bangdap engineering. Solar‐light‐driven reduction of CO 2 to formate is performed as a proof‐of‐concept reaction. The potential for photoexcited electron transfer (PET) mediated photosensitization in reductive diamond catalysis opens the way for the application of surface‐engineered diamond as a sustainable photo(electro)catalyst.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT An electrostatic model, based on the well‐established charge equilibration method is presented, that allows for a fast prediction of partial atomic charges within non‐reactive force fields for metal–organic frameworks with typical elemental compositions. The required molecular information is inferred in a topological fashion, with generic topological bond lengths, based on experimental covalent radii of the contained elements. The model is parameterized on the basis of atom types, that encode the local atomic coordination environment up the nearest bonded neighbors. Consequently, the model is geometry‐independent, requiring only a graph representation of the molecular bonds, which is easily retrieved due to the explicit bond definitions in non‐reactive force fields. Therefore, by sacrificing the dependence of the atomic charges on changes in the system's geometry, the proposed model avoids the computation of distance matrices, increasing the overall performance. By parameterizing the model on three different atomic encoding levels of increasing parametric resolution, the model's accuracy is systematically increased. To this end, a global optimization scheme is employed, in which the model parameters of atomic width, electronegativity and hardness, are trained to reproduce a set of reference charges. These, were obtained from the QMOF database, which hosts electronic structure properties computed for over 20 000 MOFs and related materials. Curated subsets of the QMOF database were generated depending on the employed atom encoding scheme with a balanced atom type incidence. These subsets were used for the training and testing of the new model, containing atomic reference charges of around 10 000 MOFs for selected metallic species and with comparable relative atom type distributions between the sets. The model is able to predict charges with an accuracy below 0.02 e for the most detailed atom typing scheme for a wide chemical space without the need to to correct for charge neutrality.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have emerged as promising therapeutics for ulcerative colitis (UC) owing to their potent anti‐inflammatory effects and favorable biocompatibility. However, effective oral siRNA delivery remains challenging due to limited inflammatory cell targeting, inefficient endosomal escape, and rapid degradation in the gastrointestinal tract. To overcome these barriers, we developed a nano‐in‐micro modular microbead system for colon‐targeted delivery of siRNA against tumor necrosis factor‐α (TNF‐α). This platform integrates two key components: (i) a library of ginsenoside‐based lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) generated by screening natural sterol analogues, among which ginsenoside Rg3‐based LNPs (Rg3@siTNF‐α) were identified as optimal carriers, enabling enhanced macrophage targeting via glucose transporter‐1–mediated recognition and promoting endosomal escape by attenuating Niemann–Pick C1 (NPC1)–dependent recycling; and (ii) a calcium alginate (CA) shell that encapsulated Rg3@siTNF‐α to form microbeads (CA@Rg3@siTNF‐α), protecting the LNPs from premature degradation in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Upon colon‐specific dissolution, CA@Rg3@siTNF‐α released Rg3@siTNF‐α, facilitating efficient macrophage uptake, rapid endosomal escape, and lipase‐responsive siRNA release. Consequently, the microbeads alleviated UC by suppressing inflammation and oxidative stress, restoring epithelial barrier integrity, and rebalancing the gut microbiota. Collectively, this work presents a spatiotemporally controlled strategy for oral siRNA delivery with multi‐mechanistic therapeutic actions.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The linewidth of the Raman mode can directly provide insight into phonon lifetime, a critical parameter governing the thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials. Real crystals inherently deviate from ideal lattices due to isotopes, impurities, and defects, yet the explicit impact of these imperfections on non‐anharmonic phonon broadening remains elusive. Herein, temperature‐dependent Raman spectroscopy combined with first‐principles calculations unveils a significant temperature‐independent non‐anharmonic phonon broadening () in near‐ideal hBN‐encapsulated monolayer , primarily originating from isotopic mass disorder. Systematic studies on samples with progressively introduced defects further demonstrate that surface ripples, adsorbed impurities, and vacancies substantially contribute to in intralayer phonons. In contrast, interlayer shear modes in multilayer exhibit negligible sensitivity to uniform intralayer disorder, but are strongly affected by inhomogeneous interlayer imperfections. These findings establish a direct link between crystalline defects and non‐anharmonic phonon broadening, providing critical insights for phonon lifetime engineering and thermal management in functional semiconductor devices.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In the field of structural DNA nanotechnology, it is a significant technical challenge for a moving molecular machine to achieve desirable processivity to remain attached to the track during its operation. Herein, a non‐derailed three‐wheel driving DNA harvester (TW‐harvester) is demonstrated for quantitative evaluation of the malignant degree of tumor via imaging biomarker miRNA. The half‐time of TW‐harvester is 20.38 h, indicating substantially resistance to nuclease degradation. It circumvents the derailment event without sacrificing movement speed and persistently moves the surrounding spherical surface‐mediated track, achieving a high assay sensitivity and specificity for intracellular molecular imaging. The limit of detection (LOD) is 5.4 p m , and the interference from coexisting homologous miRNAs is substantially avoided. The miRNA assay results are consistent with the gold standard qPCR assay, and cell imaging sensitivity is significantly better than the well‐known FISH technique. The evaluation of cell proliferation is in good agreement with CCK‐8 assay and Wound‐healing assay, indicating the reliable information on tumor malignancy degree. Overall, the TW‐harvester could be used to quantitatively estimate the proliferation, migration, and malignant degree of tumor cells, thereby holding great application prospects in predicting the tumorigenesis, metastasis, recurrence, and outcomes during cancer management and treatment.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Controlling the supramolecular alignment of columnar mesogens offers a strategy to optimize charge transport and orientation of the transition dipole moment of emissive solution‐processed films, ultimately enabling the fabrication of more efficient solution‐processable OLEDs. Here, we report the development of multi‐resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescent (MR‐TADF) discotic liquid crystals (DLCs) containing a diindolocarbazole emissive core that is decorated with four mesogenic groups that are either branched ( DICz‐DMOC ) or linear ( DICz‐DOD ) in nature. DICz‐DMOC adopts a columnar mesophase at room temperature, where the neat film shows homeotropic alignment to the substrate surface. Emission is broad and partially quenched as neat films due to the formation of aggregates, while in toluene and as 10 wt.% doped films in mCP, emission originates mainly from monomolecular species. The DLCs align horizontally, which also orients the transition dipole moment of the emitters preferentially horizontally, reflected in an anisotropy factor, a , of 0.22 for the solution‐processed neat films. Solution‐processed OLEDs (SP‐OLEDs) containing DICz‐DMOC as the emitter showed a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE max ) of 10.0% in doped devices and 5.3% in non‐doped devices, representing some of the highest device efficiencies using emitters bearing mesogenic groups.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Antiferroelectrics are promising for high‐energy‐density storage owing to their characteristic double hysteresis loops. However, their performance is severely limited by their antiferroelectricity instability, low breakdown strength, and high hysteretic loss. This study proposes a performance optimization strategy based on polymorphic polar order engineering. By the introduction of LaScO 3 nonpolar end‐member into antiferroelectric PbHfO 3 , the long‐range antipolar orders were disrupted and thus establish a polymorphic polar configuration, combining short‐range antipolar orders and disordered nonpolar regions. This structure, directly observed via atomic‐scale scanning transmission electron microscopy, simultaneously delays the antiferroelectric‐ferroelectric phase transition field, depresses the field‐induced hysteretic loss, and improves the breakdown field. Consequently, the optimized polymorphic PbHfO 3 −based relaxor antiferroelectric achieves a high energy density of 100.3 J cm − 3 and efficiency of 76.3%, rivaling the advanced antiferroelectrics. Moreover, the films demonstrate exceptional stability under a broad temperature (−100°C to 200°C) and frequency (1–100 kHz) ranges, as well as extended cycling (up to 10 8 cycles). This work not only elucidates the microscopic mechanism of polymorphic polar order in optimizing antiferroelectric energy storage performance but also provides a novel design strategy for antiferroelectrics that integrates high energy density, high efficiency, and superior reliability.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Constructing sulfur vacancies (S v ) on monolayer MXene to modulate the valence states of metal sites, elucidating the underlying mechanisms responsible for the multiphase Fenton‐like catalytic process, is of critical importance. Motivated by this inspiration, we pathbreakingly applied elemental regulation and defect engineering on monolayer MXene, with CoS collaboration, aiming to construct S v to modulate the valence of Co sites in CoS and thereby enhance the catalytic performance toward PMS activation. Monolayer MXene incorporation effectively suppressed CoS aggregation, while sulfidation followed by calcination at 300°C created S v on the MXene surface, denoted as S v ‐CM. This regulation significantly boosted PMS activation and promoted the formation of highly reactive high‐valent metal‐oxo species (HVMS). Achieving complete bisphenol A (BPA) degradation within 5 min, the S v ‐CM/PMS system outperforms most previously reported heterogeneous catalyst/PMS systems. This highly efficient catalytic oxidation process converts BPA into low‐toxicity products via HVMS. Furthermore, the S v ‐CM/PMS system demonstrated excellent durability, maintaining 100% BPA removal over 72 h of continuous operation. This study provides valuable insights into the rational design of S v ‐CM and paves the way for its practical implementation for the Fenton‐like catalytic process and water purification.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT A major challenge in developing high‐temperature polymer dielectrics is the difficulty in simultaneously achieving a high dielectric constant, a wide bandgap ( E g ), and a high glass transition temperature ( T g ). To address this challenge, this study designed and synthesized a series of polynorbornene imides with methyl groups at the para position and substituents of varying steric hindrance and electronegativity (F, Cl, Br, CF 3 ) at the meta position from the perspective of molecular side‐chain configuration. Molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations reveal that the steric hindrance of meta ‐substituents can regulate the side‐chain configuration ratio in polymers. Specifically, as the substituent steric hindrance increases, the proportion of the isotactic configuration decreases while the syndiotactic configuration increases. The isotactic configuration enhances the polarization performance by strengthening the local dipole moment and the syndiotactic configuration improves insulation by increasing free volume and suppressing charge migration. The meta ‐chloro‐substituted PNIM‐Cl achieves a balance between isotactic and syndiotactic configurations through its moderate steric hindrance and electronegativity and results a high dielectric constant (4.04), a wide E g (4.27 eV), and an elevated T g (231.8°C). Consequently, the PNIM dielectric achieves remarkable discharged energy densities of 11.4 J cm − 3 at 150°C and 6.4 J cm − 3 at 200°C.",

Experimental analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that the Ohmic contact interface can induce interfacial charge redistribution, which optimizes the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates in the HER process. Consequently, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer (AEMWE) assembled with Re 3 P 4 /ReS 2 achieves a low cell voltage of 2.01 V at 1.0 A cm −2 and maintains stable operation for 500 h at an industrial current density of 500 mA cm −2 . This work provides valuable insight into designing Ohmic contact heterostructures as pH‐universal electrocatalysts, advancing the development of efficient hydrogen production technologies under diverse electrolyte conditions.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Among available cathode materials of sodium ion batteries (SIBs), the sodium layered transition metal oxides (Na x TMO 2 ) stand out owing to their high specific capacity and suitable working voltage. However, they are commonly plagued by lattice collapse, irreversible phase transition, and poor air stability, which severely limit their cycle durability and rate capability. To address the persistent challenges of Na x TMO 2 , structural regulation strategies based on the pillar and pinning effects have emerged as effective approaches. The ions serving as pillars in the alkali metal layer can expand the interslab spacing and strengthen interlayer interactions, thus constructing efficient Na + migration pathways and establishing a robust lattice framework. Similarly, the pinning ions in the TM and/or alkali metal layers acting as nails help to stabilize phase configuration, especially in deeply sodiated and desodiated states. Both pillar and pinning effects are extensively employed to optimize the structural stability, phase evolution behavior, and electrochemical properties of Na x TMO 2 . This review systematically summarizes recent advances in Na x TMO 2 regulated by pillar and pinning effects, primarily focusing on their construction approaches and underlying enhancement mechanisms. Finally, we outline the ongoing challenges and future research directions for Na x TMO 2 modified by the pillar or pinning effects.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The electrocatalytic nitrogen oxidation reaction (eNOR) offers a sustainable route for nitrate (NO 3 ‒ ) synthesis, yet its practical application is limited by sluggish intermediate formation kinetics. Although •OH generated during water oxidation can promote the formation of the key * NOH intermediate, the cooperative mechanism between •OH and catalytic sites remains insufficiently understood. Herein, a spin‐state modulation strategy is proposed to enhance * NOH generation under simulated solar irradiation, thereby markedly improving the NO 3 ‒ yield and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of the eNOR. A heterojunction catalyst consisting of CoMo‐based layered double hydroxide nanosheets grown in situ on Ti 3 C 2 T x MXene (CoMo‐LDH@Ti 3 C 2 T x ) was developed to enable light‐assisted eNOR. The incorporation of Mo into Co‐LDH, together with the built‐in electric field of the heterojunction, enhances Mo–Co orbital hybridization and induces a spin‐state transition of Co 3+ centers from t 2g 6 e g 0 to t 2g 4 e g 2 configuration. This electronic regulation strengthens N 2 activation and accelerates * NOH formation via the cooperative involvement of two •OH radicals under illumination, thereby significantly boosting eNOR kinetics. Consequently, CoMo‐LDH@Ti 3 C 2 T x delivers NO 3 ‒ yield of 198.55 µg h −1 mg cat. −1 and FE of 46.22% under solar light, outperforming dark conditions and state‐of‐the‐art catalysts. These findings underscore the critical roles of spin‐state engineering and radical synergy in advancing sustainable nitrate production.",

While triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) represent a promising solution of wearable energy, many existing fabric‐based TENGs (f‐TENGs) face challenges in terms of weight, environmental adaptability, and scalable manufacturing. Here, we report a unitary, waterproof, and industrially compatible f‐TENG that efficiently harvests energy from diverse natural and biomechanical sources, including rain, wind, and human motion, while functioning as a self‐powered sensor and human–machine interface. The f‐TENG incorporates sueding‐treated polyethylene and nylon fabrics with spray‐coated silicone rubber particles to enhance charge transfer, alongside a porous polyurethane spacer that optimizes compressibility and contact–separation efficiency. This design reduces device weight by over 8 times compared to previous systems while achieving higher electrical output (315 V open‐circuit voltage and 118 mW/m 2 power density). Critically, all fabrication processes align with standard industrial textile manufacturing, ensuring scalability and cost‐effectiveness. We demonstrate applications in health monitoring, speech recognition, interactive controls, and sports training, providing a new direction for fabricating lightweight and cost‐effective multifunctional TENGs, and highlighting the potential of the f‐TENG to enable future generations of self‐powered e‐textiles and sustainable wearable systems.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Integrating both high strength and high toughness into 2D nanocomposites remains a significant challenge owing to the limited interfacial interactions between nanosheets. Here, an interlayer inorganic ionic polymerization (IIIP) strategy is proposed to effectively achieve a combination of high strength and ultrahigh toughness. Specifically, calcium phosphate oligomers (CPO) are anchored onto montmorillonite (MMT) to obtain CPO/MMT composite nanosheets. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and sodium alginate (SA) are incorporated into CPO/MMT interlayers to regulate ionic polymerization of CPO, thereby creating an organic–inorganic dual bridge between MMT nanosheets. The resulting PVA/SA/CPO/MMT (PSCM) film demonstrates a highly integrated structure across the nano‐ to macroscale, facilitated by the dual bridge. Consequently, the PSCM film exhibits a record‐breaking ultrahigh toughness (111.7 ± 9.9 MJ m − 3 ), surpassing all previously reported 2D nanocomposites, along with remarkable tensile strength (292.8 ± 12.7 MPa). The PSCM bulk assembled using films as building units demonstrates an excellent bending energy of 34.43 ± 1.97 MJ m − 3 without fracture, along with remarkable toughness under extreme conditions (e.g., −196°C and 200°C). These high‐performance PSCM demonstrate significant application potential in the field of structural engineering materials. The proposed IIIP strategy paves a new avenue for developing ultrahigh‐toughness 2D nanocomposites.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT All‐solid‐state lithium‐sulfur batteries (ASSLSBs) hold great promise for next‐generation electrochemical energy storage due to sulfur's high theoretical specific capacity and low cost. However, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics and severe volume variations during cycling, as well as poor ionic percolation in composite cathodes, limit their practical viability. To overcome these challenges, we herein introduce solid electrolytes of nominal composition Li 10.5− x Si 1.5 P 1.5 S 12− x I x (with x = 0, 0.2, 0.4), possessing high ionic conductivities of ≥ 7 mS cm −1 at room temperature. We show that increasing iodine content alters the phase composition and triggers reversible redox activity in these materials. If implemented as catholytes, this enables very fast sulfur conversion kinetics, ultimately leading to ASSLSBs with exceptional performance. The cells achieve 86% sulfur utilization at a rate of C/2 and at 45°C and offer high‐rate capability by delivering 1175 mAh g sulfur −1 at 5C and 590 mAh g sulfur −1 at 15C. Furthermore, the synergistic effects of ionic percolation and redox‐activity enable record areal capacities up to 14 mAh cm −2 with a sulfur loading of 10 mg cm −2 . Taken together, our findings provide new strategies for designing redox‐active catholytes for application in advanced ASSLSBs and further strengthen the redox‐mediating role of iodine therein.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Quasi‐2D metal halide perovskites (MHP) have emerged as promising candidates for light‐emitting diodes (PeLEDs) due to their intrinsic advantages in color purity, bandgap tunability, and stability. The prime working principle realizing high radiative emission in quasi‐2D MHP is the ultrafast, consecutive charge transfer (CT) process toward the low‐bandgap crystallites across multiple quantum wells, called charge carrier funneling. Ironically, such a key process is intrinsically limited in the quasi‐2D MHP by the molecular spacers, which have electronically insulating natures. To challenge this limit, herein, we explore the impact of a judiciously designed, stable, and conductive organic radical, (5H‐pyrido[3,2‐b]indole‐2,6‐dichlorophenyl)bis(2,4,6‐trichlorophenyl)methyl as a molecular additive in the MHP matrix. It is found that the spatially delocalized singly occupied molecular orbital offers an electronic bridge accelerating interfacial CT and the carrier funneling by surface adsorption, thus maximizing radiation recombination yield. As a result, the radical‐incorporating PeLEDs (peaking at ≈ 684 nm) achieve a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 26.8% with an operational half‐lifetime of ≈ 340 min, ranking among the best deep‐red devices reported to date. This work demonstrates that rational radical molecular design offers a powerful route to resolve intrinsic CT limitations in quasi‐2D MHP, unlocking both high efficiency and long‐term stability in next‐generation PeLEDs.",

Vertical OECTs (vOECTs), with channel lengths reduced to tens of nanometers, offer high current densities and compact device footprints, but their performance is fundamentally constrained by ion‐impermeable metal top electrodes that restrict ion injection to slow lateral diffusion pathways. Here, we show that electrochemically stable, ion‐permeable conductive polymers such as poly(benzodifurandione) (PBFDO) offer a powerful alternative to metal top electrodes in vOECTs. By enabling direct vertical ion injection into poly(benzimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL) channels, PBFDO yields devices with high current densities (&gt;400 A cm −2 ), large on/off ratios (&gt;10 6 ), and ultrafast switching down to 28 µs, nearly two orders of magnitude faster than equivalent gold‐based vOECTs and among the fastest accumulation‐mode OECTs reported to date. These results establish a new benchmark for OECT speed and underscore the role of ion‐permeable electrodes in overcoming the coupling between electronic and ionic transport in vertical architectures.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The design of high‐sensitivity stretchable piezoelectric sensors remains challenging due to the inherent trade‐off between the ability to achieve high levels of mechanical deformation while maintaining efficient stress transduction. Here, we propose a new topology‐optimization strategy to construct stretchable piezoelectric sensors that efficiently utilize the spatial stress distribution and are able to adapt to a range of anisotropic mechanical stress states. By exploiting computer‐aided topology optimization, the distribution of piezoelectric ceramic units within the sensor was tailored to maximize the degree of stress transfer, resulting in an increase of 103.5% and 59.7% in the maximum piezoelectric potential when subject to tension and torsion, respectively. To ensure structural stretchability and adaptability of the topology optimized sensors when subject to complex loading environments, a direct ink writing process was developed to create stretchable eutectic gallium‐indium liquid alloy (EGaIn) electrodes. Based on a shear‐driven mechanism of printing, new predictive theoretical equations governing printing performance were developed that could predict the printed state (with 94.7% accuracy) and enable trace width control (relative error &lt; 15%). The final optimized sensor exhibited excellent sensitivity, achieving 14.0 V per strain and 0.10 V per degree when subject to tensile and torsional loads, exceeding the unoptimized device by 59.2% and 92.4%, respectively. Finally, inspired by the morphological characteristics of butterflies and guided by the topology‐optimized layout, a multi‐channel sensor was constructed to accurately identify the pattern and amplitude of a complex range of neck movements, demonstrating the significant potential of the new design and manufacturing approach for wearable electronics.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The scalable fabrication of high‐efficiency perovskite solar modules is critically challenged by the difficulty in controlling crystallization homogeneity and mitigating buried interfacial defects across large‐area substrates. The commonly used dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can induce heterogeneous nucleation and is prone to remain trapped within the films. Herein, diethyl sulfoxide (DESO) is introduced, a volatile Lewis acid‐base additive that leverages steric hindrance effects from its branched‐chain structure to achieve mild coordination with PbI 2 . This structural feature reduces the binding energy between DESO and PbI 2 , which avoid the formation of complex metastable intermediate phases. Moreover, the low binding energy of DESO enables its complete removal during vacuum quenching via rapid evaporation, effectively suppressing void formation at the buried interfaces during the subsequent annealing. The resultant perovskite films yield perovskite solar modules (PSMs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 22.9% (11.2 cm 2 , aperture area) and 20.8% (692 cm 2 , aperture area) via scalable processes.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Osteoporosis is characterized by impaired bone formation and disrupted bone marrow homeostasis, largely driven by mitochondrial dysfunction in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). To address this, a live mitochondrial delivery system composed of CXCR4‐engineered macrophages loaded with nanozyme‐functionalized mitochondria (CM‐MTBM). This system integrates bone‐targeted migration, reactive oxygen species scavenging, and communication‐mediated mitochondrial transfer. CM‐MTBM restores mitochondrial respiration, enhances osteogenic differentiation, and alleviates oxidative apoptosis in BMSCs, thereby promoting metabolic recovery and redox balance. In osteoporotic mice, CM‐MTBM treatment markedly improved the trabecular bone microarchitecture and promoted osteogenic repair. Single‐cell transcriptomic analysis further revealed the enrichment of osteogenic BMSC subpopulations and functional reprogramming of the bone marrow immune–metabolic microenvironment. Mechanistically, CM‐MTBM activated mitochondrial oxidative metabolism while suppressing inflammation and senescence‐associated signaling, achieving coordinated metabolic and osteogenic activation. Collectively, this work established a communication‐driven mitochondrial transfer paradigm that reframes mitochondrial therapy from passive structural supplementation to communication‐driven metabolic reprogramming, establishing a conceptual and technological framework for precision treatment of metabolic bone disorders.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT As security threats continue to evolve, static physical unclonable function (PUF) systems are facing inherent limitations in their security sustainability. This growing demand for sustainable security is driving a paradigm shift toward dynamic and reconfigurable PUF systems. However, previous approaches relying on thermal treatments to reconstruct physical entities can be limited in practicality due to concerns over thermal stability and scalability. Here, we present an all‐optical reconfigurable PUF that fills this unmet need through non‐invasive and scalable optical techniques. To demonstrate this, we introduce a nanopatterning method that employs plasmonic coupling‐induced sintering of optically trapped gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to fabricate optical PUFs. The resulting PUFs, which leverage complex spatiospectral information, deliver practically sufficient security, outstanding encoding density, and robust resistance against machine learning‐based modeling attacks. Furthermore, we validate the applicability of the proposed PUF system for anti‐counterfeiting and traceability applications by implementing a lightweight authentication protocol that exhibits reliable performance. Lastly, we demonstrate that irreversible and on‐demand reconfiguration through optothermal nudging of patterned AuNPs enables repeated generation of unpredictable and independent responses while maintaining consistent security. These demonstrations signify the potential of our all‐optical approach as a promising pathway toward achieving sustainable hardware‐based security.",

However, the strong vibroacoustic coupling and high hydrostatic pressure hamper the experimental enhancement of acoustic information capacity in underwater communication via passively modulating coaxial beams. Here, we report the experimental realization of simultaneous information capacity enhancement and hybrid physical‐computational camouflage in underwater free‐space pressure‐independent acoustic‐vortex communication. Two inverse‐designed free‐flooded metasurfaces, with hydrostatically resilient stability and customized wave scattering characteristics, synthesize and demodulate experimentally coaxial vortex beams of different topological charges, enabling physically encrypted, port‐to‐port information transfer. A computational‐mask encryption scheme further digitally conceals a plaintext image within two ciphertext bitstreams. Transmission of these ciphertexts through the synthesized hetero‐order vortex beams experimentally confirms physical‐computational anti‐eavesdropping capabilities of the system.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Conventional cathodes of lithium battery relying on single storage mechanisms—whether intercalation or conversion—face intrinsic limitations in energy density and sluggish electrode kinetics. Hybrid systems combining both mechanisms offer promising pathways to transcend these constraints; yet, their dynamic interfacial synergies remain poorly deciphered at the nanoscale. This study employs multimodal in situ characterization (Electrochemical atomic force microscopy/Raman/Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy) to elucidate the dynamic synergy in TiS 2 ‐S hybrid cathodes, revealing the concurrent interfacial evolution during cycling: nanoscale steps formation via Li‐ion intercalation in the TiS 2 ‐LiTiS 2 host and the phase transformation of S‐Li 2 S/Li 2 S 2 . Crucially, the TiS 2 /LiTiS 2 serves as a bifunctional interface that not only contributes capacity but also mediates sulfide adsorption and catalyzes preferential edge‐directed sulfide deposition. The partially delithiated Li x TiS 2 enhances electronic conductivity, creating rapid electron transport that facilitates subsequent interfacial sulfide conversion reaction. The hybrid storage mechanism retains features characteristic of both S and TiS 2 storage mechanisms, yet manifests synergistic interfacial reconstruction rather than simple superposition, achieving enhanced reversibility, exceptional cycling stability, and superior rate capability.",

This review systematically explores the thermodynamic and electrochemical landscape of AMSeBs, integrating theoretical analysis with experimental advances to establish a rational design framework. First, by evaluating key parameters, including electrode potentials, volume change rates, solubility of metal selenides, and energy metrics, we identify promising systems such as Zn‐Se and Cu‐Se, along with unexplored candidates like Fe‐Se and Ga‐Se. Second, selenium‐based cathodes are categorized into three types, elemental Se &amp; Se x S y composites, organic selenides, and transition metal selenides, with emphasis on multi‐electron transfer mechanisms, particularly the six‐electron Se 4+ /Se 2− redox pathway, which offers a route to overcome capacity limitations. Third, strategies for stabilizing metal anodes, expanding the electrochemical stability window of aqueous electrolytes, and mitigating shuttle effects are critically discussed. Finally, we outline future directions, including interface engineering, artificial intelligence‐assisted material screening, and flexible device integration, providing a roadmap toward high‐performance AMSeBs for next‐generation energy storage applications.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Harnessing solar energy to produce value‐added chemicals simultaneously requires the critical step of spatially separating redox processes. However, conventional photocatalysts remain fundamentally constrained by sluggish charge dynamics and irreversible recombination. Here, we propose an atomic‐level interfacial shuttle mechanism in sub‐nanometer gold cluster‐anchored nickel manganite (H‐NiMn 2 O 4‐β /Au 0.5 NCs), which couples dynamic electron–hole separation with Ni 3+ /Ni 2+ redox cycling. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy indicates electron transfer occurring within 3.06 ps, mediated by an Au–O–Ni coordination interface. In this system, Ni 3+ functions as a transient electron trap, undergoing rapid reduction to Ni 2+ and subsequently transferring electrons to adjacent Au clusters, accelerating charge kinetics by 22.16‐fold. This atomic‐scale electron relay selectively steers 2e − oxygen reduction by balancing *OOH intermediate stabilization and desorption, yielding H 2 O 2 at 1.00 mmol g −1 h −1 . Simultaneously, hole accumulation on lattice oxygen drives α–H abstraction, enabling photooxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde (14.59 mmol g −1 h −1 ). This work presents a dynamic dual‐site catalysis model, offering atomic‐level insight into interfacial charge management for solar‐driven redox transformations.",

However, developing luminescent materials that integrate multicolor emission, high color purity, and mechanical flexibility at high temperatures remains an appealing yet formidable challenge. Herein, inspired by the multilevel architecture protecting pigments in the vividly colored butterfly's wing, we present a multiscale self‐confinement strategy to fabricate flexible perovskite luminescent nanofibrous meta‐aerogels with bioinspired thermal armor. Benefiting from multidimensional encapsulation to shield perovskite from extrinsic environmental perturbations and directional confinement to suppress ion migration and particle agglomeration, the biomimetic flexible meta‐aerogels achieve stable luminescence up to 600 K. The resulting meta‐aerogels exhibit tunable emission from blue to red and narrow‐band emission (full width at half maximum &lt; 45 nm). Furthermore, the meta‐aerogels demonstrate excellent recovery after 500 compression cycles and temperature‐invariant superelasticity. These advancements highlight the significant potential of these materials for next‐generation flexible lighting and display applications under extreme conditions.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Biological tissues and engineered composites achieve exceptional mechanical properties through microstructures that create stiffness and toughness in preferred directions. While composites traditionally leverage solid reinforcements to drive this anisotropy, directional mechanics in all‐soft matter composites remain a longstanding challenge, despite their importance for soft devices that stretch and adapt under load. Here, we create all‐soft matter composites where liquid inclusions direct and enable anisotropic and heterogeneous mechanical properties. By shaping and orienting liquid metal droplets within elastomers, we program directional stiffness, enhance toughness beyond 36,000 J m −2 , and guide cracks along non‐linear paths with deflections up to 150 during extreme deformations. This allows liquids, which are up to a million times softer than traditional rigid inclusions, to act as mechanical reinforcements. These liquid inclusions enhance directional stiffness or softness relative to unfilled elastomers and enable programmable crack‐path engineering that surpasses simple blunting or trapping, with anisotropy tuned on demand during processing. We leverage this to protect soft circuits even under catastrophic damage, offering new possibilities to direct mechanical forces in compliant materials for resilient soft electronics and robots, wearables, and morphing matter.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Interpretations of evolutionary outcomes are limited without incorporation of physiological ecology, and ecophysiological interpretations would benefit from incorporating evolutionary perspectives. Although there has been a rise of studies in the last 20 years between these fields, evolutionary studies that incorporate plant physiology have largely focused on the same traits (e.g., flowering time, specific leaf area), neglecting cellular and developmental traits. This neglect is largely due to the high throughput demands in evolutionary studies and the lack of technological advancements in ecophysiology. However, this bias in measured traits has resulted in limiting our understanding of the evolution of plant form and function. On the other hand, most detailed studies on plant physiological and anatomical responses to the environment are either in applied sciences, focused on economically important plants, or examine model organisms rather than wild populations. These detailed ecophysiological studies generally do not incorporate evolutionary discourse, even though they often study adaptation. The aim of this synthesis is to offer a comprehensive resource, building upon previous works, for researchers to bridge the gap between ecophysiology and evolutionary ecology.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Premise Populations can locally adapt to the biotic and abiotic factors of environments. However, detecting adaptation to biotic factors can depend on the abiotic conditions in which the adaptation is tested, and vice versa. The microbiome is one important aspect of the biotic environment: Interactions between microbiomes and their hosts are critical for host fitness and trait expression. If hosts adapt to local microbiomes, they may therefore depend on interactions with local microbes to express trait values adapted to the local abiotic environment. Methods Using Lemna minor (duckweed) as a model host, we examined differences in host fitness when grown in local and nonlocal microbiomes and in local and nonlocal water. We experimentally recombined duckweeds, microbes, and water from four ponds around Durham, New Hampshire (United States) in well‐plate microcosms in a growth chamber. Results The source of duckweeds, microbes, and water all affected microbial growth, duckweed growth, and duckweed traits. However, weak, marginally significant local adaptation resulted in higher frond area only when duckweeds were paired with their local water and local microbes. Microbial growth was also marginally reduced when duckweeds were paired with microbes and water from their local site. Conclusions While microbiome impacts on duckweed growth and traits varied across abiotic contexts, local microbiomes provided only limited growth benefits. Harnessing the effects of plant microbiomes is an exciting area of applied research. Despite our findings, bioprospecting in local microbiomes could still be fruitful: It may be ecologically safer, and other plants may locally adapt to microbiomes.",

    "Abstract": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of NHL in the Western Hemisphere. It comprises a heterogenous group of lymphomas, with different biology and clinical prognoses. R-CHP remains the backbone of therapy, and frontline therapeutic options in fit patients are pola-R-CHP and R-CHOP, whereas elderly or frail/unfit patients may be treated with R-mini-CHOP or palliation. Frontline trials aim to improve outcomes for patients with high-risk disease utilizing R-CHOP + novel agents, CAR-T, and bispecific antibodies. Trials in the elderly/unfit population are minimizing and omitting chemotherapy. Risk-adapted approaches targeting cell of origin (COO) and utilizing interim PET imaging or ctDNA to guide therapy escalation or deescalation remain under investigation. Second line therapy curative-intent approaches include CAR-T or autologous stem cell transplantation, depending upon timing of disease progression after first-line therapy. In the relapsed/refractory setting, there has been a rapid growth in the therapeutic armamentarium, including bispecific antibody combinations with chemotherapy, bispecific antibodies with antibody-drug conjugates, and brentuximab vedotin + lenalidomide + rituximab.

Mesothelioma, primarily attributable to asbestos exposure, has been listed specifically as one of the notifiable diseases under the Mines Act, 1952, and is notifiable under the category of occupational cancer in the Factories Act, 1948. The total number of cases of mesothelioma notified to the Directorate General of Mines Safety under the mining safety law was zero from 2004 to 2024. Similarly, under the factory safety law, only one case of occupational cancer was notified in one state, in a country of 28 states and 8 union territories (mesothelioma being listed under occupational cancer and not a separate entry under the factories law). This is in sharp contrast to the medical literature, where a large number of cases have been published by researchers and doctors from Indian hospitals. The absence of notified disease may not automatically mean the absence of disease. Further, a parallel National Cancer Registry Program, which is not only for occupational cancers, but which may overlap with occupational cases, covers only 16% of the country's population. With clear lack of notification of cases and underreporting of occupational mesothelioma, and cancer not being declared as universally notifiable at the national level, disease surveillance in India may need to be invigorated so that easily preventable disease is reduced, load on the already strained healthcare infrastructure is decreased, and overall national medical costs are reduced in the future.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Elastic ferroelectrics, distinguished by their softness, stretchability, and ferroelectric and piezoelectric responses, are promising candidates in next‐generation wearable electronics. Currently, the intrinsic elastification of ferroelectric polymers has been achieved through a “slight crosslinking” strategy, which relies on costly poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)‐based copolymers with low Curie temperatures, thereby limiting their operation at high temperatures. In contrast, PVDF homopolymers are low‐cost and possess an inherently high Curie temperature, while their high modulus has long hindered elasticity. Here, we overcome these limitations by introducing highly reactive, soft long‐chain crosslinkers into PVDF homopolymers, enabling simultaneous low cost, high thermal stability, and intrinsic elasticity. By tuning the crosslinking density, intrinsically elastic ferroelectrics based on PVDF homopolymer were obtained with over 80% elastic recovery under 60% strain. Remarkably, the materials retain a high remanent polarization ( P r ) of 7.00 µC/cm 2 at 110°C. The materials maintain stable ferroelectric responses even under strains up to 70%. This study resolves the long‐standing challenge of elastifying high‐modulus PVDF homopolymers and develops a low‐cost, thermally robust, intrinsically elastic ferroelectric. These advances outline a promising pathway toward next‐generation wearable electronics that demand both high elasticity and high‐temperature operation.",

Key parameters including peak force, contact stiffness, bending stiffness, and absorbed energy were analyzed to evaluate impact resistance under progressive damage. SEM fractography was conducted to investigate failure mechanisms and GPL dispersion. Results show that GPL incorporation significantly modifies the impact response of BFRCs. All laminates exhibited increased peak force and contact stiffness between the 10th and 20th impacts, indicating a temporary strengthening effect. At this stage, the 0.2 wt.% GPL composite achieved a 44% increase in peak force compared to pure BFRC, while the 0.4 wt.% GPL composite showed limited improvement. Beyond 20 impacts, stiffness degradation occurred due to damage accumulation; however, GPL‐modified composites exhibited delayed degradation. At higher impact numbers, the 0.4 wt.% GPL composite demonstrated superior bending stiffness retention and energy absorption. SEM analysis confirmed crack deflection, platelet pull‐out, and enhanced interfacial bonding, contributing to improved damage tolerance.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Water scarcity is an escalating global issue due to population growth, climate change, and increasing demand for clean water. Membrane technologies, particularly ultrafiltration (UF) membranes, have gained significant attention for water purification owing to their high efficiency, cost‐effectiveness, and energy‐saving properties. However, membrane fouling and reaching high water flux and high removal efficiencies remain a critical challenge, affecting operational performance and longevity. In this study, we investigated the influence of biotite and biotene, natural clay‐based nanomaterials, on the performance of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) UF membranes. Various concentrations of biotite (1 wt%) and biotene (0.1–2 wt%) were incorporated into PVC membranes via phase inversion technique. The fabricated membranes were characterized using SEM, FTIR, and zeta potential analysis. Performance evaluations, including permeability, antifouling properties, and organic pollutant removal efficiency, were conducted using bovine serum albumin, Reactive Red 120, and Reactive Black 5. Results demonstrated that the incorporation of 1 wt% biotene significantly enhanced membrane permeability, hydrophilicity, and antifouling properties while maintaining high pollutant rejection rates. Long‐term stability tests further confirmed the potential of biotene‐modified PVC membranes for water and wastewater treatment applications. This study presents a novel approach to improving PVC UF membrane performance using naturally abundant and cost‐effective nanomaterials.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT A poly(p‐phenylene terephthalamide) (PPTA)‐based solvent‐resistant composite nanofiltration membrane (PPMU membrane), namely PPTA/Polypyrrole@UiO‐66‐NH 2 /Polyelectrolyte Multilayers (PPTA/PPy@UiO‐66‐NH 2 /PEMs), was successfully fabricated via a two‐step strategy. First, polypyrrole (PPy) nano separation layers were in situ polymerized on PPTA surfaces using chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Subsequently, polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) membranes were constructed via layer‐by‐layer self‐assembly (LBL) on PPTA/PPy surfaces, with UiO‐66‐NH 2 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) introduced to optimize membrane performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the PPMU(M5) composite nanofiltration membrane maintains high permeation flux while significantly enhancing rejection of small‐molecule dyes and inorganic salt ions. The rejection rates for CR, MB, and MO dye solutions are 99.70%, 94.59%, and 93.25%, respectively, while those for Na 2 SO 4 , MgSO 4 , and CaCl 2 reach 99.12%, 95.29%, and 85.09%, respectively. Additionally, the membrane exhibits excellent solvent resistance, retaining stable separation performance after immersion in organic solvents for one month. To address the low flux of PPTA/PPy nanofiltration membranes, the high porosity of UiO‐66‐NH 2 was leveraged to optimize mass transfer channels, while the LBL method was used to regulate surface charge and microstructure. This approach overcomes the traditional trade‐off between flux and rejection in nanofiltration membranes, achieving both high flux and high rejection. The strategy provides a new design paradigm for solvent‐resistant nanofiltration (SRNF) membranes in treating complex organic wastewater.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Membranes with slippery liquid‐infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) have emerged as highly promising candidates for oil/water separation owing to high separation efficiency and anti‐fouling properties. However, the fabrication of SLIPS is complex and often involves organic solvents, posing environmental and cost concerns. This study developed an oleogel‐based slippery membrane via a green solvent‐free method. A beeswax/paraffin oil oleogel was hot‐pressed onto the surface of polypropylene (PP) membrane. The obtained PP‐OleG membrane exhibited self‐lubricating property, enabling water droplets to slide on the surface. Further infusion of paraffin oil yielded a PP‐OleG‐oil membrane with enhanced slippery property and anti‐protein adhesion. The oleogel and oil layers on the membrane surface demonstrated good stability. Both PP‐OleG and PP‐OleG‐oil membranes outperformed unmodified PP in water‐in‐oil emulsion separation. Notably, the PP‐OleG‐oil membrane protected by oleogel and oil layers prevented direct contact between contaminants and the membrane substrate, resulting in excellent anti‐fouling performance. After six cycles of filtration, the flux recovery rate reached 86%, and the separation efficiency remained above 98.5%. This oleogel‐based membrane offers a feasible approach to enhancing anti‐fouling performance in oil/water separation and also provides insights for wastewater treatment through green strategies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The development of processable materials that integrate flame retardancy, mechanical robustness, and microwave absorption for use in next‐generation high‐density electronic devices remains a critical challenge. This study reports on multifunctional graphene/carbon nanotube/polybutylene terephthalate composites fabricated via melt blending. The influence of graphene content on the flame retardancy, microwave absorption, and mechanical performance of the resulting composites was investigated. Flammability testing demonstrates that the incorporation of 2 phr of graphene significantly improves fire resistance, upgrading the UL‐94 rating from V‐2 (3.2 mm) to V‐0 (1.6 mm) and increasing the glow wire ignition temperature by 25°C. Cone calorimetry and scanning electron microscopy–energy‐dispersive X‐ray spectroscopy results indicate that graphene promotes char formation and suppresses volatile flammable gas release. Regarding microwave absorption, graphene facilitates the formation of a robust conductive network, yielding a minimum reflection loss of −15.31 dB at 12 GHz with a thickness of 2.8 mm. Mechanical characterization reveals that the incorporation of 2 phr of graphene enhances the tensile, flexural, and impact strengths by 13.2%, 9.5%, and 50%, respectively. Because of these integrated properties, the composite is a promising candidate for industrial systems requiring both safety and multifunctionality.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Polyethylene (PE) films are widely used in packaging but require surface modification to improve interfacial adhesion with coatings or laminates that enhance their inherently limited barrier properties. In this study, low‐density (LDPE) and high‐density polyethylene (HDPE) films are treated with argon (Ar) cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) using a jet‐type device, and their properties are characterized prior to and post processing. While plasma exposure enhances wettability by halving the water contact angle (WCA) and increasing surface free energy (SFE), it compromises the film surface structure, increasing water vapor and oxygen permeability by up to 60% and 45%, respectively. Aging tests reveal partial recovery of hydrophobicity, though WCAs stabilize below the untreated values. FTIR spectra indicate the formation of polar groups (hydroxyl and carbonyl) after 10–30 min of treatment, accompanied by increased crystallinity. SEM shows pronounced surface etching and morphological alterations, consistent with roughness analysis, which displays a sharp rise after 10 min followed by a slight decrease at 30 min. Antimicrobial capacity remains limited, while long‐term degradation results in minimal weight loss (WL), despite sustaining low WCAs. Overall, although CAP treatment impairs the film intrinsic structure, it significantly improves surface chemistry and topography for interfacial bonding, thus optimizing multilayer packaging applications.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The high flammability of ethylene‐vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers limits their important applications in fire safety, thus it has become imperative to improve the fire retardancy through the incorporation of flame retardants. In this study, a novel two‐dimensional (2D) metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) material of ZIF‐L has been successfully synthesized and characterized. An intumescent flame retardant (IFR) composed of ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and tannic acid (TA) in conjunction with ZIF‐L was constructed and molten‐compounded into the EVA matrix. The flame retardancy of EVA composites was evaluated using limiting oxygen index (LOI) tests, vertical burning testing (UL‐94), and cone calorimetry tests. Compared with neat EVA, the EVA/29(APP/TA)/1ZIF‐L composite exhibited an increased LOI from 20.1% to 24.6%, an improved UL‐94 rating from none to V‐0, and a 60.5% reduction in peak heat release rate (pHRR). Analysis of the decomposition products and char residue suggests a synergistic flame‐retardant effect in condensed phase and gas phase. Moreover, owing to the UV absorption of TA and ZIF‐L and the free‐radical scavenging ability of TA, the EVA composites exhibited significantly enhanced UV shielding, reaching an “excellent” level.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Although ceratopsid dinosaurs possess a characteristically hypertrophied narial region, soft‐tissue anatomy associated with such a skeletal structure and their biological significance remain poorly understood. The present study provides the first comprehensive hypothesis on the soft‐tissue anatomy in the ceratopsid rostrum based on the Extant Phylogenetic Bracket approach. Several cranial specimens of Triceratops including the computed tomography‐scan data of an isolated premaxilla as well as those of phylogenetically diverse ceratopsids were examined and compared to the anatomical features of the rostrum in extant reptiles. The resulting hypothesis includes the narial neurovascular pathways and locations of the nasal gland and nasolacrimal duct. Particularly, the narial innervation pattern in ceratopsids is inferred to be unique among reptiles and is suggested to have evolved in response to the enlargement of the naris. In addition, respiratory turbinates are inferred to have been present in ceratopsids for the first time based on an osteological correlate and would likely have served for cephalic thermal regulation as in extant birds and mammals. Acquisition of such a structure might have mitigated a thermal problem associated with the large size of the ceratopsid head.",

However, little is known about whether such differences are quantitative or qualitative, especially in the morphosyntactic domain. This study is the first longitudinal research aiming to systematically investigate the developmental patterns of a wide range of Mandarin grammatical markers in autistic children. The mastery of target markers in autistic children ( N = 88, M age = 44.9 m, Range = 26–76 m) was assessed longitudinally across three time points using parent reports and compared with that of TD children ( N = 84, M age = 23.2 m, Range = 16–30 m) assessed at a single time point. We further examined the influence of autism severity and initial language ability. The results suggested that autistic children acquired Mandarin grammatical markers in a typical sequence but at a slower rate. Additionally, this developmental pattern was maintained regardless of autism severity and initial language ability. These findings suggest that autistic children's language development differs quantitatively but not qualitatively from that of TD children, reflecting developmental delay rather than deviance.",

Among available methodologies, redox based signaling offers unique advantages due to its ubiquity in biology and compatibility with standard electrochemical equipment, expanding on existing electrogenetic approaches while simplifying entry requirements for researchers. Here, we developed a modular phenazine‐based system that enables bidirectional redox communication between electronic devices and engineered bacterial populations using commercially available electrodes. Our system integrates readily into existing synthetic biology frameworks and leverages phenazine modifications to modulate signal reception across biological and electronic domains. We structured our design around four modular components within a communication channel framework: (1) electronic signal encoding via electrochemically generated hydrogen peroxide that activates engineered cells to produce quorum sensing molecules, (2) biological signal transmission through phenazine biosynthesis controlled by a single regulatory target (PhzF), (3) dual‐domain signal reception via both SoxRS‐responsive biological circuits and direct electrochemical detection, and (4) controllable noise through phenazine‐specific degradation enzymes. We demonstrate proportional control over phenazine production with linear relationships between electronic inputs and both biological and electrochemical outputs. This modular approach establishes phenazines as versatile bridges between electronic and biological information processing, providing accessible tools for practical bioelectronic systems with applications in environmental monitoring, adaptive biomanufacturing, and responsive biomedical devices.",

Four water‐soluble, cationic BODIPY derivatives bearing para‐substituents (–H, –OMe, –NO 2 , and –I) were prepared via an azide–alkyne click reaction, enabling a controlled structure–property comparison using a fixed mitochondrial‐targeting scaffold. All compounds exhibited characteristic BODIPY absorption and emission profiles, with BHTP, BMTP, and BITP maintaining high fluorescence quantum yields, whereas BNTP showed pronounced fluorescence quenching due to photo‐induced electron transfer. Singlet oxygen quantum yields (ΦΔ = 0.01–0.06) were strongly dependent on meso‐phenyl electronic effects, with BITP displaying the highest ΦΔ as a result of the heavy‐atom effect. Cellular studies revealed negligible dark cytotoxicity for all derivatives and pronounced light‐induced cytotoxicity for BITP and BMTP. Confocal co‐localization experiments confirmed preferential mitochondrial accumulation, as evidenced by strong overlap with MitoTracker Red signals. Collectively, these results demonstrate that meso‐phenyl electronic tuning, combined with a fixed cationic and water‐soluble BODIPY scaffold, provides an effective strategy for balancing fluorescence imaging and PDT activity, offering design guidelines for mitochondria‐targeted theranostic photosensitizers.",

The Industrial Internet, a pivotal technology in the global industrial transformation, can enable green transitions and significantly improve corporate green innovation. However, its effectiveness significantly varies, and the general mechanisms determining its success remain unexplored. From an organizational capability perspective, this study examines this globally relevant issue using data from Chinese listed manufacturing companies from 2008 to 2023. A further analysis reveals that the empowering effect critically depends on organizational capability and exhibits a double‐threshold effect. As the organizational capability strengthens, the Industrial Internet's positive impact becomes more significant. Theoretically, this study defines organizational capability as a mechanism and critical boundary condition, advancing the understanding of how digital technologies enable green innovation. It also provides corporate managers with a strategic framework to assess the risks and returns of digital transformation, guiding them to prioritize capability building. It also offers scientific evidence for governments to design precise industrial policies to optimize public resource allocations and accelerate green transitions in global manufacturing.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The exploitation of molecular self‐assembly, which leads to the formation of aggregates, represents one of the most crucial approaches in the fabrication of advanced functional materials. A fundamental aspect in this area is the development of novel strategies to construct supramolecular architectures with new (unusual) properties, in particular, strongly fluorescent H‐aggregates. Using 2‐(2‐carboalkoxy‐3,4,5‐trichloro‐6‐hydroxyphenyl)benzoxazoles (HBOs) as building blocks, H‐aggregates were successfully obtained in both aqueous binary mixtures and the crystalline state. These aggregates exhibit intense fluorescence despite the prohibition imposed by Kasha's rule. This violation seems to result from the deactivation mechanism of the excited excitonic state in HBO H‐aggregates, which involves, along with internal conversion, a photochemical channel induced by excited‐state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) rather than a radiative one. The consequence of ESIPT is monomeric fluorescence from the keto forms of HBOs. The fluorescence quantum yields of HBOs in the crystalline state are significantly higher than those in solution, ranging from 0.81 to 0.91. This enhancement is due to intramolecular hydrogen bonds as well as the dense molecular packing of HBOs, which suppresses conformational transformations.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Metal nanoclusters (MNCs)‐semiconductor (SC) composite materials have garnered significant attention due to the fascinating and versatile properties exhibited by MNCs. However, there is a scarcity of efforts directed toward incorporating metal nanoparticles (MNPs) into MNCs‐SC composites to facilitate charge generation within the system. And the underlying mechanism governing charge transfer in such systems remains elusive. In this work, a straightforward reduction‐adsorption strategy was employed to ingeniously introduce AuNCs into the AgNPs@MoS 2 binary nanostructure. This approach effectively improves the electron‐donating performance of resulting AuNCs‐AgNPs@MoS 2 ternary heterostructures, which were utilized as the substrates for SERS‐active p ‐nitrothiophenol (PNTP)‐catalytic reactions. PNTP‐catalytic experiments further validated the enhanced catalytic performance arising from the introduction of AuNCs into the ternary heterostructure. Furthermore, the composite mechanism of AuNCs and AgNPs in the nanosystem was elucidated, revealing that AgNPs act as charge bridges and synergistically facilitate charge generation in conjunction with AuNCs. The electron‐donating capability was quantified using the concept of charge transfer degree, rendering the impact of AuNCs incorporation on charge yield more intuitive. This study is anticipated to provide a rational approach for the construction of MNCs‐MNPs@SC ternary nanostructures and optimizing the synergistic interaction between MNCs and MNPs, thereby enabling their applications across diverse fields.",

Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), an inflammation‐associated reactive oxygen species has emerged as a key pathogenic mediator and early biomarker of fibrotic progression. Herein, guided by a structure–activity relationship (SAR) strategy, three donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) fluorescent probes ( PMBT , CMBT , and TMBT ) were rationally designed and systematically evaluated for HOCl detection. Density functional theory calculations (DFT) and spectroscopic studies reveal donor‐dependent electronic distributions and distinct HOCl‐responsive behaviors. Among them, PMBT exhibits a rapid turn‐on response (&lt;10 s), naked‐eye‐detectable fluorescence enhancement, and a low detection limit of 11.38 nM, along with favorable mitochondrial localization. Benefiting from its high sensitivity and liver‐targeting capability, PMBT enables effective imaging of endogenous HOCl and allows precise visualization of early‐stage liver fibrosis in mouse models, highlighting its potential as a powerful diagnostic tool.",

    "Abstract": "We describe a method for determining the ultrastructural organization of axons and varicosities of cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Cryo-EM reveals the dimensions, proximity, and overall organization of biological specimens in a near-native state, avoiding artifacts of fixation and heavy metal staining employed in classic thin section ultramicroscopy. Cryo-EM excels with thin specimens, and the axons of cryo-preserved cultured DRG neurons are the ideal thickness for high-resolution cryo-electron tomography. DRG neurons are a particularly interesting neuronal preparation because they can be isolated from animals of any age, providing a unique resource to examine age-related changes in axonal morphology. We provide a detailed, step-by-step protocol from DRG isolation and culturing, through cryo-preservation and data acquisition and analysis. We also provide a description for data processing in batch and how implementing deep-learning strategies can facilitate taking tilt-series data through the process of semi-automated tomographic segmentation required for quantitative descriptions of ultrastructural features. We use segmentations focused on the cytoskeletal elements of axons and varicosities of young and old cultured DRG neurons to highlight the approach.",

Although technetium lymphoscintigraphy is the most common adjunct, indocyanine green (ICG) demonstrates a promising alternative in pediatric, adolescent, and young adult (AYA) skin and soft tissue cancers. Methods and Objectives Evaluate the safety and efficacy of ICG in SLN biopsy (SLNB) in diverse pediatric and AYA solid cancers in a multi‐institutional environment. This is a prospective, observational study conducted at 13 member institutions in the Pediatric Surgical Oncology Research Collaborative between 2019 and 2023. Eligible patients underwent SLNB for primary or recurrent solid skin and soft tissue tumors. Peritumoral ICG was administered intraoperatively. Outcomes included SLN detection rates, histopathology of excised specimens, and surgeon‐reported assessment of utility. Safety was assessed through adverse event reporting. Results Forty SLNB procedures yielded 84 specimens: 13 melanoma (32.5%), 12 squamous cell carcinoma (30%), 11 non‐rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma (27.5%), two rhabdomyosarcoma (5%), one Ewing sarcoma (2.5%), and one malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (2.5%). Histologic evaluation identified 81 lymph nodes, 75 benign (89.3%) and six malignant (7.1%); three specimens were adipose tissue (3.6%). Of 81 lymph nodes, 76% were ICG‐positive. ICG had a sensitivity of 79.5%, a specificity of 33%, and a positive predictive value of 96%. All malignant nodes were ICG‐avid. There were no adverse reactions to ICG at 30 days.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Circulating cell‐free human papillomavirus (ccfHPV) DNA is a promising biomarker for cervical cancer monitoring. This study used next‐generation sequencing (NGS) to assess its prognostic and surveillance value. Methods The authors included 141 cervical cancer patients (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics IA1–IVB) grouped by treatment: primary surgery ( n = 50), primary surgery + adjuvant oncological ( n = 22), and primary oncological treatment ( n = 69). Plasma was collected pretreatment, at early follow‐up (first post‐treatment sample [FPS]), and during longer follow‐up. ccfHPV DNA was detected using an NGS‐based assay, enabling high sensitivity without prior knowledge of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype. Associations between ccfHPV DNA status and recurrence were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models, and predictive accuracy was evaluated via sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Results Pretreatment ccfHPV DNA positivity was detected in 8.0%, 36.4%, and 82.6% of patients across the groups, and ccfHPV DNA positivity was significantly associated with higher recurrence risk (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 4.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.29–18.7; p = .02). At FPS, ccfHPV DNA positivity strongly predicted recurrence (adjusted HR, 19.1; 95% CI, 7.27–50.2), with a PPV of 83% and NPV of 90% for recurrence within 50 months. Among patients who developed recurrence, ccfHPV DNA was detectable before clinical evidence of recurrence in 60.9% of cases with a mean lead time of 144 days. Conclusion ccfHPV DNA detected by NGS is a strong prognostic biomarker for residual disease or recurrence. Its strong performance, already at early follow‐up, supports its integration into individualized follow‐up strategies. Prospective multicenter studies should validate these findings and guide clinical implementation. Trial Registration The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifiers: NCT03749720)",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Color is a crucial factor in the textile industry, directly affecting product quality and customer satisfaction. Traditionally, fabric color measurement has primarily relied on spectroscopic methods and colorimeters, which require direct contact with the fabric samples and often involve high costs. With the innovations of image processing technology, image‐based color measurement (IBCM) methods have provided new possibilities thanks to their flexibility and automation potential. This paper provides an overview of IBCM approaches, including multispectral imaging systems, hyperspectral imaging, digital cameras, and scanners. Recent studies have shown that the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision in color measurement can enhance measurement accuracy and stability. However, this method still faces many challenges, such as the influence of ambient lighting, camera angles, fabric materials, and discrepancies among measuring devices. In addition, the work discusses color correction techniques aimed at improving the IBCM's accuracy, including spectral reflectance reconstruction, color balancing, and machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the paper analyzes the applicability of IBCM technology in industrial textile quality control, and proposes future research directions, such as developing advanced AI algorithms, integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and establishing standards for IBCM. The findings suggest that, despite remaining challenges, IBCM is emerging as a promising solution to replace or complement traditional color measurement methods in the textile industry.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Photocatalytic CO 2 conversion driven by solar energy offers a sustainable pathway for carbon neutrality, but remains limited by inefficient charge dynamics and poor spectral utilization. However, copper chalcogenides exhibit dual UV–vis absorption and near‐infrared (NIR) plasmonic resonance suffer from rapid electron–hole recombination and insufficient catalytic activity. This study introduces nested metallic‐semiconductor Cu‐based heterostructures (Cu/CuSe) synthesized through dissolution–reduction to address these limitations. The engineered architecture incorporates metallic Cu clusters and selenium vacancies within CuSe nanosheets, which collectively broaden NIR absorption through defect‐induced gap states for enhanced photothermal activation. This approach promotes directional electron transfer to Cu clusters, which suppress electron–hole recombination and serve as catalytically active sites. Additionally, seamless coupling between the components lowers interfacial energy losses. Density functional theory calculations reveal that Cu clusters effectively reduce CO 2 activation barriers by stabilizing critical reaction intermediates. The heterostructures achieve a threefold increase in CO yield (27.06 μmol g −1 h −1 ) under full‐spectrum irradiation compared to pristine CuSe, with a 90% selectivity without sacrificial agents. The photothermal–photocatalytic synergy harnesses a cascade energy conversion pathway, outperforming conventional plasmonic semiconductor systems. This work establishes a defect‐engineering strategy to enhance infrared energy harvesting and charge management in broadband‐responsive photocatalysts.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction to ammonia (eNRA) offers a sustainable and green pathway for ammonia (NH 3 ) synthesis. Although due to the inferior hydrogenation ability, Cu‐based nonprecious electrocatalysts often suffer a low NH 3 Faradaic efficiency and high overpotential are often needed to deep reduction of *NO 2 , resulting in a high energy consumption. Herein, a galvanic replacement strategy is proposed to synthesize a CuCoRu Aerogel (CuCoRu AG) electrocatalyst with low‐content Ru (10.7 at%) to realize efficient eNRA at a significantly reduced overpotential. The optimized Cu 5 Co 5 Ru AG displays a remarkable NH 3 yield rate of 2.7 ± 0.1 mmol cm −2 h −1 with an ultrahigh Faradaic efficiency of 97.0 ± 3.81% at −0.1 V versus RHE, surpassing most reported Cu‐based electrocatalysts. Systematic characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that the rational incorporation of low amounts of Ru can further regulate the electronic state to significantly reduce the hydrogenation barrier. Furthermore, the robust Aerogel network architecture provides a good self‐supportability to avoid excess agglomeration and ripening, endowing a long‐term operational durability over 100 h of continuous electrolysis. This work underscores the pivotal role of electronic structure regulation and three‐dimensional porous architectures in the design of next‐generation, low‐cost, and high‐efficiency eNRA electrocatalysts.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Dietary interventions represent a promising approach for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study investigated the antihyperglycemic and antioxidant effects of composite bread formulated from Bambara groundnut (BG) and wheat flour blends (0%–75% BG), fortified with orange peel powder, in a high‐fat diet/streptozotocin (HFD/STZ)‐induced diabetic rat model. Over a 14‐day feeding period, rats fed BG‐based composite bread showed significant improvements in blood glucose regulation, enzyme inhibition, and oxidative stress markers compared with untreated diabetic controls. Diabetic rats initially showed elevated blood glucose levels, increased activities of α‐glucosidase, α‐amylase, and lipase, alongside reduced antioxidant enzyme activities and increased lipid peroxidation. However, rats fed BG bread, particularly those on 50% and 75% BG formulations, showed notable reductions in digestive enzyme activities and blood glucose levels, alongside increased activities of key antioxidant enzymes in the pancreas, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione transferase. Additionally, these diets restored nonenzymatic antioxidants, such as reduced glutathione and thiol groups, and significantly reduced reactive oxygen species, indicating reduced oxidative stress. Among all tested formulations, the 75BG bread demonstrated the most potent therapeutic benefits, surpassing even the standard drug acarbose in several parameters. The observed effects are attributed to the rich phenolic content of Bambara groundnut and orange peels, which act synergistically to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and bolster antioxidant defense. These findings highlight the potential of BG‐based functional foods in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus and underscore the need for further clinical research to support their application in both dietary and pharmaceutical contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Food spoilage and safety concerns still remain critically challenging within the fruit juice industry, especially as conventional detection methods, though precise, are often too time‐consuming, costly, and reliant on centralized laboratories. This review critically evaluates the potential of paper‐based biosensors as a transformative solution for real‐time, on‐site monitoring of fruit juice quality. The inherent versatility of paper‐based biosensors, with the integration of both colorimetric and electrochemical detection methods, has attracted interest due to their portability, cost‐effectiveness, ease of use, and high analytical resolution. Their widespread application in environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and food safety assessment underscores their analytical versatility. We examine the underlying spoilage mechanisms, including microbial contamination, enzymatic browning, nonenzymatic browning reactions, and pesticide residues, alongside paper‐based biosensor designs and fabrication techniques. By offering near‐instant feedback, paper‐based biosensors support better decision‐making in juice production, distribution, and consumption. This review describes and highlights current advancements and challenges in sensitivity and quantification, as well as emerging trends such as multiplexing and digital integration. Collectively, this review summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the paper as a matrix for sensors as well as its impact on their performance and applications, presents a short history of paper, and discusses fabrication methods and their functions.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background The scapula free flap is an unpopular option for osseous reconstruction of the head and neck in part due to the inability to perform simultaneous ablative surgery and harvesting of the free flap. In addition, it was originally described as having minimal bone stock making dental rehabilitation with dental implants very difficult. Methods Retrospective review from 2015 to 2025 of patients that underwent segmental resections involving the maxillofacial complex and received scapula free tissue transfer with dental implants. Contributing surgeons are affiliated with the following institutions: Northwell Health (Northwell Cancer Institute), University of Pittsburgh, Oregon Health &amp; Science University, Washington University in St. Louis, and the Medical University of South Carolina. Results Eighty‐seven dental implants were placed in 29 patients mainly using the angular branch of the thoracodorsal artery. Fifteen patients (51.7%) had their implants placed during the initial ablative and scapular reconstruction. The median number of dental implants placed in each scapula was two, and overall implant osseointegration was 88.8% after following patients on average for 41 months. Conclusion Our multi‐institution review has demonstrated that the scapula free flap has adequate bone quantity to support immediate and delayed dental implants to provide long term success for dental rehabilitation. We recognize that the sample size in this series is relatively small; however, this series represents one of the largest in the current literature.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Collisions between mobile machines and pedestrians persist across worksites despite widespread use of camera monitor systems (CMS) that satisfy current design requirements. This signalizes a potential specification‐to‐reality gap and a lack of human‐centered, field‐relevant design criteria for visibility aids in mobile machinery. This study addresses this gap using cognitive work analysis to model generic mobile machine operations in construction sites. Focusing on work domain analysis (WDA), an abstraction hierarchy was developed from document reviews, field observations, and subject‐matter expert interviews ( n = 5), and validated in two workshops ( n = 12). The abstraction hierarchy reveals dense means‐ends coupling: CMS effectiveness is highly sensitive to real‐world degradations, operator workload, and task dynamics. Based on this model, we clarify the constraints shaping near‐field pedestrian detection within the machine's hazard envelope and translate those constraints into a taxonomy of risk factors aligned with ISO 6385 work‐system design principles. By making these constraints explicit and measurable, our approach identifies leverage points that yield actionable recommendations for improving CMS design and use. This work enables future hypothesis‐driven experiments under representative conditions, supports targeted design interventions and training, and motivates updates to standards and test practices so that CMS performance better reflects field realities to promote safety.",

    "Abstract": "Women 30-59 years were allocated to either HPV-based screening or cytology-based screening in this Danish health care policy trial. The optimal triage of HPV-positive women could be a combination of cytology triage with HPV genotyping or p16/Ki67 staining. We report number of screen positives, colposcopies, and cervical lesions of three different triage algorithms (p16/Ki67, HPV16/18, or HPV16/18/31/33/52) in HPV-positive women with low-grade cytological abnormalities. We included 178,317 women with a sample in 2021 of which 91,517 were screened with HPV and 86,800 with cytology. All women were followed for 18 months. Almost three times as many women screened positive with HPV-based screening compared to cytology-based screening (RR 2.99, 95% 2.93-3.05) and colposcopies derived from the screening program were also more common (RR 1.68, 95% 1.63-1.73). p16/Ki67 triage resulted in more colposcopies (RR 1.86, 95% 1.76-1.95) than HPV16/18 (RR 1.54, 95% 1.44-1.65) and HPV16/18/31/33/52 (RR 1.63, 95% 1.55-1.71). The excess in colposcopy referrals was reduced when non-screening-derived colposcopies were included (intention-to-treat). Nevertheless, more women with CIN2 or worse were detected in the HPV group than in the cytology group per screened woman; in the p16/Ki67 triage group (RR 1.65, 95% 1.54-1.77), in the HPV16/18 group (RR 1.36, 95% 1.23-1.50), and in the HPV16/18/31/33/52 group (RR 1.48, 95% 1.37-1.59). HPV-based screening, as compared with cytology screening, resulted in more screen positives, but all three triage algorithms substantially reduced the excess number of referrals to colposcopy. p16/Ki67 compared to triage with HPV16/18 may detect more cervical lesions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Cervical cancer incidence has increased in several high‐income countries over the last decades. During the same period, many screening programs have shifted their primary method from cytology to the more sensitive HPV test. To better understand the increasing incidence, we visualized the incidence trends by mode of detection (screen‐detected, interval cancers, cancers in non‐participants, or cancers in those outside screening target ages) and by cancer morphology type using segmented regression. We also assessed the effects of the primary test method on the risk of screen‐detected and interval cancers using Poisson regression. The study population consisted of all individuals diagnosed with cervical cancer ( n = 4472) during 1996–2022 in Finland. An increase in cervical cancer incidence was observed during the 2010s, predominantly among individuals within the screening age. A clear upward trend was evident among both screening participants and non‐participants. Notably, the incidence of screen‐detected cervical cancer rose sharply after approximately 2013. The introduction of HPV‐based screening was associated with an increased detection rate of screen‐detected cancers (RR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.1–1.7) compared to cytology testing. Conversely, the risk of interval cervical cancer was reduced when the preceding screening method was an HPV test (RR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.21–0.38) compared to cytology. Our results imply that the initiation of HPV testing has improved the detection of prevalent cancers, but changes in risk factors also contribute to the rising incidence of cervical cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract We analysed reimbursement differences for prostate (PC), renal cell (RCC), and urothelial (UC) cancers drugs in Canada, France, England, Wales, Scotland, Spain, Italy, and Portugal, assessing substantial clinical benefit (SCB) and pivotal trials characteristics. This is a retrospective analysis of PC, RCC, and UC drug‐indication pairs (2005–2024). Approvals were identified via FDA and EMA. Reimbursement recommendations were reviewed. Primary endpoint was reimbursement rate by SCB, tumour type, and country. Trial characteristics, overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QoL) were analysed. SCB was defined by ESMO‐MCBS v1.1. Statistical significance set at p &lt; .05. Fifty‐five drug‐indication pairs for PC (20), RCC (20), and UC (15) were analysed. Most trials were randomized, open‐label, phase 3, and in the metastatic settings. Canada (PC: 85%, RCC: 75%, UC: 53%) and France (PC: 85%; RCC: 75%; UC: 33%) had highest reimbursement rates; while Portugal, lowest (PC: 65%; RCC: 50%; UC: 20%). Among SCB indications, PC reimbursement was highest in Canada, France, and Spain (91%), and lowest in England (64%). For RCC, was highest in Canada, France, and Italy (100%), and lowest in Portugal (57%). For UC, was highest in Canada (100%), and lowest in Wales and England (33%). OS was primary endpoint in 47% trials; QoL was assessed in 25%. OS benefit was observed in 53%; QoL in only 9%. This study reveals marked international variation in genitourinary cancer drug reimbursement, particularly in Europe and for UC—even for indications with SCB. Most trials lacked evidence of OS or QoL benefit.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Microplastics (MPs), diameter &lt; 5 mm, are becoming a major environmental health concern issue but there is still less information available about the exposure and toxicity of MPs on mammal health. In the current study, we assessed the effects of MPs, Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and Polystyrene (PS) toxicity on body weight, blood glucose, different blood parameters, and oxidative stress of Wistar albino rats. SEM analysis was performed for the characterization of PVC and PS MPs. In in vivo analysis, the rats were divided into five groups and four groups; Groups 2 to 5 were exposed to PVC and PS at different doses (300 and 1000 mg/kg), and Group 1 was used as a control group. After 8 weeks of exposure, the change in body weight and blood parameters was determined, which showed a significant alteration in the animals' bodies. The addition of polyvinyl chloride and polystyrene to the rats showed a significant decline in body weight (PVC 0.0021: PS 0.0055) and an increase in blood glucose (PVC 0.0006; PS 0.0009). The harmful effect was also analyzed on internal organs which depicted the increase in total cholesterol (PVC 0.0006; PS 0.0009), triglyceride (PVC 0.0001; PS 0.0026), low‐density lipoprotein (PVC 0.0226; PS 0.0051), alanine transaminase (PVC; PS &lt; 0.0001), albumin (PVC 0.0037; PS 0.0001), creatinine (PVC; PS &lt; 0.0001), uric acid (PVC 0.0009; PS 0.0014), superoxide dismutase (PVC 0.0025; PS 0.0017), malonaldehyde (PVC; PS &lt; 0.0001) whereas decrease in high density lipoprotein (PVC 0.0255; PS 0.0057), alkaline phosphatase (PVC; PS &lt; 0.0001) and catalase (PVC 0.0095; PS 0.030). Also, the histopathological analysis of the renal and hepatic tissue showed the toxicological effect of PVC and PS.

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The accuracy of pseudopotentials (PPs) in density functional theory (DFT) and time‐dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations has been studied previously. However, the performance of PPs including spin‐orbit coupling (SOC) for superheavy element compounds where SOC is very strong was rarely investigated. In this work, we report the performance of the small‐core energy‐consistent PPs developed by Stuttgart groups on the ground state bond lengths, force constants, dissociation energies in DFT calculations and on vertical excitation energies in TDDFT calculations for a series of closed‐shell superheavy element halides, compared with results obtained using all‐electron Dirac‐Coulomb(‐Gaunt) Hamiltonian. In most cases, results with the PPs are in good agreement with all‐electron results in scalar relativistic and SOC calculations. PP deviations are insensitive to the employed exchange‐correlation functionals in most cases. Effects of the basis set on these properties in PP calculations are very small. Our results indicate that reasonable DFT and TDDFT results can be given by such PPs for these superheavy elements halides.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The exploration of minimum energy crossing points (MEXs) between potential energy surfaces (PESs) is essential for understanding nonradiative decay mechanisms and plays a key role in the design of photofunctional materials. In lanthanide (Ln 3+ ) complexes, however, the presence of open‐shell 4f N electrons leads to quasi‐degenerate electronic states, making MEX searches particularly challenging. To describe the PESs of 4f‐5d or charge‐transfer excited states (i.e., 4f N −1 X excited states) of Ln 3+ complexes, we propose a new approximation, the ion energy shift (IES) method. In this approach, the 4f N −1 X excited state is represented using density functional theory (DFT) with the large‐core relativistic effective core potential (RECP) for Ln 4+ , which has a higher formal charge than the actual ion (Ln 3+ ), and the PES is shifted to reproduce the target excitation energy. In this study, we validate the IES method against the multiconfigurational wavefunction results and apply it to elucidate the origin of the different excited‐state lifetimes of hydrated Ce 3+ complexes with and without coordination of a carboxylate ligand.",

    "Abstract": "Periodontitis, or inflammatory gum disease, affects many adults in the United States and worldwide. Various factors, such as smoking and diabetes mellitus, increase the risk of periodontitis and the severity of its symptoms. To determine if periodontitis occurs more commonly and is more severe according to patient age and sex, the study used health records from almost 8,000 patients attending dental clinics at the University of Texas School of Dentistry (Houston, TX) from 2007 to 2020. The results demonstrated that adult patients who were older or males had periodontitis more often than those who were younger or female, respectively. Periodontitis was also more severe in older or male patients. These results show that older adults and males can be considered vulnerable individuals when it comes to diagnosing periodontitis. Therefore, dentists should pay more attention to these patients, and individualized treatment methods need to be considered for providing dental care to the gums of these patients.",

    "Abstract": "When treating severe gum disease, dentists often combine deep cleaning with antibiotics to help eliminate harmful bacteria. However, the best time to give these antibiotics-at the start or the end of the cleaning process-has never been tested. This study compared two approaches in 68 patients with advanced gum disease: one group received antibiotics during their cleaning sessions over 2 weeks, while the other received them immediately after cleaning finished. Both groups showed similar improvements in gum health after 1 year, with about over half achieving successful treatment outcomes. However, analyzing the bacterial communities revealed an interesting difference: patients who started antibiotics early experienced faster and more thorough changes in their mouth bacteria. Their harmful bacteria disappeared more quickly, and beneficial bacteria formed a stable, protective community sooner. In contrast, the late-antibiotic group showed slower bacterial changes, with beneficial bacteria remaining mixed with harmful ones for longer. While both timing strategies work clinically, starting antibiotics at the beginning of treatment may help to establish a healthier, more stable bacterial community in the gums, potentially offering better long-term protection against disease recurrence.",

    "Abstract": "Tranexamic acid (TXA) is widely used across surgical specialties to reduce perioperative blood loss, yet its specific role in hepatic resection remains unclear. This meta-analysis, performed according to PRISMA guidelines, evaluated the efficacy and safety of TXA in liver surgery. Outcomes of interest included mean intraoperative blood loss, the proportion of patients receiving transfusion, and mean units of red blood cells transfused intraoperatively and postoperatively. Secondary endpoints included postoperative mortality, thromboembolic events, and hospital length of stay. Of 36 articles assessed, nine studies met eligibility criteria for inclusion. TXA use was associated with a statistically significant reduction in intraoperative blood loss (SMD - 0.18; 95% CI, - 0.28 to - 0.09; p < 0.01), although transfusion requirements did not differ significantly between groups (RR 0.81; 95% CI, 0.47-1.38; p = 0.44). Interpretation of these findings is limited by substantial heterogeneity among included studies (I² = 82%). While TXA appears effective in reducing intraoperative bleeding, its use may confer a higher risk of postoperative thromboembolic complications, suggesting that TXA administration during hepatic resection should be selective and individualized rather than routine.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) individuals experience elevated rates of trauma exposure, minority stress, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Yet, research examining how geographic location and LGBTQ+ identity shape PTSD outcomes is scant, particularly studies considering structural facilitators and barriers, such as health care access. This cross‐sectional, secondary study investigated associations between several individual‐ and structural‐level factors and PTSD symptoms in LGBTQ+ adults ( N = 131) recruited from urban and rural U.S. regions, most of whom identified as non‐Hispanic White, bisexual, cisgender women. Analyses examined whether intersecting demographic characteristics, urban or rural location, perceived health care access, LGBTQ+ identity disclosure to providers, and experiences of LGBTQ+ discrimination were associated with PTSD symptom severity and probable PTSD diagnosis. Approximately 62% of participants reported experiencing a DSM‐5 Criterion A traumatic event; of these individuals, 24.4% met the criteria for probable PTSD. General health care access, β = −.27, 95% CI [−.45, −.09], p = .003, and LGBTQ+ identity disclosure, β = −.19, 95% CI [−.31, −.07], p = .039, were significantly associated with PTSD symptom severity. Higher health care access was associated with 50.0% lower odds of probable PTSD, OR adj = 0.50, 95% CI [0.29, 0.84], p = .009. Bisexual cisgender women had 4‐times higher odds of a probable PTSD diagnosis compared to LGQ+ participants, OR adj = 3.96, 95% CI [1.15, 13.7], p = .030. Improving access to health care and supporting identity disclosure may reduce PTSD risk among LGBTQ+ adults, especially for bisexual cisgender women and rurally situated individuals.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Access to (urban) nature is vital for people's wellbeing, but this accessibility is not evenly spread across socio‐demographic groups, nor across the European continent. This paper fills a research gap by exploring the use patterns and accessibility of forests and parks across European cities, based on a standardised online survey of 10,462 people from 33 European countries. The results highlight a complex relationship between accessibility, socio‐demographic factors and personal motivations in shaping the use of forests and parks. Key findings include variations in visiting patterns by age and gender, with younger individuals and women showing a higher propensity for frequent visits. Motivations for forest and park use varied widely, ranging from physical health and recreation to social interaction and mental well‐being. Importantly, the study identified accessibility challenges, particularly travel time, connectivity and limited amenities (e.g. safe walking/cycling routes, lighting, toilets), which limit park and forest use. The results also highlight the diversity in use patterns across different European regions and based on gender, revealing significant variations in how people value and use forests and parks. The study suggests that socio‐demographic factors, accessibility and personal motivations play crucial roles in determining forest and park use, underscoring the importance of inclusive urban planning to accommodate diverse needs and preferences.

In this study, the modified polyurethane (IPU) is synthesized using polycaprolactone diol (PCL), 4,4′‐diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI), and 1,4‐butanediol (BDO) as raw materials, with itaconic anhydride (IA) incorporated to react with the terminal hydroxyl polyurethane prepolymer (Pre‐PU). The effects of different IA contents on the structure, crystallization behavior, and properties of the IPU are systematically investigated. The results show that the IPU with 12 mol% IA exhibits the highest degree of hydrogen bonding, a relatively lower soft segment crystallinity, and a more developed microphase‐separated structure. This formulation demonstrates optimal overall performance, including enhanced tensile strength and elongation at break (13.9 MPa and 672.2%, respectively), good damping properties, and the least reduction in hydrophobicity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Research Summary We study how the entry of a rival platform affects the strategies of the incumbent's complementors. The latter face a trade‐off: While the entry threatens their benefits from indirect network effects, it also allows them to escape intense within‐platform competition. Studying Epic Games' entry into the PC video game market—until then dominated by Steam—we show that this trade‐off does not resolve uniformly, driving heterogeneity in strategic reactions. Complementors with weaker strategic resources (independent developers) were more likely to multihome and became less responsive to the incumbent's attempts to orchestrate collective action through platform‐wide sales promotions. In contrast, complementors more reliant on indirect network effects (multiplayer developers) were less likely to multihome and became more responsive to orchestration attempts. Managerial Summary As competition between digital platforms intensifies, complementors—firms that provide complementary products or services—must adjust how they engage with platform owners. The entry of a rival platform creates both opportunities and risks: it offers an alternative with less intense competition but also fragments the user base that underpins network benefits. We find that these opposing effects shape complementors' behavior differently. Those with fewer strategic resources are more likely to join the new platform and become less willing to follow the incumbent's coordinated initiatives. In contrast, complementors whose products rely strongly on network effects tend to remain with the incumbent and cooperate more closely with its orchestration efforts. For managers, this highlights that platform competition not only shifts market dynamics but also reshapes the motivations and strategies of heterogeneous complementors.",

    "Abstract": "Nanofluidic membranes with precise ion selectivity and ultrahigh permeability are central to advancing electromembrane technologies for energy generation, storage, water purification, and environmental monitoring. The performance of these systems hinges on the ability of membranes to efficiently and selectively transport ions. However, synthetic ion-selective membranes (ISMs) face a fundamental trade-off: increasing ion selectivity typically reduces permeability, and vice versa. Overcoming this trade-off is essential for realizing next-generation ISMs with enhanced performance. This review summarizes recent progress in addressing the selectivity-permeability trade-off through innovative membrane architectures, advanced fabrication methods, material engineering strategies, and modeling tools that clarify structure-property-performance relationships. Biological ion channels serve as benchmarks, offering ultra-efficient ion transport via precise control of pore size, surface charge, pathway length, and rectification effects. Drawing on these natural systems, we highlight bio-inspired strategies for enhancing synthetic membrane performance. We also discuss the role of ISMs in electrochemical applications and assess remaining challenges in achieving high ion flux without compromising selectivity. Emerging solutions including hybrid membrane systems, advanced nanomaterials, and AI-assisted design present promising pathways forward. The review concludes by outlining future directions that integrate computational modeling with experimental validation to develop efficient, scalable, and sustainable membrane technologies.",

    "Abstract": "Mesoporous zeolite-anchored atomically dispersed metal (ADM) catalysts are capable of overcoming diffusion limitations, promoting mass transfer, and exposing more active sites. These features make them one of the most ideal heterogeneous catalysts. However, introducing both mesoporosity and ADM species into zeolite structures while avoiding metal clustering remains a significant challenge. Herein, we report the hierarchical MFI zeolite encapsulated atomically dispersed nickel species using a ligand-protected in situ synthesis strategy with a tri-functional template. This template incorporates quaternary ammonium hydrophilic head groups linked to central metal-coordinated porphyrins by alkyl chains, which guide the formation of mesoporous MFI zeolite structure while simultaneously suppressing nickel clustering. The resulting catalyst exhibits a hierarchical architecture comprising MFI nanosheets with enhanced 90° rotational intergrowth, and the dispersed Ni sites are evenly distributed within the zeolite framework. The catalyst exhibited a high activity and efficient utilization of Ni in probing CO<sub>2</sub> hydrogenation reaction. The use of functionalized metal-coordinated porphyrins as a structure-directing agent to generate zeolite-supported metal catalysts is transferable, which opens new possibilities for controlling zeolite architecture.",

    "Abstract": "With the growing demand for precise and minimally invasive intracellular delivery, photoporation has emerged as a powerful non-viral strategy. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of photoporation as a versatile intracellular delivery platform, with particular emphasis on the role of micro- and nanostructured materials in enabling efficient transport across a wide range of biomolecular sizes. A key novelty of this review is its size-centric organizational framework, which systematically classifies photoporation strategies based on biomolecular cargo size, from small molecules and nucleic acids to ultralarge assemblies and bacteria, rather than conventional material- or laser-based categorizations. The review examines laser-induced mechanisms responsible for transient membrane permeabilization and highlights critical material parameters, including composition, size, shape, surface charge, and optical properties, that govern light-matter interactions and delivery efficiency. Comparative evaluation of micro- and nanostructured materials across different size regimes provides a practical framework for rational material selection and platform design. In addition, key challenges related to delivery precision, biocompatibility, scalability, and clinical translation are critically discussed alongside emerging optimization strategies. By integrating mechanistic insights with translational considerations, this review provides a structured roadmap for developing safe, efficient, and size-adaptive photoporation platforms for biological research and therapeutic applications.",

    "Abstract": "Metal-free phthalocyanines (Pcs) have rarely been explored in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to poor solubility and limited processability. Here, we introduce CG-0, a fully substituted metal-free Pc bearing peripheral chlorine atoms and non-peripheral ethoxy chains that confer exceptional solubility, near-infrared absorption, and photochemical robustness. As an additive in wide-bandgap (WBG) PSCs, CG-0 promotes high-quality crystallization, passivates defects, and suppresses non-radiative recombination. Strikingly, ultra-high doping levels (1.75 mm) are tolerated without performance loss, yielding a PCE of 20.41% with an FF of 83.2% under AM 1.5G, and a PCE of 38.60% with an FF of 82.2% under 1000 lux white LED. At high loadings, CG-0 also imparts a vivid, tunable film color, enabling aesthetic and multifunctional device designs. This work establishes a rational molecular design paradigm in which solubility-driven processability, multi-point defect passivation, and interfacial stabilization are integrated into a single additive. The approach not only delivers record WBG PSC efficiencies under both solar and indoor light, but also breaks the constraint of fixed device appearance, opening avenues toward efficient, color-adaptive perovskite photovoltaics.",

    "Abstract": "The by-products of thermally processed foods, carbon quantum dots (CQDs), pose unpredictable risks to human health due to their nanoscale size and abundant surface functional groups that can readily accumulate in organs. Herein, mice were oral-exposed to grilled lamb-derived CQDs (25 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) for 9 weeks. The results indicated that CQDs exposure resulted in liver and intestinal barrier injury, as well as an increase in intestinal microbiota-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CQDs exposure directly and indirectly upregulated the expression of bile acid (BA) synthesis genes (Cyp7a1, Cyp8b1, and Cyp27a1) by activating MyD88 in the intestinal LPS-TLR4 pathway, as well as MyD88 and NFκB, downstream molecules of LPS-TLR4 pathway in the liver, leading to increased BA synthesis. Concurrently, the expression of BA excretion genes Bsep and Mrp2 was downregulated, contributing to cholestasis. With prolonged exposure, the levels of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) inhibitor tauro-β-muricholic acid increased, while that of agonists chenodeoxycholic acid and taurochenodeoxycholic acid decreased, further exacerbating cholestasis. Supplementation with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ATCC8014 mitigated cholestasis by reducing the relative abundance of g_Flexispira, increasing the relative abundance of g_Adlercreutzia, and remodeling the intestinal barrier. This study provides substantial evidence for the comprehensive assessment, control, and intervention regarding the hepatotoxicity of foodborne CQDs.",

    "Abstract": "Microfabricated stiffness gradient hydrogels hold significant value for advancing mechanobiology, tissue engineering, and in vitro tissue models. However, it remains challenging to design these materials given their broad processing parameter space. The continuum of stiffness values also makes it difficult to precisely correlate the local substrate properties and observed biological responses, often relying on cumbersome characterization methods such as atomic force microscopy. To address these bottlenecks, we present a straightforward thermophoresis-based fabrication strategy to pattern stiffness gradients in a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled hydrogel network, which displays a polymer concentration-dependent fluorescence readout. This approach enables quantitative assessment of the gradient formation process and contactless stiffness mapping via standard microscopy imaging. Using gelatin methacryloyl and Gellan gum as model systems, it is shown that substrate stiffness and extracellular matrix protein composition work together to affect 3T3-L1 fibroblast cell morphology and migration, with the underlying hydrogel type also affecting the outcome. By offering a simple and reliable approach for characterizing stiffness gradient hydrogels, this work advances the thermophoretic fabrication platform, opening avenues for new biomaterial systems for understanding and controlling the cell-material interplay.",

    "Abstract": "Clinical translation of dissolving microneedles (DMNs) is hindered by critical challenges such as drug diffusion into the backing layer during fabrication and slow dissolution rates, which compromise dose accuracy, delivery efficiency, and user compliance. Although lyophilization has emerged as a strategy to accelerate microneedle dissolution by inducing a porous, amorphous microstructure, the resulting mechanical fragility limits effective skin insertion. To overcome these issues, we developed a Lyophilized Microneedle System using Biocompatible Glue (LMS-BG), wherein a lyophilized, drug-loaded microneedle tip is coupled with a prefabricated backing via a biodegradable, ethanol-based glue (BC glue). This system enables tip-localized drug confinement, rapid dissolution, and mechanical reinforcement through partial interpenetration of BC glue into the porous tip. Using lidocaine hydrochloride (LiH) as a model drug, LMS-BG exhibited an 11-fold faster dissolution rate than conventional DMNs, with over 96% of the drug retained in the tip and a transdermal delivery efficiency exceeding 90% within 2 min. In vivo studies in rats confirmed superior local anesthetic efficacy and biocompatibility of LMS-BG compared to commercial lidocaine gel. Furthermore, the LMS-BG fabrication method was successfully extended to various microneedle platforms using soluble polymers, hydrogels, and PLGA nanoparticles, demonstrating its scalability and versatility. Overall, the LMS-BG platform addresses key translational barriers of conventional DMNs and presents a modular strategy for rapid, efficient, and clinically viable transdermal drug delivery.",

    "Abstract": "The photocatalytic performance of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is often restricted by the inefficient utilization of photogenerated charge carriers. Achieving precise regulation of their electronic structures to facilitate charge separation and transport remains a great challenge. Herein, two regioisomeric COFs bearing pyrene units substituted at the 1,6- or 2,7-positions were rationally designed and synthesized to elucidate the influence of isomerism on electron distribution and photocatalytic behavior. Despite their comparable chemical composition and framework topology, the two regioisomeric COFs exhibited distinct photocatalytic activities. The 2,7-substituted P-COF exhibited a remarkable hydrogen evolution rate of 12.3 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, whereas the 1,6-substituted D-COF displayed only negligible activity of 0.42 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, P-COF achieved a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generation rate of 4.25 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup> using benzyl alcohol as sacrificial agent, much higher than that of D-COF (0.64 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>).

    "Abstract": "Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are promising for high energy density but suffer from safety issues, dendrite growth and interfacial instability. Deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) offer potential solutions, yet their practical application is limited by their unsatisfactory interfacial compatibility. This study develops a non-flammable quasi-solid electrolyte for LMBs, via incorporating a novel 3,3'-[oxybis(2,1-ethanediyloxy)]bispropanenitrile (OCN)-based DEE into a poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) matrix, denoted as OCN-PBA. By integrating both cyano and ether functional groups, the designed OCN molecule enables dual stabilization of both the cathode and anode interfaces, as the cyano group enhances oxidation stability while the ether chains improve lithium compatibility. OCN-PBA possesses a unique aggregated solvation structure, which results in a high ionic conductivity (2.0 × 10<sup>-4</sup> S cm<sup>-1</sup>), a Li<sup>+</sup> transference number (0.66), and a wide electrochemical window (5.0 V). Consequently, Li|OCN-PBA|Li symmetric cell delivers stable plating/stripping over 1500 h, and Li|OCN-PBA|LiFePO<sub>4</sub> cell demonstrates over 2000 stable cycles. Moreover, the OCN-PBA enables excellent cyclic stability in high-voltage Li|LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.1</sub>Mn<sub>0.1</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Li|LiCoO<sub>2</sub> cells. This work proposes a novel electrolyte design strategy, providing a feasible approach for developing practical high-performance LMBs with improved safety.",

    "Abstract": "Although modulating the d-band center (ε<sub>d</sub>) is an effective strategy to improve electrocatalytic activity, precise regulation of ε<sub>d</sub> for CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction to CO remains a substantial challenge. Here, we report a heterostructured catalyst consisting of In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-incorporated 3D nanowire copper foam (Cu<sub>2</sub>O/In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>@CF), with tunable ε<sub>d</sub> via Cu-O-In bridges for efficient electrocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> reduction (eCO<sub>2</sub>R) to CO. The optimized Cu<sub>2</sub>O/In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>@CF delivers impressive CO Faradaic efficiency (FE<sub>CO</sub>) exceeding 90% over a broad potential range from -0.47 to -0.87 V (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE), with a peak FE<sub>CO</sub> of 95.8% at -0.67 V (vs. RHE), and a high production rate of 1035.3 µmol cm<sup>-2</sup> h<sup>-1</sup>, along with stable operation for over 130 h. In situ Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the formation of Cu<sub>2</sub>O/In<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> heterointerface with Cu-O-In bridge facilitates charge redistribution, upshifting the ε<sub>d</sub> of Cu sites and downshifting that of In sites, thereby optimizing the adsorption-desorption energies of reaction intermediates during eCO<sub>2</sub>R.

    "Abstract": "Cuproptosis, a newly identified form of regulated cell death, relies on copper ions and elevated mitochondrial respiration. This study elucidates the role of lactate oxidase in modulating cuproptosis by converting lactate to pyruvate, reprogramming energy metabolism, and thereby facilitating copper-induced cell death. Here, this work develops a copper-coordinated polymer for efficient delivery of lactate oxidase into cancer cells. The nanoparticles modulate the activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, and reshape the energy metabolism of tumor cells. This metabolic reprogramming initiates a boost in mitochondrial function that subsequently promotes cuproptosis through copper-dependent dihydrolipoamide S-acetyltransferase (DLAT) oligomerization and disruption of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. In addition to inducing cuproptosis, the nanoparticles also activate a noniron-dependent Fenton-like reaction, thereby promoting ferroptosis. The nanoparticles exhibit potent antitumor efficacy in vivo, underscoring the potential of exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities to enhance cuproptosis. This study introduces a novel therapeutic avenue that leverages metabolic reprogramming to initiate regulated cell death pathways in cancer treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Peptide-based self-assembled nanostructures offer great promise for targeted drug delivery due to their intrinsic biocompatibility, biodegradability, and structural tunability. However, their limited optical properties and lack of functional sites for selective targeting restrict their use in theranostics. Here, we report a fluorophore-integrated, pH-responsive dipeptide nanocarrier engineered from phenylalanine-tryptophan (F-W) conjugated with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzofurazan (NBD) as a fluorescent probe and vitamin B6 (VitB6) as a pH-sensitive unit. The resulting vitamin B6-modified nanoparticles (PS-Dox) exhibited charge reversal from negative to positive under mildly acidic conditions (pH 5.0), promoting doxorubicin (Dox) release, endosomal escape, and nuclear localization. PS-Dox demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity, DNA damage, and apoptosis induction in multiple cancer cell lines, while showing negligible toxicity toward non-malignant cardiomyocytes (AC-16 and H9C2). In vivo biodistribution and pharmacokinetic studies revealed increased tumour accumulation and superior tumour growth inhibition compared with Dox. Importantly, PS-mediated encapsulation effectively mitigated Dox-associated cardiotoxicity, a major limitation of conventional chemotherapy. Overall, this study establishes a vitamin B6-mediated, charge-reversible peptide nanocarrier as a biocompatible and efficient platform for targeted anticancer drug delivery, combining tumour-specific therapeutic efficacy with improved cardiac safety.",

    "Abstract": "The development of hard carbon (HC) anode is severely hindered by limited Na<sup>+</sup> storage capacity and poor cycling stability, which are closely related to its microstructure and interface. In this work, a synergistic microstructure-interface modulation strategy is demonstrated to regulate the Na<sup>+</sup> storage active sites and structural stability of resin-based HC. The introduced C═O enables reversible Na<sup>+</sup> adsorption, while carboxyl and neighboring phenolic hydroxyl functional groups anchor the template metal ions (Zn<sup>2+</sup>), thereby constructing a hierarchical pore structure with abundant sites for reversible Na<sup>+</sup> storage. Additionally, expanded interlayer spacing promotes the kinetics of reversible Na<sup>+</sup> intercalation/deintercalation. Based on this strategy, the optimized HC material (ZGB-HC) exhibits an extra-high capacity of 406 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> at 50 mA g<sup>-1</sup> and maintains exceptional cycling stability of over 1000 cycles for 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>.

    "Abstract": "Purifying ethylene from ternary acetylene/ethylene/ethane (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>/C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) mixture in one-step requires preferential adsorption for C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, which is challenging due to the intermediate physicochemical property of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. To address this problem, a synergistic host-guest interaction strategy is proposed for metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) by taking open metal site (OMS) to preferentially bind with electron-rich C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> through π-coordination interaction, while saturated hydrocarbon C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> primarily adsorbed via C-H∙∙∙π interactions with aromatic rings (AR). The feasibility of this strategy was demonstrated by three conformational isomeric 8-connected [Fe<sub>3</sub>(µ<sub>3</sub>-O)(COO)<sub>6</sub>] trigonal prismatic trinuclear cluster-based robust MOFs (denoted as SNNU-705-α/β/γ regulated by amino groups). Combining one unoccupied OMS site and occupying AR groups in SNNU-705-α/β/γ boosts the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> affinity and binds C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> the weakest. Aided by amino Lewis basic sites (LBSs) furtherly, SNNU-705-γ exhibits the highest C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> uptake at 298 K and 1 atm (6.13 mmol g<sup>-1</sup>) among all reported MOFs for one-step C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> purification.

This study presents an all-inorganic flexible membrane fabricated via a facile electrospinning technique, which strategically embeds hollow silica (SiO<sub>2</sub>) microspheres (HSMs) within a scaffold of SiO<sub>2</sub> nanofibers (SNF). This design yields a 3D self-lubricating architecture that confers extraordinary mechanical durability, withstanding over 100 000 bending cycles under 99% strain and 72 h of vibration without significant weight loss-a performance that surpasses conventional ceramics by orders of magnitude. Simultaneously, the composite membrane exhibits an ultralow and stable thermal conductivity of 31.39 mW m<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, together with a high specific airflow resistance of 122.11 (kPa S m<sup>-1</sup>) mm<sup>-1</sup>, synergistically inhibiting heat conduction and convection. The SNF/HSMs composite membrane demonstrates exceptional thermal resilience, enduring long-term exposure at 1100°C and surviving drastic thermal shocks from 1300°C to -196°C. When evaluated in a practical flame test at 700°C, a mere 5-mm-thick membrane effectively maintains a low backside temperature of ≈160°C.

    "Abstract": "In the domain of evaporation to electricity conversion, current research efforts are primarily focused on optimizing the permselectivity and evaporation efficiency of the fluid transferring medium. Here, we demonstrate that the output power of evaporation-induced energy harvesting devices can be significantly enhanced using suitable electrodes that complement the charge separation process and improve the ionic-electronic current conversion efficiency. The proof of concept was demonstrated by fabricating an energy device with the nanofluidic membrane of montmorillonite clay (MC-M). Upon replacing typically used Cu electrodes with surface-modified graphitic carbon strips with positively charged TiO<sub>2</sub> nanowires as the bottom electrode, and negatively charged Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanowires as the top electrode, nearly 8000 times enhancement in the power output was observed. Unlike redox-active metals, metal oxide nanostructures applied in the MC-M device are not consumed in the charge conversion process. Finally, replacing liquid water with a modified block of pottery clay as a self-replenishing water source at the bottom of the MC-M device improved the long-term device stability (uninterrupted power output up to 8 h) in addition to addressing issues like inconveniences of water replacement, variations in water levels, and dissolution of the charge-selective medium.",

The SAF fabric exhibit high emissivity (96.1%) within the atmospheric window and high reflectivity (92.3%) within the solar spectrum, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of solar radiation on human thermal balance. Additionally, the fibers exhibit an internal porosity of ∼93.9%, which functions to reduce the penetration of external heat and facilitates the instantaneous absorption (over 80% of self-weight) and evaporation (∼5.7 g h<sup>-1</sup>) of sweat through capillary effect, thereby further enhancing the dissipation of heat from human body. The continuous and scalable technical routes also endow SAFs with outstanding mechanical strength, water resistance, and breathability. Practical application tests demonstrate that the temperature of SAF fabric is ∼10.6°C lower than the commercialized cotton fabric under direct sunlight (solar irradiation: ∼1511 W m<sup>-2</sup>) and ∼12.0°C under the simultaneous action of direct sunlight (solar irradiation: ∼1091 W m<sup>-2</sup>) and simulated sweat infiltration.

A total of 360 Cobb 500 broilers were assigned to six treatment groups (3 replicates of 20 birds), and from Day 14 to 35, birds received water supplemented with either probiotic, synbiotic or control. On Day 14, challenged groups received a 10× dose of Eimeria from a commercial live vaccine. Data were analyzed using a 2×3 factorial ANOVA. Eimeria challenge significantly reduced average weight gain, final body weight and feed conversion efficiency. Intestinal morphology was adversely affected, as evidenced by decreased villus height (VH) and villus height to crypt depth ratio (VCR) in both the duodenum and jejunum. Eimeria challenge also induced significant alterations in serum biochemical parameters, including alkaline phosphatase, albumin, urea, lipase and triglyceride levels. Probiotic and synbiotic supplementation significantly improved relative spleen weight, intestinal length (jejunum, ileum, cecum) and villus morphology in all intestinal segments. Significant main effects of treatment were observed for growth and serum enzymes. Interaction between coccidiosis infection and treatment was significant for urea, and duodenal VH and VCR.

    "Abstract": "A novel, doubly functionalized, tris‐cylometallated iridium complex ( 2 ) was synthesized and investigated. The target complex was prepared by the bromination of a parent structure [Ir(ppy) 2 fppy] ( 1 ) containing two unsubstituted 2‐phenylpyridine ligands and one formyl substituted 2‐phenylpyridine ligand. Selective introduction of the bromine atoms onto the unsubstituted 2‐phenylpyridine ligands was achieved in para position relative to the cyclometallated carbon. The introduction of these substituents resulted in the modification of the photophysical and electrochemical properties in complex 2 in comparison to the starting complex 1 . DFT calculations indicate that the change in these properties is since the bromine substituents stabilize the HOMO orbital of complex 2 to a greater extent than the LUMO orbital, in comparison to complex 1 . The possibility of complex 2 being used as a building block for more functionalized iridium complexes was demonstrated through a combination of palladium catalyzed Suzuki‐Miyaura cross‐coupling and reductive amination reactions.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT To manage ex situ breeding populations effectively, it is important to understand the factors that may lead to reproductive failure. In this study, we aim to understand factors associated with reproductive success in zoo‐housed bush dogs (Speothos venaticus) , and form evidence‐based recommendations for their breeding management. We distributed a survey to global institutions housing bush dogs to collect data on factors which may affect litter survival. Responses were obtained from 30 zoos across 13 countries, providing data on 125 litter births between 2012 and 2022. Information from the Zoological Information Management System (ZIMS) and studbook records supplemented this dataset. We found that within northern temperate regions, the number of pups reared to the age of 1 month in bush dog litters ( n = 112 litters) is linked to the ages of breeding individuals, prior breeding experience of females and birth season. The number of pups reared per litter declines with advancing maternal age, but this decline can be reduced by pairing with an older male; experienced females rear more pups per litter than inexperienced females, and litters born in the summer have better survival outcomes than other seasons. Sharing data between zoos provides greater statistical power to identify challenges associated with breeding lesser‐researched species, allowing zoos to overcome these challenges through evidence‐based management changes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Regulation of vascular endothelial permeability is crucial for maintaining hemostasis and controlling extravasation of immune cells in response to injury or infection. A transient increase in vascular permeability is a vital response to inflammation, allowing neutrophils to invade the inflamed tissue and clear the pathogen. Findings The close interaction between neutrophils and the activated, inflamed endothelium, followed by leukocyte trafficking across the endothelial layer, can, however, also contribute to maladaptive vascular hyperpermeability. This increased permeability allows plasma proteins and fluid to escape into the surrounding tissue, leading to edema, a hallmark and frequent complication of many inflammatory disorders. Neutrophils also contribute to the resolution of inflammation by restricting further neutrophil recruitment through chemokine degradation, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and by promoting their own apoptosis via the release of pro-apoptotic microparticles. Neutrophils, therefore, also contribute to the regulation of vascular permeability and to the restoration of tissue homeostasis in inflammatory conditions. Implications This review summarizes the known mechanisms by which neutrophils regulate acute and chronic vascular permeability in autoimmune and non-autoimmune inflammatory diseases, and highlights the potential translational implications. Finally, we discuss overlapping and distinct mechanisms in neutrophil trafficking and vascular permeability.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Aims/hypothesis The role of red meat in type 1 diabetes risk remains unclear. We examined whether maternal and early-life red meat intake is associated with the development of type 1 diabetes and whether such associations are modified by genetic susceptibility. Methods We analysed data from 15,717 children participating in the All Babies In Southeast Sweden (ABIS) cohort, followed for type 1 diabetes diagnosis via national registers until the age of 24–26 years. Dietary intake was assessed through food frequency questionnaires during pregnancy and at ages 1, 2.5 and 5 years. Cox models estimated adjusted HRs and 95% CIs for type 1 diabetes in relation to red meat, including beef, pork and sausage, analysed as high vs low intake frequency and per serving/week. Analyses were stratified by HLA risk genotype and family history of type 1 diabetes. Results Frequency of red meat intake during pregnancy or at age 1 was not associated with type 1 diabetes risk. The corresponding HRs per serving/week were 0.98 (95% CI 0.90, 1.07) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.88, 1.08), respectively. In type-specific analyses, higher frequency of beef intake at age 5 was associated with an increased risk of type 1 diabetes (HR 1.29 [95% CI 1.05, 1.58]), with a similar tendency for exposure at age 2.5 (HR 1.12 [95% CI 0.93, 1.36]). The association at age 5 was evident among children with high-risk HLA genotypes (HR 1.40 [95% CI 1.11, 1.78]) or a family history of type 1 diabetes (HR 1.56 [95% CI 1.08, 2.26]). In contrast, no statistically significant association was observed among children with low-risk HLA genotypes (HR 0.34 [95% CI 0.10, 1.19]) or without a family history of type 1 diabetes (HR 1.20 [95% CI 0.92, 1.56]). No associations were found for higher frequency of beef consumption during pregnancy or at age 1, nor for pork and sausage at any age. Conclusions/interpretation Childhood beef consumption may contribute to type 1 diabetes development in genetically at-risk individuals. Further research is needed to confirm this finding and clarify underlying mechanisms. Graphical Abstract",

Using a systematic thematic analysis, we identify key themes across ethical, legal, and social categories, as well as practical barriers to adoption and implementation. Findings reveal a range of concerns (e.g. lack of empirical validation of DT value propositions) and gaps between the promise of healthcare DTs and the reality of deploying them within existing healthcare systems. By mapping the identified barriers to the Non-adoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) framework, we seek to demonstrate how healthcare DTs require systematic assurance and capability development. We provide practical recommendations for how this can be achieved, with specified stakeholder groups, to help build trustworthy and ethical DTs with demonstrable healthcare value.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction and Hypothesis Recent evidence supports the clinical and economic advantages of the Manchester procedure (MP) over sacrospinous hysteropexy (SSH) in women treated for mild to moderate uterine prolapse. However, its use remains inconsistent, resulting in a notable variation in current practice. This study explores gynecologists’ barriers and facilitators to adoption of the MP, aiming to guide the development of a targeted implementation strategy. Methods From March to June 2025, we conducted semi-structured interviews with gynecologists ( n = 12) from the Netherlands in different stages of implementation to identify barriers and facilitators. The updated Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) guided data collection and analysis, ensuring a structured assessment of key domains. Results A total of 12 barriers and 20 facilitators were identified in 13 constructs across all CFIR domains. Key facilitators for implementation included strong regional collaboration networks, the low complexity of the surgical technique, peer-driven motivation to align with national trends, and overall trust in the evidence, although the latter varied between clinicians. Main barriers were the personal and organizational effort required for training and implementation, particularly in the absence of an experienced colleague, satisfaction with SSH results, and concerns about lower reimbursement for the MP. Conclusions This study identified key barriers and facilitators influencing the adoption of the MP from the perspective of gynecologists, emphasizing the clinical, organizational, and financial factors involved. Addressing these barriers and leveraging facilitators could enhance adoption of the MP, potentially improving treatment outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.",

    "Abstract": "Phosphorus is commonly part of the diets in developed countries, both as a natural component of protein-rich foods and as a food additive. Consumption of food containing high amounts of phosphate as a food additive has continued to rise over time, resulting in increasing dietary exposure to phosphate. In 2019, an evaluation of phosphoric acid and phosphates conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified young populations as groups with exposures exceeding the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI), and also raised concern that the current ADI may not be sufficiently protective for individuals with an impaired renal function, which may account for 10% of the general population. The Senate Commission on Food Safety (SKLM) of the German Research Foundation (DFG) critically reviewed the safety of dietary phosphate, with a particular focus on the kidney as the primary target organ, taking into account the occurrence and content of phosphate in food, the most recent exposure estimates, the bioavailability of phosphate from different sources, the evidence linking excessive phosphate intake to kidney damage in animal models and humans as well as the exceedance of the current ADI in children. Moreover, the SKLM identified data gaps and research needs that should be addressed to improve the risk assessment of phosphate, with a special focus on vulnerable population groups. Based on the presented evidence, the Commission concludes that excessive dietary phosphate intake warrants further attention regarding possible health effects in vulnerable population groups or at exposure levels exceeding the ADI. Finally, the SKLM suggests a battery of risk management measures to reduce dietary exposure to phosphate, particularly in infants, toddlers and children, and to protect patients with chronic renal diseases.",

    "Abstract": "We herein present the development and application of a forensic mass spectrometry-based procedure simultaneously targeting hard keratins from human hair adducted with sulfur mustard (SM) and its structural analogues sesquimustard (Q) and O-lost (T). These alkylating chemicals represent blister agents banned by the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The procedure was applied to an authentic hair sample of an SM-poisoned patient and thus allowed for the first time the proof of exposure to SM based on keratin adducts in a real case of poisoning. Whereas adducts of SM were detected, those of Q and T were not found. Contact of SM, Q and T with hair induced the alkylation of side chains of glutamic acid (E*) residues in diverse hard keratins (adduct formation). For analysis hair proteins were subjected to lysis to make them soluble and subsequently to proteolysis with pepsin to generate adducted peptides. Micro liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization high-resolution tandem-mass spectrometry (µLC-ESI MS/HR MS) allowed the detection of the three biomarker peptides AE*IRSDL, FKTIE*EL and LE*TKLQF. The characteristic alkyl-chain hydroxyethylthioethyl (HETE) was attached by SM, hydroxyethylthioethylthioethyl (HETETE) derived from Q and the hydroxyethylthioethyloxyethylthioethyl (HETEOETE)-moiety originated from exposure to T. Accordingly, we herein present an extended and improved forensic method for the biomedical verification of hair exposure to blister agents. Due to the currently growing threat by chemical warfare agents we also included some general toxicological and bioanalytical remarks of SM poisoning helpful not only for physicians and toxicologists.",

    "Abstract": "Tributyltin (TBT) is an environmental contaminant that induces diverse toxic effects in mammals, but the cellular mechanisms underlying adaptation to TBT stress remain poorly understood. Conjugation of ATG8s to single membranes (CASM) is a noncanonical LC3‑lipidation pathway activated by various stressors, distinct from canonical autophagy. We previously showed that TBT reduces lysosomal acidity and inhibits autophagy in SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, we observed TBT-induced LC3-II accumulation, which was reduced by bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub>, and tubular LC3-positive structures as hallmarks of CASM. In this study, we investigated whether TBT activates CASM. TBT (700 nM) induced LC3-II accumulation, which was completely blocked by bafilomycin A<sub>1</sub> in SH-SY5Y and HeLa cells. Unlike autophagy, TBT induced LC3-II accumulation even under class III PI3K inhibition by wortmannin and in FIP200-knockout cells. Salmonella effector protein SopF, which inhibits V-ATPase-ATG16L1 association required for CASM, inhibited TBT-induced LC3-II accumulation. In FIP200-knockout cells, TBT induced LC3 accumulation on lysosomes, the primary CASM target. TBT also promoted nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) in a SopF-sensitive manner. Together, these results identify CASM as a lysosomal stress response to TBT, induced via the V-ATPase-ATG16L1 axis, leading to TFEB activation. This mechanism provides a toxicological framework for understanding xenobiotic-induced lysosomal adaptations.",

    "Abstract": "There is increasing concern that thyroid hormone system-disrupting chemicals (THSDCs) may affect brain development during gestation and lactation. THSDCs comprise a wide range of natural and synthetic xenobiotics that activate diverse biological pathways. However, how disruption of specific molecular targets alters maternal thyroid hormone homeostasis and brain development in the offspring warrants further investigation. To address this question, this study investigates the effects of two THSDCs administered to pregnant rats from gestational day 6 through postnatal day 21: 5-propyl-2-thiouracil (PTU, 2.4 mg/kg/day), inhibitor of thyroid hormone synthesis, and pregnenolone-16α-carbonitrile (PCN, 300 mg/kg/day), inducer of hepatic enzymes involved in thyroid hormone metabolism. Circulating and brain thyroid hormone levels, enzymatic activities, and histopathology were assessed in dams and offspring. To further elucidate underlying mechanisms, multi-omics analyses combining proteomics, metabolomics, and spatial transcriptomics were performed on target organs including the thyroid gland, liver, and brain. Exposure to PTU resulted in severe thyroid hormone depletion in both serum and brain, accompanied by structural brain abnormalities, whereas PCN primarily induced hepatic enzyme activity with minimal effect on circulating thyroid hormone levels. Despite these distinct modes of action, multi-omics integration revealed convergent perturbations across molecular layers in the brain, particularly affecting energy metabolism and cytoskeletal organization with more pronounced effects observed following PTU exposure. Overall, multi-omics profiling enabled robust and highly sensitive identification of molecular signatures reflective of PCN exposure, without significant evidence of associated adverse toxicological effects. This approach highlights the value of multi-omics for mechanistic characterization and predictive assessment of THSDC-induced neurodevelopmental toxicity.",

    "Abstract": "Nanoagrochemicals aim to increase safety and sustainability, representing an alternative to conventional agrochemicals. Given the infancy of this field, the risk-benefit analysis for nano-enabled agrochemicals remains unresolved. New Approach Methodologies (NAMs), such as omics, are high on the agenda to move beyond standard hazards, as the investigation of the mechanisms of toxicity deliver valuable information to understand the risks. NUCOP-M<sup>®</sup>, a Cu-based commercial formulation containing nano-features, was previously assessed in Enchytraeus crypticus (Oligochaeta), impacting survival and reproduction based on the standard OECD Enchytraeid Reproduction Test (28 days) and its extension (56 days). The aim of the present study was to understand the mechanisms of toxicity of NUCOP-M<sup>®</sup> at sublethal concentrations (100 and 500 mg Cu/kg soil of NUCOP-M<sup>®</sup>) in short and longer exposure (2, 21 days) using a high-throughput gene expression microarray (NAMs) containing probles for 44,000 genes (a 4 × 44 K microarray). Results showed high transcriptomic response after 21 days exposure, although after 2 days there was an indication of increase in intracellular transport. At 21 days, the gene expression profile was compatible with effects on embryo development, which could be linked to reproductive effects observed at 28- and 56-days of exposure. Several of the genes found up-regulated points towards mitochondrial stress and activation of mechanisms to cope with oxidative stress. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms of toxicity of nanoagrochemicals in non-target species, filling a significant knowledge gap.",

    "Abstract": "Gentamicin (GEN), an aminoglycoside antibiotic, induces nephrotoxicity primarily via mitochondrial dysfunction. This review summarizes mechanisms including reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) activation. These mitochondrial alterations lead to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, apoptosis, and renal injury. In addition to apoptotic pathways, necrotic cell death can also be triggered, further aggravating kidney damage. Furthermore, GEN has been reported to directly interfere with mitochondrial ribosomes and gene expression, highlighting mitochondria as both targets and amplifiers of cellular toxicity. Therapeutic approaches targeting mitochondrial integrity, including antioxidants and mitochondrial transplantation, demonstrate potential nephroprotection. Additional strategies such as mPTP, stimulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, and pharmacological modulators of mitochondrial respiration have also shown promise in experimental studies. Understanding mitochondrial mechanisms underlying gentamicin-induced renal injury is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies. A more comprehensive knowledge of mitochondrial regulation, organelle crosstalk, and early biomarkers of dysfunction will facilitate translation into clinical practice. Overall, preserving mitochondrial function represents a promising avenue for reducing nephrotoxicity while maintaining the antibacterial efficacy of GEN.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Nowadays, the media make a major contribution to the medical education of the population. However, people who are not experts are hardly able to assess the accuracy of the situations depicted. To test the reliability of the statements made, this paper deals with the analysis of the accuracy of the pharmacological content in the television series Dr. House . The database is currently around 20 years old. The series was first broadcasted in the United States in 2004. The aim of this study was to check the quality of the pharmacological content. In addition, it analyzed the education by the TV series Dr. House in the field of pharmacological knowledge. Ten episodes containing 105 pharmacological items were analyzed. The analysis was illustrated with eleven comparable parameters of the items. This includes, for example, naming the drugs, evaluating the indication, assessing the therapy, and presenting the drug within the scene. In addition, the course of the series was analyzed for the first and eleventh episodes of each season. This resulted in 131 additional pharmacological contents. The study shows a high usage rate of international non-proprietary names (INN). The indications are often correctly stated, and an appropriate therapy is initiated. A particular and quite unusual feature of the series is that drugs are used as diagnostic tools to come to the correct diagnosis. Antibacterial drugs and psychotropic drugs are strongly presented. The analysis also highlights differences in the use of drugs between various genres in which drugs play an important role. Due to the cynical character traits of Dr. House, there were issues of concerns such as lack of patient information and use of dangerous/experimental therapies. There were also several medication errors. The way of drug administration often remained unclear and the mechanism of action was not explained. A comparison of the seasons throughout the series reveals a decline in the quality of naming, explanation, and accuracy of indications and presentation of pharmacological content. The lowest quality is evident in season 6, with a marked improvement in seasons 7 and 8. Despite some concerns regarding ethical issues, the TV series Dr. House makes a valuable contribution to introducing to the public a broad diversity of pharmacological topics.",

    "Abstract": "Sacubitril/valsartan is a combined neprilysin inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker which simultaneously potentiates the beneficial effects of natriuretic peptides while blocking angiotensin II accumulation. Numerous studies suggest that sacubitril/valsartan has better renal protective effects compared to valsartan but the evidence remains inconsistent. This study compared renal and blood pressure (BP)-lowering effects of sacubitril/valsartan versus valsartan in rats with adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD). This model replicates slow progression and structural and functional characteristics of human CKD. Male Wistar rats (n = 24) were divided into four groups and treated for 35 days as follows: group 1 served as control; group 2 received 0.25% adenine; group 3 received adenine plus sacubitril/valsartan; group 4 received adenine plus valsartan. Adenine significantly increased systolic BP. It also significantly increased the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), plasma urea, creatinine, uric acid, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) while reducing creatinine clearance. Additionally, adenine significantly increased inflammatory markers, decreased antioxidant activity, and induced tubular necrosis, dilatation, and interstitial inflammation. Sacubitril/valsartan significantly reduced systolic BP, with greater effects than valsartan. Both treatments reversed adenine-induced alterations in urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, NAG, plasma urea, creatinine, NGAL, and creatinine clearance, with more pronounced improvements in urea, NAG, and creatinine clearance observed with valsartan. Furthermore, both treatments ameliorated inflammatory and antioxidant changes to a comparable extent. Both treatments showed histopathological improvements, but these were more marked with valsartan. To conclude, both sacubitril/valsartan and valsartan effectively mitigated adenine-induced CKD changes, with sacubitril/valsartan producing greater systolic BP reduction and valsartan showing more pronounced renoprotective effects.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating condition. Current treatments fail to provide adequate relief in roughly one-third of individuals, resulting in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine has emerged as a promising intervention for TRD, offering rapid and sustained antidepressant effects. However, benefits often require maintenance dosing, and long-term outcomes remain unclear. This has promoted interest in adjunctive approaches such as ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP), which combines ketamine with structured psychological support. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted via the OVID platform using Embase, Medline, Global Health, and APA PsycInfo. Keyword clusters related to “Ketamine,” “Diagnosis,” and “Psychotherapy” yielded 768 results. Screening followed PRISMA guidelines, resulting in 11 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Results The selected studies clustered into two thematic categories: structured, protocol-based interventions and individualized, experiential approaches. Across all studies, KAP was associated with reductions in depressive symptoms, with some improvements sustained up to six months. However, among the three studies with control groups, no significant differences were found between KAP and control conditions. Methodological heterogeneity—including variability in treatment protocols, outcome measures, and study designs—limits the ability to draw firm conclusions or identify mechanisms driving KAP’s effects. Conclusion KAP shows promise as a treatment for TRD, potentially offering meaningful and sustained symptom relief. However, limited evidence and methodological variability underscore the need for more rigorous research—particularly randomized controlled trials—to better understand its efficacy and mechanisms.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background With the increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children, radiologists frequently encounter incidental findings that may mimic pathology. One such underrecognized finding is T2-weighted hyperintensity in the superior extraconal orbital fat, which is occasionally mistaken for an infiltrative or neoplastic process. Objective Our objective was to characterize the imaging appearance, prevalence, and clinical associations of superior extraconal orbital fat T2 hyperintensity in pediatric MRI. Materials and methods We conducted a retrospective study of 143 pediatric patients (mean age 7.2±5.1 years) who underwent brain MRI with an orbit-specific protocol between 2015 and 2022. Patients were grouped based on the presence or absence of bilateral papilledema and whether imaging was performed under general anesthesia. Clinical data were extracted from the electronic medical records. Three neuroradiologists reviewed images for the presence of a hyperintense signal along the superior extraconal orbital fat. Interobserver agreement was calculated using Fleiss’ kappa. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess associations with age, anesthesia, gender, and magnet strength. Results Symmetric T2-hyperintense bands along the superior extraconal orbital fat were observed in 45.5% of patients. The finding was more common in younger children (4.4±3.9 years vs. 9.6±4.8 years; P &lt;0.001). Multivariate analysis showed a significant negative correlation with age ( P &lt;0.001) and a positive correlation with papilledema ( P =0.012), but no independent association with gender, anesthesia, or magnet strength. The hyperintensity was non-enhancing or only subtly enhancing. Clinical follow-up demonstrated no subsequent orbital or infiltrative pathology in the majority of patients, and most patients without documented follow-up underwent ambulatory MRI for evaluation of strabismus, which showed no evidence of infiltrative or other orbital disease. Conclusion Superior extraconal orbital fat T2 hyperintensity is a relatively common, likely non-pathologic MRI finding in pediatric patients, particularly in younger children, and the apparent association with anesthesia likely reflects age-related confounding. Awareness of this benign appearance may help avoid diagnostic confusion and prevent unnecessary workup or intervention. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Members of the family Alcanivoracaceae are widespread in marine environments, where they play central roles in hydrocarbon degradation and populate plastics-associated microbiomes, with notable enzymatic potential toward ester- and olefin-based polymers. To further investigate their enzymatic potential, we selected 21 candidate enzymes from the α/β-fold hydrolase superfamily, specifically carboxylesterase Family V from genome-sequenced representatives of the genera Alcanivorax, Alloalcanivorax, and Isoalcanivorax. Genes encoding enzymes were cloned and heterologously expressed in E. coli, of which eleven were purified and subjected to substrate specificity analyses including six previously reported and partially characterised carboxylesterases from A. borkumensis SK2, used as benchmarks. All enzymes showed activity against soluble model p-nitrophenyl ester substrates with acyl chain lengths ranging from C2 to C12 and against bis(benzoyloxyethyl) terephthalate (3PET) and polycaprolactone (PCL2). During 3PET hydrolysis, product accumulation followed the order: benzoic acid > > MHET > terephthalic acid. Five enzymes hydrolysed polycaprolactone (PCL14), poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA), and polybutylene adipate (PBA). All five enzymes displayed temperature optima around or below 50 °C and retained high activity at low temperatures (5-20 °C), consistent with adaptation to marine environments. Enzymes also exhibited moderate solvent tolerance, neutral-to-alkaline pH optima, and low thermostability, with melting temperatures (T<sub>m</sub>) between 31 and 48 °C. Overall, enzymes from Alcanivoracaceae exhibited promising potential for synthetic polyesters' biodegradation, especially under low-temperature conditions, suggesting potential application for degrading specific polyester-based plastics with lower molecular weight, and their utility in further enzyme engineering for plastic recycling and upcycling. KEY POINTS: • Members of Alcanivoracaceae are a rich resource of polyester-degrading enzymes. • All selected and analysed Family V esterases exhibited high activities and stabilities at low temperatures and solvent tolerance. • Characterised enzymes were active with a broad range of polyesters.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective To synthesize magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features and their reported diagnostic performance that differentiate benign from malignant soft-tissue tumors in alignment with the 2020 World Health Organization classification. Materials and methods A systematic review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched through July 2024. Eligible studies reported MRI feature frequencies or diagnostic accuracy for common soft-tissue tumor subtypes. Reviews, case reports, duplicates, non-English publications, and studies outside the scope were excluded. Quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2). Results Seventy-six studies met inclusion criteria. In lipomatous tumors, homogeneous fat signal and thin septa supported lipoma, whereas thick or nodular septa and enhancement favored atypical or well-differentiated liposarcoma. Myxofibrosarcoma often demonstrated an infiltrative fascial “tail.” Vascular lesions included angioleiomyoma with a reticular T2 pattern and glomus tumor with marked T2 hyperintensity and avid enhancement. In peripheral nerve sheath tumors, lower apparent diffusion coefficient values and peritumoral edema favored malignancy. Heterogeneity in imaging protocols precluded meta-analysis; results were summarized descriptively by subtype. Conclusion Consolidated MRI patterns—such as septal morphology in lipomatous tumors, the fascial tail in myxofibrosarcoma, characteristic T2 patterns in vascular lesions, and diffusion and edema cues in nerve sheath tumors—support differentiation of benign and malignant entities, enhance reader confidence, and inform biopsy and management. Standardized prospective studies are needed to validate these thresholds and improve generalizability.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Positron emission tomography (PET) with amyloid-binding tracers was shown to have high sensitivity for the detection of both transthyretin (ATTR) and light-chain (AL) cardiac amyloidosis (CA). Recent studies describe prognostic value of imaging biomarkers from bone scintigraphy and 18 F-Florbetapir. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of imaging biomarkers from 18 F-Florbetaben PET, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), and echocardiography imaging for prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in comparison to serum biomarkers in patients with different types of CA. Methods Patients who underwent cardiac 18 F-Florbetaben PET/MRI were prospectively enrolled and received clinical follow-up for up to 36 months and MACE were reported (NCT07154381). Scans were reported by two blinded, nuclear medicine physicians. Imaging biomarkers including average retention index (RI), T1 mapping/ extracellular volume (ECV) and serological markers were estimated and their association with MACE free survival was analyzed. Results Twenty-one patients with confirmed CA were enrolled. MACEs were reported in 14 of 21 patients (66.7%). Higher average RI was the only imaging biomarker that was a significant predictor for MACE in uni- and multivariate analysis (HR = 4.02, 95%CI: 1.25-12.9, p &lt; 0.05). N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was a significant predictor in uni- but not in multivariate analysis. Patients with AL-CA showed a higher rate of MACE than patients with other subtypes. Conclusion Integrated 18 F-Florbetaben PET/MR allows diagnosis, subtype differentiation and outcome predication of CA. The average RI was the only significant and independent prognostic imaging biomarker of MACE. Future prospective studies are warranted to investigate benefits for patient management and risk assessment in larger cohorts.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Combining interventional therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has shown potential benefits in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, comprehensive evidence on its efficacy and safety remains limited. Methods A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science was conducted to identify eligible studies for single-arm and Bayesian network meta-analyses (NMA). Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary endpoint, while overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs) were secondary outcomes (PROSPERO: CRD42024619661). Findings This study included 45 studies (n = 4,738), evaluating 14 distinct regimens. In single-arm analysis, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) plus tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) plus tislelizumab [TACE-TKI-Tisle] yielded a pooled median PFS of 11.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.02–15.37), an ORR of 72% (95% CI 63–80%), and a grade ≥ 3 AE rate of 24% (95% CI 15–34%). NMA showed that TACE-TKI-Tisle and TACE-TKI-Camrelizumab (Camre) achieved significantly longer PFS than TACE-TKI or TACE alone. TACE-TKI-Toripalimab (Tori) showed OS benefits over TACE-TKI-Camre (HR = 0.43; 95% CI 0.20–0.95) and TACE-TKI-Pembrolizumab (Pembro) (HR = 0.32; 95% CI 0.13–0.81). Cumulative ranking via surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) indicated that TACE-TKI-ICI achieved the highest efficacy ranking. TACE-TKI-Tisle and TACE-TKI-Tori ranked highest for PFS/ORR, with TACE-TKI-Tori ranking first for OS (SUCRA = 0.981). While TACE-TKI-ICI combinations were generally associated with more grade ≥ 3 AEs, TACE-TKI-Tisle ranked intermediately for safety (SUCRA = 0.426). Conclusion TACE-TKI-ICI combinations show promising efficacy in HCC. TACE-TKI-Tisle offers balanced efficacy and safety, while TACE-TKI-Tori provides notable OS benefits, warranting further validation in prospective studies.",

    "Abstract": "Radiotherapy (RT), widely employed in clinical practice to suppress tumor progression, exhibits an abscopal effect that enhances immunogenic activity to potentially benefit immunotherapeutic efficacy. However, the tumor types most likely to exhibit such effects remain unclear. Since TP53-wild type tumors are sensitive to RT, we hypothesized and aimed to investigate whether these tumors are prone to RT-induced abscopal effects. Bioinformatic analyses with RNAseq were conducted to identify the differentially expressed genes. Next, quantitative polymerase chain reaction with flow cytometry was used to assess the potential mechanism. In liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC), a cancer type with a 27% TP53 mutation (therefore 73% TP53-wild type), we noticed that p53 expression positively correlated with the 15 selective immunotherapy-associated genes. We consequently validated that the IFNγ-up-regulated genes in TP53-wild type A549 cells were correlated with better immunotherapeutic outcomes. In contrast, RT induced a distinct set of genes enriched in p53 signaling pathways to correlate with better survival in LIHC patients, but not with immunotherapeutic response. Even so, we found that RT specifically induced apoptosis in TP53-wild type HCT116 cells compared to TP53null HCT116 cells to significantly promote immune cell activation in vitro. We consequently demonstrated the major factors, including IFNα and IFNγ expression, induced by RT in TP53-wild type tumors potentially enhance M1 macrophage polarization, whereas these effects were absent in TP53null models. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that RT specifically suppressed TP53-wild type tumors, leading to IFNs expression. The RT-mediated immunogenic activation was potentially derived from the RT-induced IFNs, which were speculated to contribute to M1 macrophage polarization and immunogenic activity. These results suggest TP53-wild type tumors may be ideal candidates for combining RT and immunotherapy in clinical settings.",

    "Abstract": "Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade is the standard therapy for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (RMHNSCC), yet many patients exhibit poor responses. Potential non-invasive biomarkers for predicting treatment response in RMHNSCC remain unclear. In this study, we collected blood samples from 47 RMHNSCC patients and 17 healthy controls. PD-1 expression was evaluated using 10-color flow cytometry before treatment. Subpopulations of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were assessed at baseline, 2-3 weeks, and 6 weeks after the first anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. A total of 116 patient samples were used for longitudinal comparison of treatment-induced changes in lymphocyte subpopulations. Patients had higher PD-1+ PBL levels than healthy individuals (25.0% vs. 20.3%, P = 0.006). Those with PD-1+ PBLs ≥ 25% exhibited elevated T cell levels and higher frequencies of PD-1+lymphocyte subsets expressing CD38 and HLA-DR concurrently or CD56/CD16, alongside reduced NK cell levels before anti-PD1 therapy. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.2 months, with an overall one-year PFS rate of 18%. The patients with PD-1+ PBLs ≥ 25% showed significantly poorer one-year PFS (7% vs. 29%, P = 0.039) and overall survival rates (20% vs. 50%, P = 0.018) than the opposite group. Comparing fold changes from baseline, the patients with PD-1+PBLs ≥ 25% showed significantly lower increases in CD4+CD38+HLA-DR +T cells (median: 1.15 vs. 1.66 at the first post-treatment test), and CD8+CD38 + HLA-DR + T cells (medians: 1.01 vs. 1.34 and 1.23 vs. 1.78 at the first and second post-treatment tests, respectively) compared to the opposing group. Our findings indicate that high PD-1 expression in PBLs predicts poor treatment outcomes for anti-PD-1 ICIs in patients with RMHNSCC. Dynamic immune monitoring can assist physicians in tailoring personalized therapeutic strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Antigen heterogeneity remains a major obstacle to the effective application of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy in solid tumors. We investigated the potential of epitope spreading as a strategy to overcome this limitation and examined whether CAR-T cells concomitantly producing IL-7 and CCL19 (7 × 19 CAR-T cells) could act as potent inducers of epitope spreading, as well as the underlying mechanisms. We used a murine model inoculated with a mixture of cancer cell lines-genetically modified to express the CAR target antigen-and their respective parental lines lacking target expression. Following administration of 7 × 19 CAR-T cells, flow cytometry and peptide stimulation assays were performed to evaluate the induction of tumor antigen-specific T cells and dendritic cells within tumor-draining lymph nodes and tumor tissues. We also evaluated the antitumor efficacy of 7 × 19 CAR-T cells derived from an allogeneic donor and their capacity to induce epitope spreading in vivo and ex vivo. In multiple tumor mixture models, 7 × 19 CAR-T cells demonstrated marked antitumor activity and promoted epitope spreading in murine solid tumor models, enabling endogenous T cells to recognize and target tumor-associated antigens. This response was dependent on cross-presentation by defined dendritic cell subsets in both the tumor microenvironment and tumor-draining lymph nodes within 2 weeks of 7 × 19 CAR-T cell administration. Notably, 7 × 19 CAR-T cells derived from allogeneic donors also induced epitope spreading in tumor-bearing hosts, thereby increasing survival. The 7 × 19 CAR system is a promising strategy for overcoming antigen heterogeneity in solid tumors by promoting epitope spreading.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty (RSA) is widely used to treat shoulder joint pathologies. However, this procedure may result in reduced range of motion (ROM), scapular notching, and prosthetic instability. These complications vary among patients, highlighting the need for individualized preoperative planning. This study introduces a novel parametric methodology to determine optimal glenoid component positioning by evaluating ROM, instability ratio, and the percentage of bone resected. Method The proposed approach was applied to four patient models treated with two prosthetic designs. The methodology consists of four steps within a patient-specific parametric tool: 3D anatomical reconstruction, virtual surgical planning, biomechanical and geometric evaluation, and identification of optimal configurations. Fifteen glenoid component orientations were generated by varying tilt angles. The best configurations were identified based on ROM and instability assessments, while bone resection volume was calculated as an additional parameter. Results Maximum values of abduction–adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation were 87.23°, 90°, and 70.59°, respectively, although not achieved in a single configuration. Instability ratios ranged from 0.23 to 0.62. Bone resection varied between 0.4% and 5.5%, depending on the configuration. Conclusions This methodology provides a patient-specific framework to support preoperative planning in RSA. By combining ROM analysis, instability assessment, and bone preservation, the approach enables the identification of glenoid component orientations that improve mobility while minimizing instability risk and surgical invasiveness.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Stroke represents a major complication in Takayasu arteritis (TA). We aimed to determine clinical characteristics and neurological outcomes in TA patients with stroke compared to those without. We retrospectively analyzed 35 patients (27F/8 M) with documented stroke to 50 consecutive patients (47F/3 M) without stroke followed by the Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty. Demographic data, clinical manifestations, arterial involvement patterns, treatments, and neurological outcomes were evaluated. Disability was assessed using the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Barthel Index, and Modified Rankin Scale. Mean age at diagnosis among patients with stroke and non-stroke was similar (38.5 ± 10.7 vs. 35.6 ± 11.6 years). The mean age at stroke was 43.1 ± 10.3 years. Patients with stroke were more likely to be male (22.9% vs. 6.0%, p = 0.023). Strokes were predominantly ischemic (91.4%), affecting anterior circulation (82.8%) with left hemisphere predominance (72.4%). Internal carotid artery (ICA) involvement was significantly associated with stroke (right ICA: 51.4% vs 18.0%, p = 0.001; left ICA: 37.1% vs 18.0%, p = 0.047), while abdominal aorta involvement seemed to be protective (20.0% vs 42.0%, p = 0.028). Male gender (OR = 5.70, p = 0.038) and any ICA involvement (OR = 5.98, p = 0.004) were identified as independent predictors of stroke. Importantly, 40% experienced stroke as the initial TA manifestation. Among those developing stroke after TA diagnosis, 85.7% were already receiving immunosuppression and 47.6% antiplatelet therapy. Stroke patients demonstrated significant disability (mean EDSS: 3.63 ± 3.36 vs 0.02 ± 0.14, p &lt; 0.001) and 11.4% mortality, median 5 years after stroke. Male patients and those with ICA involvement face the highest risk for stroke in TA. Long-term consequences are devastating with increased mortality, severe disability and high recurrence rates. The failure of immunosuppressive therapy to prevent stroke in the majority of treated patients, combined with substantial perioperative mortality, stress the inadequacy of current management strategies.",

    "Abstract": "CaRCC1-16 confers thermotolerance in pepper by interacting with stress-related proteins, enhancing photosynthetic efficiency, regulating stomatal activity, and modulating the expression of stress-responsive genes. Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is an economically important crop with high medicinal and biopesticidal properties that faces severe yield losses due to abiotic stresses. The regulator of chromosomal condensation 1 (RCC1) family protein is known to play important roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. While several RCC1 members have been functionally characterized in Arabidopsis and other species, their role in pepper remains largely unexplored. In this study, we identified 28 CaRCC1 genes in pepper genome, unevenly distributed across 11 chromosomes. Phylogenetic characterization divided these genes into six groups, with members within each group sharing conserved gene structure and protein motif/domain structure. Promoter analysis revealed a high density of cis-acting elements associated with growth, hormone signaling, and stress responses. Furthermore, transcript profiling ABA and various abiotic stresses (heat, cold, drought, and salinity) revealed differential expression patterns, with CaRCC1-16 showing prominent transcription induction. Subcellular localization confirmed that CaRCC1-16 localized in the nucleus. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis shows the interaction of CaRCC1-16 with ATpase, E2 18 and ETIF3 in the cytoplasm. Functional analyses of CaRCC1-16 demonstrate its role as a positive regulator of thermotolerance in pepper. Overexpression of CaRCC1-16 in pepper enhances heat tolerance by improving photosynthetic efficiency, regulating stomatal activity, reducing lipid peroxidation, and mitigating reactive oxygen species accumulation. In contrast, silencing of CaRCC1-16 results in increased heat sensitivity, overall, these findings elucidate the evolutionary history of the CaRCC1 family and, insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying pepper response to high temperature stress and, more significantly, define a previously unknown and important role for CaRCC1-16 in mediating the heat stress response through a novel protein interaction network. Contributing to our understanding of the biological functions of the RCC1 gene family in plant abiotic stress interaction, provides a foundation for crop improvement strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Pasture systems strongly influence microbiome diversity in both soils and grazing ruminants, and their interactions through interconnected microbial exchange pathways. In temperate regions, grazed pasture systems are predominantly composed of perennial ryegrass-white clover, representing standard systems under contemporary management. However, sustainable alternatives such as regenerative agriculture, which emphasise diverse pasture species, are gaining attention. Diverse pastures, due to their varied root structures and nutritional composition, exert more pronounced effects on soil and ruminant microbiomes than standard swards. This review synthesises current knowledge on soil and ruminant gut microbiome responses to diverse pasture systems. Diverse swards enhance soil organic carbon and microbial abundance, while their varied nutrient profiles and bioactive compounds, together with ingested soil microbes during grazing, contribute to a more diverse and stable gut microbiome, potentially strengthening soil–gut microbial interactions. However, few omics-based studies have explored microbiome responses to pasture management, and none have simultaneously investigated soil and ruminant gut microbiomes under regenerative management. This review highlights these gaps and proposes future research directions, including integrated multi-omics approaches, to advance understanding of soil–gut microbiome dynamics, interactions, and functional roles within pasture-based agroecosystems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Colonic metastasis from breast cancer is extremely rare, with an incidence of only 0.1%. Diagnosis is often difficult and guidelines are not yet established. The aim of our review is investigating the latency from the primary tumor, the common symptoms, the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and the role of surgery for this rare clinical scenario. Materials We report the case of a 57-year-old woman with multiple colonic metastasis from primary breast tumor, who underwent laparoscopic left hemicolectomy. A systematic review of 64 case reports was also conducted. Results Lobular carcinoma is more frequently associated with gastro-intestinal (GI) metastasis than ductal carcinoma. The median age at diagnosis is 65.5 (IQR = 15) years with colonic metastases typically occurring after a median of 8 years (IQR = 13) from the primary tumor diagnosis. The most frequent symptoms are abdominal pain (34.4%), bowel habit changes (26.6%), and intestinal obstruction (9.4%). In 25% of cases, metastases were incidentally discovered during follow-up. The median disease-free survival was 12 months (IQR = 27.5). Thirteen studies reported death at a median of 12 months (IQR = 20), while 24 did not report follow-up data. Conclusions The poor prognosis is mainly due to long latency between primary diagnosis and metastasis onset, as well as to non-specific symptoms. Immuno-histochemical is crucial for diagnosis, although not sufficient to determine tumor origin definitively. Patients with history of breast cancer presenting with GI symptoms should undergo prompt endoscopic evaluation, although routine surveillance remains controversial. Surgery may be considered in selected cases, but systemic therapies remain the cornerstone of treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Early detection and monitoring of neurodegenerative processes in persons with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) is currently a major challenge. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is an emerging method to visualize retinal vascular architecture. However, its use has mainly been investigated in relapsing MS. We evaluated OCTA as a possible complementary method in progressive MS (PMS) in a monocentric, retrospective, cross-sectional study. Eyes with evidence of optic neuritis were excluded from analysis. OCTA images acquired using a Spectralis OCT (Heidelberg Engineering) were analyzed with an established deep learning-based segmentation algorithm. After rigorous quality control, 85 eyes of 62 PwPMS were compared with 64 eyes of 43 age and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). The vessel density in the superficial vascular complex (VD<sub>SVC</sub> (%)) was reduced in PMS compared to HC (p = 0.018). VD<sub>SVC</sub> correlated negatively with age in PwPMS and HC. Using a Johnson-Neyman analysis, we identified that the disease duration influences the VD<sub>SVC</sub> in PMS individuals < 57.5 years of age. PwPMS with disease duration > 10 years had reduced VD<sub>SVC</sub> compared to subjects with ≤ 5 years of disease duration (p = 0.049) (corrected for age). Clinical disability (EDSS) negatively correlated with VD<sub>SVC</sub> in PwPMS (β = -0.487, p = 0.010). These results suggest that OCTA might be suitable to detect retinal vascular changes in PwPMS. One consequence could be structured and harmonized OCTA investigations as part of routine clinical practice. External validation and longitudinal studies are necessary to further elaborate OCTA´s potential in monitoring PwPMS.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Static spirometry parameters may offer practical alternatives to estimate maximum oxygen consumption (V̇O 2max ) in athletic populations. This study evaluated forced vital capacity (FVC) as a predictor of V̇O 2max across different sports, developing prediction equations for field-based assessment. Methods Four hundred twenty-two athletes (324 males, 98 females; age 22.9 ± 8.5 years) from cycling ( n = 123), swimming ( n = 68), triathlon ( n = 60), multisport ( n = 83), and other sports ( n = 88) performed spirometry and maximal incremental testing. V̇O 2max was directly measured using breath-by-breath gas analysis. LASSO regression identified predictors, with Bland–Altman analysis assessing agreement. Results FVC and gender emerged as significant predictors ( R 2 = 0.690, P &lt; 0.001). The equation V̇O 2max (L·min −1 ) = (FVC × 0.61) + (Gender × 0.86) yielded SEE = 0.65 L·min −1 . Including additional variables (Maximum voluntary ventilation, body weight, age) marginally improved prediction ( R 2 = 0.712) but reduced practical utility. Coefficient of variation between measured and predicted values was 12.1%. Sport-specific analysis revealed highest predictive accuracy in swimmers ( R 2 = 0.893). Conclusion FVC provides reasonable population-level V̇O 2max estimates in athletes, though individual predictions require caution given substantial unexplained variance (31%). Sport-specific equations, particularly for swimming populations, enhance predictive accuracy. These findings offer practical screening tools for coaches lacking access to metabolic testing equipment, though direct measurement remains the gold standard for individual assessment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose The rapid heart rate increase during the first seconds of exercise is primarily mediated by cardiac vagal withdrawal, which can be assessed by the 4-s exercise test (4sET), a pharmacologically validated and highly reliable procedure. However, the need for a cycle ergometer limits its applicability. Thus, we aimed to test the validity of a modified 4sET using wheelchair propulsion simulation (WPS) by comparing it with the traditional cycle ergometer protocol. Methods Sixty healthy adults (30 men, 30 women; 22 ± 2 years) performed, in randomized order, three repetitions each of the traditional (LEG 4sET) and modified (WPS) protocols. RR intervals were recorded via electrocardiography, and the cardiac vagal index (CVI) was calculated as the ratio of the last pre-exercise RR interval (RRB) to the shortest exercise RR interval (RRC). Results Mean CVI was lower for WPS compared with LEG (1.42 ± 0.03 vs. 1.48 ± 0.03; P = 0.001). Based on identity plots, a correction equation was derived for WPS values &lt; 1.50: y = 0.7706x + 0.3861 (r 2 = 0.63; P &lt; 0.001). After correction, CVI did not differ between protocols (1.48 ± 0.17 vs. 1.48 ± 0.20; P = 0.854). Furthermore, a high and significant intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was found for the CVI between the protocols (ICC = 0.87; [0.74–0.93]; P &lt; 0.05), and Bland–Altman analysis showed negligible bias and acceptable limits of agreement for the corrected WPS CVI. Conclusion The WPS shows strong agreement with the traditional cycle ergometer 4sET, supporting its validity as a simpler and more accessible method for assessing dynamic cardiac vagal control.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) testing may be used to stratify ovarian carcinoma (OC) patients for PARP inhibitor therapy. In the Netherlands, different NGS-based assays are used to assess genomic instability as a hallmark of HRD. We evaluated the uniformity of HRD testing. Firstly, interlaboratory assessments of 10 tumors were performed in 8 centers. 71 out of the 77 (92%) successful tests were concordant. Results were more consistent in OC with a pathogenic variation (PV) or promoter methylation of a homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene (97%) than in those without (87%). Secondly, concordance between BRCA1 / RAD51C promoter methylation and HRD was assessed in 244 samples without a PV in HRR genes. BRCA1 / RAD51C promoter methylation was present in 38 out of 100 (38%) samples classified as HRD, and absent in all ( n = 144) non-HRD samples ( p &lt; 0.001). Lastly, pathology reports from 765 HRD tests were reviewed to evaluate routine diagnostics. Testing was successful in 695 (91%) cases. HRD detection rates were higher in high-grade serous OC compared to other histological subtypes (49% versus 12%, p &lt; 0.001). The five HRD assays varied significantly in HRD detection rates in high-grade serous OC. The results support the applicability of genomic instability analyses to assess HRD, while also highlighting the need to improve harmonization across different assays when HRD is used for therapeutic decision making.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Medicinal leeches express a broad variety of anticoagulants and other bioactive factors that are involved in the blood feeding process. For most of the anticoagulants, several genes exist that may encode isoforms of the respective proteins, including hirudins and decorsins. Decorsins negatively affect platelet aggregation, whereas hirudins are potent thrombin inhibitors. Both factors belong to the hirudin superfamily that also includes the group of hirudin-like factors, and all hematophagous leeches analyzed so far contain several gene copies that encode representatives of at least two of the three groups of these factors. Members of the hirudin superfamily may contain only one central globular domain, but others may contain two or more copies. Here we describe the molecular identification and partial functional characterization of a broad variety of putative mono-, bi and multimeric hirudins, decorsins and hirudin-like factors in two Asian medicinal leech species, namely Hirudo nipponia and H. tianjinensis . Some of the monomeric hirudins and decorsins have already been described before, but they represent only a small part of the overall diversity. For the first time, putative monomeric and one oligomeric decorsins of H. tianjinensis were expressed as recombinant proteins, functionally characterized and successfully verified as platelet aggregation inhibitors. In addition we have conducted phylogenetic analyses based on genomic and mitochondrial markers and found convincing evidence that H. nipponia and H. tianjinensis together with members of the genus Whitmania form a monophyletic clade that is clearly distinct from clades that are formed either by European members of the genus Hirudo or by members of the genus Hirudinaria .",

    "Abstract": "Abstract R2R3-MYBs constitute one of the largest families of plant transcription factors and several members are involved in the regulation of distinct branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway, acting as activators or repressors of the biosynthesis of a plethora of specialized metabolites. Although R2R3-MYBs have been extensively characterized as regulators of lignin deposition in distinct cellular contexts and species, still little is known about their roles in regulating specific aspects of grass lignification. Here, we report on the genome-wide characterization of the R2R3-MYB family in the model grass Setaria viridis and identification of members potentially involved in the regulation of lignin/tricin metabolism. A total of 132 genes encoding R2R3-MYBs were found in S. viridis , which clustered in 43 well-supported subgroups. Comprehensive in silico expression, co-expression, and RT-qPCR analyses allowed the identification of 4 candidate SvMYB s that showed (i) similar expression profiles to that observed for lignin biosynthetic genes in a set of different organs/conditions of S. viridis ; (ii) similar expression patterns to that of lignin biosynthetic genes along the S. viridis elongating internode; (iii) co-expression with several phenylpropanoid- and lignin-related genes in public transcriptomic databases; (iv) high expression levels in the top of the S. viridis elongating internode, a tissue undergoing active lignification. Three of these SvMYBs activated the promoters of lignin and tricin biosynthetic genes in transactivation assays using tobacco protoplasts. Altogether, our results suggest that these three transcription factors control grass-specific aspects of lignin deposition and further studies might confirm their ability to control lignin deposition and tricin metabolism in S. viridis .",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Most existing genotype-by-environment interaction (G×E) methods assume a known causal direction as an assumption that often does not hold and can lead to biased estimates and spurious findings. To address this, we introduce the Genetic Causality Inference Model (GCIM), a novel approach designed to infer causal directions in G×E studies. GCIM integrates polygenic risk scores (PRS) for both the exposure and the outcome to strengthen causal inference and reduce spurious interaction signals. We evaluated GCIM using simulated data across varying genetic and residual correlation settings and compared its performance to existing PRS-by-environment (PRS×E) models under both null and alternative G×E scenarios. GCIM was also applied to real-world UK Biobank data in both causal directions. GCIM consistently outperformed existing methods by accurately identifying the absence of G×E variance and avoiding false positives, even in the presence of strong phenotypic heteroscedasticity due to residual heterogeneity. Other methods often generated spurious associations, especially under reverse causality. Applying GCIM to UK Biobank data, we investigated 11 circulating biomarkers (including liver enzymes, lipids, and inflammatory markers) and three anthropometric traits (BMI, body fat, and waist-to-hip ratio [WHR]). GCIM identified that bilirubin modulates genetic effects on BMI and WHR, while body fat modulates genetic effects on C-reactive protein, with associations remaining significant after multiple testing corrections. Overall, GCIM provides a more reliable framework for GxE analysis, particularly under challenging conditions such as residual heterogeneity and uncertain causal direction. However, further development is needed to improve its statistical power.",

    "Abstract": "Pulses of plant resources can influence the spatial aggregation and population dynamics of primary consumers, but the extent to which these effects cascade up the food chain to affect secondary consumers remains poorly understood. Mast fruiting events in Southeast Asian dipterocarp forests, for example, are known to impact a wide range of bird and mammal granivores, but it remains unclear whether the predators of these vertebrates are indirectly affected by seed production. Here, we assess bottom-up effects of masting on a suite of primary and secondary consumers in a tropical rainforest in Borneo, using structural equation models to characterize a network of frugivore/granivores and carnivores. The models were parameterized using 10 years of camera trap and seed availability data collected between 2013 and 2024, spanning two major masting events. These models also account for an outbreak of introduced disease (African swine fever) and the reduced abundance of human visitors in the forest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Dipterocarp seed availability was correlated with the intensity of local site use by omnivorous Malay civets (Viverra tangalunga) and bearded pigs (Sus barbatus), but not granivorous murid rodents or pheasants. Leopard cat site use was correlated with murid rodents, but not pheasants. These findings suggest that masting in this ecosystem is associated with site use intensity of some large-bodied primary consumers but not smaller granivores, and therefore did not percolate up the food web to influence the predators of these taxa, in contrast to research from temperate masting systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Tanglegrams are drawings of two rooted binary phylogenetic trees and a matching between their leaf sets. The trees are drawn crossing-free on opposite sides with their leaf sets facing each other on two vertical lines. Instead of minimizing the number of pairwise edge crossings, we consider the problem of minimizing the number of block crossings , that is, two bundles of edges crossing each other locally. With one tree fixed, the leaves of the second tree can be permuted according to its tree structure. We give a complete picture of the algorithmic complexity of minimizing block crossings in one-sided tanglegrams by showing -completeness, 2.25-approximations, and a fixed-parameter algorithm with the parameter being the number of block crossings of the computed tanglegram. We also state results for non-binary trees.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study evaluates the effectiveness of the Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA) in solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and its extension with trucks and drones, the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem (FSTSP). The algorithm was tested on benchmark instances and two real-world scenarios. BRKGA achieved an average gap of 1.4% for TSP and showed better runtime compared to Simulated Annealing (SA) for smaller FSTSP instances. Although it produced faster computational results than SA for medium and large instances, the solution quality was slightly lower. When compared to leading metaheuristics like HTGVNS and HGVNS, BRKGA had competitive runtimes but was less optimal in solutions. In practice, the algorithm reduced delivery times and enabled drones to reach difficult locations. These results suggest that BRKGA is a valuable and effective heuristic for routing problems involving hybrid truck-drone systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Solving practical selection problems frequently involves analyzing imprecise and uncertain input. In the absence of unequivocal measures for ranking options, the decision maker needs to resort to pairwise comparisons and capture preferences using comparative linguistic expressions. If multiple decision-makers are involved, the complexity of analysis grows and consistency of results may become questionable. This paper proposes a group decision-making method that draws from the fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and utilizes the type-2 fuzzy envelope of an extended hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (EHFLTS) to aggregate the preferences of multiple decision-makers. This approach avoids the need for normalization or transformation of the input, thereby reducing information loss. The method’s performance is demonstrated using a notional example of a contractor selection problem. The result (the final ranking of options) is then compared with results generated by means of methods presented in the literature. The proposed approach is a flexible and effective group decision support method that addresses key gaps observed in the existing methods.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose Breaking bad news (BBN) in pediatric oncology is emotionally complex and often poorly supported by training or guidelines. The OKRA-Compass, developed through participatory research, provides practical recommendations aiming to enhance BBN quality in German pediatric oncology settings. This paper aims to track insights into the everyday BBN routine. Methods After 6 weeks implementing the OKRA-Compass in five pediatric oncology clinics, a focus group and written feedback captured user experiences. Using thematic analysis, researchers coded and analyzed data to assess perceived changes. The participatory approach included co-researchers, and findings were linked to the Compass’s Delphi-based theses for deeper insight. Results Applying the OKRA-Compass revealed four key outcomes: (1) Considering BBN as a complex process, (2) addressing the multi-layered needs of BBN receivers, (3) encouraging new paths for shared decision-making, and (4) cultivating awareness of the needs of healthcare professionals. Interdisciplinary use enhanced preparation, communication, and emotional safety while highlighting the need for structured training and institutional anchoring of BBN practices. Conclusion The OKRA-Compass supports high-quality, individualized BBN by structuring communication, fostering emotional attunement, and promoting shared decision-making. It enhances interdisciplinary collaboration and self-reflection among healthcare providers. Findings highlight its practical relevance, though broader evaluation is needed. The tool offers a promising framework for improving communication culture in pediatric oncology. This process demands a readiness to adapt, allocate resources, and invest in enhancing team communication skills.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Acinetobacter baumannii ( A. baumannii ) is a Gram-negative bacterium that creates an increasing burden on the healthcare system due to its ability to develop multidrug resistance. Sensitive, rapid and on-site detection of A. baumannii , which has been declared a critical priority pathogen by the World Health Organization, is of great importance. Today, secretory proteins of pathogenic organisms attract attention not only for their role in invasive processes but also as targets for early diagnosis. In this context, SPSFQ, a recently identified secretory protease, is a valuable target for the detection of A. baumannii at very low initial levels, before significant colonization occurs. In this study, ssDNA aptamers for SPSFQ were selected for the first time using the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) method. The two aptamer sequences identified through SELEX were named Apt1 and Apt2, with Kd values of 42.10 ± 6.7 nM and 26.98 ± 1.35 nM, respectively. An ultrasensitive EIS-based biosensor was developed using Apt2, achieving a detection limit of 5.44 fg/mL and a linear range of 1.0–10,000 fg/mL. The aptasensor exhibited good repeatability (RSD: 2.62%) and reproducibility (RSD: 6.62%), and also maintained satisfactory stability during storage. Furthermore, the developed biosensor demonstrated reliable and remarkable performance in real commercial human serum samples, with recovery values of 110.84% and 104.40% for serum samples spiked with 250 and 6500 fg/mL SPSFQ, respectively.

    "Abstract": "An aptamer-gated metal-organic framework-based biosensing platform for highly sensitive detection of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) has been developed. This biosensing platform utilizes aptamers as specific \"gated\" switches, which are integrated with the UiO-66-NH₂ MOFs to construct a \"gated\" sensing system loaded with 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The entry of target bacteria induces specific dissociation of sDNA/Apt, forming an aptamer-bacteria complex on the UiO-66-NH₂ surface while releasing TMB into the solution. Subsequently, the PCN-224-Mn nanozyme catalyzes the oxidation of TMB, generating a colorimetric signal. This biosensing platform demonstrates a broad linear range for detecting New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 Klebsiella pneumoniae (NDM-1 KP) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB), achieving ultra-high sensitivity with detection limits of 5 CFU/mL and 7 CFU/mL, respectively. The practical performance of this biosensing platform was evaluated through spiked recovery experiments. Its excellent recovery demonstrates that the method maintains high reliability and stability even when applied to complex real-world samples, providing an effective technical solution for addressing challenges in microbial detection in practical scenarios.",

Tryptophan (Trp) metabolites formed through the kynurenine (KYN) pathway are known to contribute to kidney failure (KF) complications, some of which may affect the survival of neurons. The aim of this study was to investigate the removal of Trp and its metabolites, KYN, kynurenic acid (KYNA) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-OHKYN) in patients treated by HD or HDF and the impact of patients' comorbidities on toxins removal. The study was conducted in 50 patients with KF. Serum level of free fractions of Trp and its metabolites were measured before and after a dialysis session through high performance liquid chromatography. The serum concentration of Trp, as well as 3-OHKYN/KYN ratio remained unchanged, whereas the concentration of KYN, KYNA, 3-OHKYN, together with KYN/Trp ratio significantly decreased after dialysis procedures. The indices KYNA/KYN and KYNA/3-OHKYN increased. In patients with heart failure, higher reduction ratio (RR) of KYN was found, whereas in patients with diabetes higher KYN RR and lower KYNA RR was observed. In patients without residual kidney function, KYNA RR was significantly higher compared to patients with preserved diuresis. RR of all tested metabolites did not differ between HD and HDF treated patients. In KF, Trp metabolites were removed from the blood during dialysis procedures with different efficacies. Targeted strategies to lower KYN pathway metabolites concentration may be beneficial in patients with KF and selected comorbidities.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Depending on the degree of disability, simple tasks of daily living can be challenging for people with physical disabilities, such as picking up and placing objects, eating, or reaching for a cup to drink independently. Pervasive technologies such as robotic arms can be used to assist with these daily tasks, allowing patients to regain independence while reducing the need for care. Specialized devices, such as assistive forks or spoons, can facilitate these tasks. Image datasets of everyday objects such as MS COCO do not contain assistive devices, which tend to look different from their non-assistive counterparts. We present the dataset WLRI-AD (Work-Life Robotics Institute–Assistive Devices) to enable a robot to interact with devices in assisted living homes. The benefits of including assistive devices are demonstrated by comparing versions of the dataset with each other and to a baseline. Initial results show an improvement in the detection of assistive devices by training a YOLOv8 model on the assistive devices.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Youth sport engagement brings substantial physical, mental, and social benefits, therefore establishing interventions which increase this are of profound importance. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of playing a virtual reality (VR) sports-game and a sports videogame on adolescents’ intentions and perceived skill requirement (PSR) towards the respective sport of each game. Across three sport-specific designs (baseball, golf, tennis), 54 adolescents (aged 13–15) were randomly assigned to play a 20-min VR sports-game, a traditional sports videogame, or a non-sport VR control game. Intentions and PSR towards the sport depicted in each game were measured via questionnaires at baseline, post-test, and four-month retention. Linear mixed models revealed that intentions towards baseball and tennis were significantly improved after playing the VR game, with this effect maintained at retention for tennis. Intentions towards golf were significantly improved after playing the videogame but were not maintained at retention. Neither the VR nor videogame influenced adolescents’ PSR towards the respective sports. We discuss how the sport-specific differences found suggest that the effectiveness of each digital intervention may depend on how well the sport’s features align with the strengths of the technology. Overall, despite limited effects on PSR, the results underscore the pedagogical value of integrating VR and videogame interventions into physical education settings.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is a chronic, inflammatory, immune-mediated disease characterized by inflammation of the axial skeleton, peripheral joints, and entheses. Patients with axSpA often experience a long diagnostic delay, and if left untreated, axSpA can lead to a substantial disease burden and permanent disability. In the US, axSpA is more commonly reported in White individuals than non-White individuals because of its strong association with the HLA-B27 allele, which is more common in White populations and certain Native American tribes. Underrecognition of the disease in non-White patient groups may contribute to underreporting of prevalence, diagnostic delay, undertreatment, and unnecessary disease burden in these patient populations. The goal of this review is to increase awareness and educate healthcare professionals on axSpA in non-White patients by reviewing epidemiology, diagnostic delay, genetic aspects, disease presentation, and treatment disparities among non-White patient populations in the US to promote timely recognition and treatment of axSpA in these patients.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Biomethane represents an interesting solution for the growing pool of energy-intensive companies that are reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. Biomethane may help in the transition from fossil natural gas. Nonetheless, its inclusion in decarbonisation strategies is hindered by uncertainties around its future availability, price, and net environmental impact. This study aims to assess how these uncertainties affect the potential role of biomethane in the energy transition, investigating the specific case of Torino Airport. To explore the dynamics related to the use of biomethane, an energy system optimisation model is employed, to simulate cost-optimal development pathways under alternative prices and emission factors scenario. The results show that the potential availability of biomethane at an affordable price would significantly accelerate the energy transition of the airport. In particular, biomethane is key for strategies based on fuel cells, smoothing the transition from natural gas to an hydrogen supplied system. Nevertheless, price uncertainties still remain, for mid-terms projections, and these were found to significantly affect the operational expenditures, while the potential unavailability of the supplies could significantly jeopardise the airport environmental commitments. In this regard, pathways relying on a combination of different measures, such as electrification, proved to be more resilient to future potential discontinuities in green energy supplies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study examines the environmental and social implications of replacing diesel buses with battery-electric buses in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, through a clearly defined research question and an analytical framework grounded in emission-accounting methodology and social impact indicators. Environmentally, the avoided emissions were estimated using GHG Protocol-based factors and include uncertainty ranges to account for variability in fuel composition, electricity-grid intensity, and annual fleet mileage. The results indicate that full electrification of the municipal fleet could avoid 125,414 t of CO 2 emissions per year, with sensitivity analysis showing a ± 10% variation depending on operational and energy-mix assumptions. Additionally, 7.8 t of CH 4 and 7.4 t of N 2 O emissions could be avoided annually. Social impacts are assessed using secondary indicators related to air quality exposure, noise reduction, accessibility, and mobility equity, highlighting measurable co-benefits for public health and urban inclusion. By integrating environmental and social dimensions, the study contributes empirical evidence to ongoing debates on sustainable urban transport transitions in metropolitan contexts.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Navigation in constrained waters is a cognitively challenging task for seafarers requiring the combined assessment of various elements to perform it with safety. This paper presents our approach to make sense of the dynamic, uncertain, and complex work domain of sea pilotage. We aimed to obtain a detailed description of the overtaking manoeuvre and to understand the cognitive processes of mariners when they perform this task in confined waters. To achieve this, we performed a qualitative study using Applied Cognitive Task Analysis with five highly experienced sea pilots in northern Germany. Based on the content analysis of the interviews and the other data collection activities, we have identified six phases of the overtaking task and twelve high level cognitive challenges that significantly affect pilots’ decision making and situation awareness during overtaking. The main output is a Cognitive Demands Table where the findings on the cognitive challenges, common errors, strategies, and cues are organized. The analysis of our results captured pilots’ insights on decision-making and expertise, the role of communication, planning and foresight and how the cognitive challenges correspond to situation awareness. Finally, practical implications for the design of the workplace and operating procedures, the training of pilots and the limitations of the study are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Climate change and development are having a profound influence on the integrity of coastal Bangladesh’s people, economy and ecology with climate change widely considered the dominant driver. Our bespoke integrated assessment model (IAM) simulates these changes for rural areas by coupling physical models with economic models, considering shocks like cyclone landfalls, and utilising substantial primary/secondary datasets and stakeholder-derived future scenarios. As such, this study assesses the Bangladesh coastal system’s sensitivity to climate change and policy decisions to 2050. The IAM results suggest that flooding and salinisation have high sensitivity to climatic and environmental drivers, and agricultural productivity is strongly dependent on farming methods and investment in better crop varieties to counteract these changes. Inequality, poverty and GDP per capita are more sensitive to non-climatic drivers. Nonetheless, extreme climatic conditions do impact livelihoods due to economic damage with variable effects across different household types. At least over the next 25 years, development choices (i.e. concrete adaptation actions) will have a similar if not stronger influence on livelihoods and economic wellbeing in rural coastal Bangladesh than climate-driven environmental change. This IAM approach supports decision makers to identify sustainable development pathways that address both current socio-environmental vulnerability as well as develop a more climate-resilient future.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Flood and coastal risk management policy in England increasingly promotes coastal adaptation plans that are co-developed by local communities. Using the village of Happisburgh as a case study, this paper adopts an environmental justice lens to explore local resident and policymaker perspectives of managed realignment that may have a bearing on the implementation of community adaptation plans. Perspectives are elicited through a household survey and semi-structured interviews with Happisburgh residents, alongside neighbouring Bacton and Walcott residents. Presented alongside maps of recent geomorphological change, thematic analysis of survey and interview data reveals managed realignment is disputed by local residents where it threatens the integrity and identity of Happisburgh, and if unaccompanied with sufficient practical and financial support. Impacts on community wellbeing, differences of opinion on the practicalities of rollback, and distrust in past community consultations present significant obstacles to community engagement in adaptation at Happisburgh. The insights on financial, practical and wellbeing dimensions to coastal change provide learning on how at-risk coastal communities can be supported in adapting to erosion, but also in a manner that is perceived as just by the communities themselves. Overall, this paper demonstrates that incorporating justice principles into coastal adaptation planning is fundamental for successful community engagement, both to overcome historic environmental justice issues and to facilitate community willingness to adapt to future coastal and climate change.",

In contrast, the terminology surrounding advanced gastric cancer remains inconsistent across regions. In Western oncology, “advanced cancer” often denotes unresectable or metastatic disease, whereas “early-stage cancer” may include resectable stage II–III tumors. This semantic discrepancy has led to confusion in international communication, clinical trials, and guideline interpretation. We propose a three-tier terminology— early gastric cancer , locally advanced gastric cancer , and advanced gastric cancer —to align the Japanese pathological concept with global clinical staging practice and therapeutic intent.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Rising patient volumes, the increasing use of computed tomography (CT) imaging in emergency departments and the resulting prolonged waiting times highlight the urgent need for efficient and accurate diagnostic tools, especially given that the number of experienced healthcare professionals is not increasing at the same pace. Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a promising tool to support fracture detection on CT scans, with the potential to streamline diagnostic workflows in emergency care. However, concerns exist regarding dataset bias, limited external testing, and methodological variability. This systematic review and diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively assess the diagnostic accuracy of AI-driven fracture detection solutions, with a particular focus on the effect of the testing strategy, cohort composition and commercial availability on diagnostic accuracy. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of DTA and reported according to PRISMA-DTA guidelines were followed. We systematically searched Embase, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for studies published from January 2010 onward, complemented by citation chasing and manual searches for commercial AI fracture detection solutions (CAAI-FDS). Two reviewers independently conducted study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment using a modified QUADAS-2 tool. Statistical analysis was conducted using STATA 18.1 and the –metadta– command. Primary analyses evaluated diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) of stand-alone AI based on (1) cohort type (selected vs. unselected), (2) test dataset origin (internal vs. external), and (3) level of analysis (patient-wise, vertebra-wise, rib-wise). Secondary analyses explored accuracy differences according to (1) CAAI-FDS, (2) anatomical region and (3) reader type (stand-alone AI, human unaided, human aided by AI). Forest plots visualized results, and heterogeneity was measured using generalized I 2 statistics. Out of 7683 identified articles, 44 studies were included for meta-analysis. 14 CAAI-FDS were identified. Primary analyses of stand-alone AI showed moderate sensitivity (0.85, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.90) and good specificity (0.92, 95% CI: 0.87, 0.95) in unselected patient cohorts, whereas selected cohorts achieved slightly higher sensitivity (0.89, 95% CI: 0.80, 0.94). Diagnostic accuracy was higher when studies used internal test datasets (sensitivity 0.94, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.97; specificity 0.91, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.94) compared to external test datasets (sensitivity 0.85, 95% CI: 0,77, 0.91; specificity 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89, 0.95). Vertebra- and rib-wise analyses achieved higher specificity (0.98) compared to patient-wise analysis (0.92, 95% CI: 0.89, 0.95), although sensitivity remained moderate across all levels (0.85–0.89). Secondary analyses showed variability among CAAI-FDS (sensitivities 0.68–0.80; specificities 0.87–0.97) and by anatomical region, with the highest sensitivity for skull (0.90, 95% CI: 0.85, 0.93), rib (0.92, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.96) and pelvis fractures (1.00), and lowest for spine fractures (0.82, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.88). Stand-alone AI showed moderate to good diagnostic accuracy, slightly outperforming unaided human readers, with minimal further improvement when humans were aided by AI. While AI demonstrates promising diagnostic accuracy in fracture detection, study biases, stringent patient selection, and lack of external testing raise concerns about real-world applicability. Commercially available solutions tend to underperform compared to pooled study results, highlighting the gap between research settings and clinical practice. Future efforts should focus on reducing bias, improving generalizability and robustness, as well as conducting prospective trials to assess AI’s true impact on clinical outcomes. Graphical abstract",

Analytic morphomics (AM) through enabling measurement of specific biological markers of body composition from medical images is emerging as a potential tool to predict patient outcomes across multiple medical and surgical disciplines. We sought to provide a comprehensive review of the utility of AM in predicting outcomes in trauma patients. A systematic review with a narrative synthesis was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and checklists. PubMed, Embase, Scopus, The Cochrane Library as well as Web of Science and Trip database were searched for studies that assessed the relationship between computed tomography-based AM parameters and clinical outcomes in patients from a trauma cohort. Multiple AM domains, including lumbar muscle quantity and quality, adiposity, craniofacial measurements, and opportunistic bone mineral density (BMD), were consistently associated with adverse outcomes including mortality, length of stay, complications, and functional recovery. CT-derived AM metrics provide valuable prognostic information in trauma populations, extending beyond conventional measures such as chronological age and injury severity scores.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Root-knot nematodes (RKNs), Meloidogyne spp ., exhibit a broad host range, threatening more than 3000 species of plants, including agriculturally important crops such as cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum ), tomato ( Lycopersicon esculentum ) and rice ( Oryza sativa ). Among the over 90 RKN species, the four most prevalent are M. incognita , M. arenaria , M. javanica , and M. hapla , with M. incognita being the most damaging. This paper reviewed the current RKN management strategies, including chemical nematicides, biological control, crop rotation, and resistant varieties, with a focus on the application of the revolutionary CRISPR/Cas genome editing tool in developing RKN resistance in plants. CRISPR/Cas has been widely utilized for improving crop traits due to its specificity, streamline, and inheritability. Recent progress has demonstrated the simplicity and robustness of CRISPR/Cas technology in improving plant traits. Among these, the development of nematode resistance by CRISPR/Cas knocking out of plant compatibility factors in model and commercial plants, has achieved significant progress. This review summarizes the RKN parasitism mechanisms and plant compatibility factors that would be promising CRISPR/Cas targets. The fundamentals and key aspects of CRISPR/Cas genome editing technology are addressed and discussed, and an example experimental pipeline for developing nematode resistance in cotton is described.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In patients with large vestibular schwannomas (VS), surgery is the primary treatment despite risks such as facial nerve dysfunction. Intra-operative monitoring with transcranial motor evoked potentials (TcMEP) helps predict facial nerve outcome but may lead to subtotal resections and later recurrence. This study compares TcMEP thresholds, facial nerve outcome, recurrence rate and progression-free survival in Koos grade 4 vestibular schwannomas. Fifty-five surgically treated patients with Koos grade 4 VS (2015–2024) were included in this retrospective study. All underwent facial nerve TcMEP monitoring. House-Brackmann (HB) scores were assessed postoperatively, and at 6 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. Progression-free survival was analyzed with Kaplan–Meier curves. Postoperatively, 58% showed a decline in facial nerve function. After one year, 83% had good function (HB I–II). A TcMEP threshold increase &lt; 20 mA correlated with good outcomes. In 84% (47/55), a small residual tumor remained (mean 0.4 cc; range 0–7.9 cc). Median growth-free survival was 76 months after subtotal resection (STR) and not reached after near-total resection (NTR). We conclude that TcMEP-guided surgery for large vestibular schwannomas provides good facial nerve outcomes, small acceptable remnants and a low long-term recurrence risk. As fewer than half of residual tumors show growth within 8 years, routine postoperative radiotherapy is not recommended; a watchful-waiting strategy is preferred.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Bevacizumab, originally developed by Genentech under the brand name Avastin ® as an anti-cancer drug, has gained widespread off-label use in ophthalmology due to its similar mechanism of action to other anti-VEGF treatments and its significantly lower cost compared to available on label alternatives for ophthalmological indications. While off-label bevacizumab has been standard in clinical practice for over a decade, recently, a repurposed formulation (brand name: Lytenava ® , Outlook Therapeutics Ltd), developed specifically for vascular retinal conditions, received marketing approval from the European Medicines Agency. This raises questions about what the price for a repurposed formulation should reasonably be, reflecting the efforts to obtain regulatory approval. This paper examines potential cost-based-plus pricing for such a repurposed formulation of bevacizumab using a novel pricing framework across four scenarios. By evaluating the pricing structure through an analysis of critical cost components, including, among others, research and development expenditures, manufacturing costs, and cost-of-capital, the study proposes a price range of €73 to €177 per injection. The explicit breakdown of these cost components provides valuable insights into the economic structure of repurposed biosimilars like bevacizumab, emphasizing how a cost-based-plus pricing model can support more transparent and informed negotiations between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare payers. Ultimately, this approach contributes to the development of pricing strategies that balance affordability for healthcare systems with sustainable returns for manufacturers while fostering the broader development of repurposed treatments. The findings of this paper aim to advance the dialogue on equitable pricing for repurposed therapies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This work addresses the problem of blockchain-based contract signing. We introduce the notion of a protocol step, which is a key concept that facilitates uniform and fair comparisons among existing protocols (especially in light of a claim regarding the minimal step count of a previous proposal that is not substantiated upon closer analysis). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all prior protocols with respect to both mandatory and optional security requirements. On the basis of this analysis, we propose a novel contract signing protocol that, under optimistic execution, does not invoke any on-chain functions and requires only three protocol steps to be completed, thus identifying it as the most efficient solution. A security analysis is presented, thus demonstrating that the proposed protocol satisfies all the mandatory security requirements. We also discuss how the generated signatures and evidence can be aligned with legal and regulatory frameworks. These results confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.",

    "Abstract": "Aplastic anaemia (AA) is a disease that shows complex pathogenesis involving multiple immune factors. While immunosuppressive therapies such as cyclosporine can effectively control AA, they may be ineffective in certain patients or those with relapse. Therefore, new treatments are needed. Among the targets for these treatments, the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway regulates inflammatory cytokines and immune activation. Ruxolitinib, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, reduces T-cell activation and the associated inflammatory response and improves AA disease status in mice. However, its mechanism of action is unclear; thus, further research is needed before its clinical use. We previously showed increased pyroptosis in patients with severe AA (SAA) and that macrophage pyroptosis is an important factor in immune activation. The current study investigated the interaction of ruxolitinib with macrophages and whether the drug could treat SAA by improving pyroptosis levels. We induced differentiation of the THP-1 human monocyte cell line into macrophages in vitro and then induced pyroptosis. After constructing a macrophage pyroptosis model, treatment with different concentrations of ruxolitinib was administered. The results showed that ruxolitinib reduced the levels of pyroptosis and inflammatory-related factors. We then used the SAA mouse model to validate this conclusion. In conclusion, ruxolitinib may affect SAA by reducing the level of macrophage pyroptosis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Although prior research has established sex and menopausal status-based differences in immune response, susceptibility, and severity to a variety of pathogens, their relevance in early Lyme disease is understudied. We examined the clinical and serologic presentation of patients with early Lyme disease, stratified first by sex then by menopausal status. We also explored the hypothesis that males would present with more severe early Lyme disease. In this prospective cohort study from the Mid-Atlantic US, 243 adult, antibiotic-naïve patients were enrolled with a diagnostic erythema migrans rash present. Demographic, physical exam, symptom, laboratory, and two-tier serology data were collected at a baseline, and a post-treatment visit 3 weeks later. Lyme disease severity was operationalized through six indicators: rash size, number of acute symptoms, dermatologic dissemination, positive serology, liver function elevation, and elevated neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. Unadjusted group comparisons and multivariate regression adjusting for potential confounders were used to assess difference. In logistic models adjusted for age, Lyme disease duration, systemic steroid use, and co-morbid thyroid disease, males had higher odds of testing two-tier positive (OR = 1.77 [1.03, 3.04], p = 0.039). This difference was more pronounced between males and pre-menopausal females (OR = 2.93 [1.26–6.79], p = 0.012) and no significant difference was found comparing males to post-menopausal females. In ordinal logistic models with Lyme disease severity as the outcome adjusted for age and Lyme disease duration, males had higher odds of being in a higher disease severity score category (OR = 1.94 [1.20,3.15], p = 0.028); again, particularly in comparison to pre-menopausal females (OR = 2.26 [1.13,4.58], p = 0.044). Heart palpitations ( p = 0.023), vomiting ( p = 0.007), and photophobia ( p = 0.057) trended towards higher reporting among females, while sleep difficulty ( p = 0.010) was higher among males. No differences were found on non-dermatologic components of the physical exam. We found sex and menopausal status to be relevant in accounting for variability in two-tier serologic status and severity of early Lyme disease in a well-characterized group of patients. Lower rates of seroreactivity among females is unexpected but may be consistent with lower acute severity of disease. Our clinical findings underscore the need for additional research to understand possible contributing biologic and/or social behavioral factors, as well as their impact on timely diagnosis and post-treatment conditions.",

    "Abstract": "The pathological process of rheumatoid arthritis is not only driven by immune inflammation but is more profoundly shaped by abnormal remodeling of the extracellular matrix. This study systematically reviews the core manifestations of abnormal extracellular matrix remodeling in RA: matrix sclerosis, excessive degradation mediated by matrix metalloproteinase/a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs, and degradation fragments as damage-associated molecular patterns activating the TLR4/RAGE pathway, thereby forming a self-perpetuating vicious cycle of \"sclerosis-degradation-inflammation amplification-resclerosis,\" significantly exacerbating inflammatory reactions and joint damage. It proposes a dual framework of \"mechanism loop-clinical loop,\" emphasizing the integration of the biomarkers C1M, C3M, COMP, HA, and other ECM-degradation fragments for dynamic disease monitoring, progression prediction, and precise efficacy evaluation. By combining biomarker panels with imaging data, it is expected to optimize the stratification of high-risk populations and individualized treatment adjustments, which may enhance the precision of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and provide a new direction for RA to progress from inflammation control to structural protection.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Alien herbivores can have various deleterious impacts on plant communities, especially on oceanic islands where the flora tends to be dominated by endemic species. The European rabbit ( Oryctolagus cuniculus L.), a polyphagous herbivore, alters plant communities through overgrazing in the areas it has invaded. In Teide National Park, a protected natural area on Tenerife (Canary Islands), rabbit herbivory is one of the main threats to the conservation of its wild flora. A microhistological study of rabbit pellets was carried out, identifying plant tissues based on cellular parameters to characterize its diet for a year in the National Park. A total of 12 plant species, mostly Canary endemics, were detected in the rabbit pellets. Despite this diversity, the diet mainly consists of three plant species: Spartocytisus supranubius , Pterocephalus lasiospermus and Descurainia bourgeauana , respectively. The latter two plant species represent a larger proportion of the diet than their coverage would suggest, potentially indicating selective foraging. This study clarifies the diet and food preferences in Teide National Park. It reveals that these rabbits consume plants previously thought to be too unpalatable, like P. lasiospermus or Adenocarpus viscosus . The data confirm the detrimental impact of rabbits on the flora of the Park and support the need to reduce the populations of this invasive herbivore, to mitigate the damage it causes. Furthermore, these results will surely contribute to designing management plans as precisely as possible, to re-establish potential plant communities and conserve existing diversity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Green disclosure policies aim to improve the transparency of corporate environmental practices and guide investors’ capital allocation. While existing studies mostly examine firm-level effects, their market-level implications in multi-agent systems remain insufficiently explored. This paper develops a dual-market dynamic ESG fund model, integrating agent-based simulation with empirical game-theoretic analysis, to study how upgrade costs, investor valuation preferences, and disclosure regimes jointly shape firms’ green transition incentives in the EU and China. The results show that both transition costs and valuation gaps strongly influence strategic upgrading behaviour and equilibrium outcomes: Strict disclosure sharpens differentiation but may suppress upgrading due to high costs; lax disclosure facilitates initial transitions by polluting firms; and hybrid disclosure, combining lax and strict phases, generates stronger incentives across different firm types. Cross-market comparison further indicates that the EU’s mature regulatory environment is better suited to strict disclosure, whereas China’s emerging market benefits more from a lax form to accelerate early-stage transitions. This study provides a reference for regulators in selecting appropriate disclosure forms at different levels of market maturity and offers methodological support for the sustainable development of green finance markets.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In recent years, object detection has become a cornerstone of many computer vision applications, relying heavily on the availability of high-quality annotated datasets. However, even widely used benchmarks often suffer from annotation issues such as inaccurate bounding boxes, misclassified objects, and missing labels. These annotation errors, especially localization errors, can greatly affect the training and evaluation of detection models. In this survey, we provide a data-centric and comprehensive review of existing methods for identifying and analyzing errors in object detection datasets. We examine the main components of error detection workflows, including annotation error taxonomies and model-agnostic detection techniques. In addition, we develop a standardized categorization of annotation error types specific to object detection, providing a foundation for consistent analysis and comparison across studies. We also perform manual inspections of selected benchmark datasets to observe and quantify common annotation errors in practice. Moreover, the survey highlights the datasets used for evaluating error detection methods and compares their scope and inherent challenges. Finally, we summarize the types of annotation errors found in existing benchmarks and provide recommendations for future research to enhance dataset quality and reliability in object detection.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper investigates the impact of climate risk on the stability of the European financial system, with a particular focus on both transition and physical risk dimensions. Given the long-term and uncertain nature of climate-related risks, traditional econometric methods often fall short in capturing their systemic implications. To address this challenge, we develop a scenario-based framework grounded in realistic projections consistent to the theoretical framework of the Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), encompassing three climate pathways: orderly transition, disorderly transition, and hot house world. We model the relationship between climate risk drivers, European companies, and the financial system using vine copulas, enabling a flexible representation of complex dependencies. The effects of these scenarios on financial institutions are evaluated through key risk metrics (expected return, value at risk, and expected shortfall) conditioned on each climate scenario. Our results offer insights into how climate transition risks propagate through the financial system, with practical implications for financial stability assessment and systemic risk management. The primary contribution lies in integrating both transition and physical climate risks into a coherent and tractable risk assessment framework, offering valuable tools for policymakers, regulators, and financial practitioners. Results show a significant dependence of European financial system to brown companies and, thus, sizable losses in the disorderly transition scenario.",

Batch experiments were conducted under mesophilic conditions using different substrate-to-inoculum (S/I) ratios (0, 1, 2, and 4 g VS-S/g VS-I) and magnetite concentrations (50, 100, 200, 400, and 600 mg L⁻ 1 ). The highest biogas and biomethane production was obtained in the S/I = 1 gVS-S/gVS-I, 2:1 (CM: MOSW) reactor and were 2910.5 ± 199.4 mL CH 4 /gVS and 1718.03 ± 117.73 mL CH 4 /gVS, respectively. At different magnetite concentrations, the highest biogas and biomethane production occurred at 200 mgL −1 magnetite loading rate, 1842.7 ± 112.0 mL CH 4 /gVS and 1081.99 ± 65.78 mL CH 4 /gVS, respectively. The highest total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations were determined at S/I = 4, 2:1 (CM: MOSW) gVS-S/gVS-I loading ratio, while the highest TS and VS removal efficiency was determined at S/I = 1 gVS-S/gVS-I, 2:1 (CM: MOSW) ratio and 100 mgL −1 magnetite loading ratio. When the microbial distribution was examined, the first five dominant species ( W5, S1, Coprothermobacter, Treponema and Fervidobacterium ) did not change after the addition of magnetite. The findings demonstrate the positive effects of magnetite addition on biogas and biomethane production, providing significant insights for the development of new strategies to enhance anaerobic digestion processes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Bile salts are conjugated steroids with digestive functions in vertebrates that reach the ecosystem upon excretion. Their environmental degradation by bacteria resembles the steroid nucleus catabolism that uses the 9,10- seco pathway, although there are two variants depending on whether the hydroxyl group at C-7 is eliminated (variant Δ 4,6 ) or not (variant Δ 1,4 ). Caenibius tardaugens , formerly known as Novosphingobium tardaugens , is a steroid-degrading bacterium used as a model to study the genetic and metabolic traits of steroidal sex-hormones catabolism. In this work, we investigated the bacterium ability to grow on bile salts such as cholate and deoxycholate and we performed directed mutagenesis along with transcriptomic analysis to shed light on the genes involved in bile salt metabolism. The mutation of the igr -like operon ( EGO55_03105-EGO55_03125 ), similar to the cholesterol-degrading operon igr from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, did not affect the ability to grow on bile salts. The transcriptomic analysis in the presence of cholate showed the induction of two gene clusters named bsd I (bile-salts degradation) ( EGO55_16295 to EGO55_16335 ) and bsd II ( EGO55_11460–EGO55_11480 ), containing genes that, according to their sequence identity to other bile salt-degrading bacteria, might participate in the side chain degradation and the HIP pathway of cholate catabolism, respectively. Moreover, the presence of other proteins homologous to the 7α-hydroxy steroid dehydratase Hsh2, such as EGO55_02245, EGO55_12965, or EGO55_06935 , indicates that C. tardaugens cholate metabolism proceeds via the Δ 4,6 variant, as it is conserved in several bacteria from the genera Sphingobium , Novosphingobium , and Sphingomonas .",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Faced with multiple simultaneous adversities that extend beyond traditional adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), including systemic oppression and family separation due to detention or deportation, children of immigrants, a growing segment of the US population, face a public health crisis necessitating immediate attention. Experiencing these potentially traumatic events during the critical period of young childhood, especially in the absence of protective resources, can yield substantive short- and long-term developmental problems. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for evidence-based strategies for responding to ACEs and immigration-related adversities in young children of immigrants. This systematic review synthesizes literature indexed in PsycINFO from 2000 to 2025 on programs aimed at addressing ACEs in young children of immigrants in their natural settings ( n = 15). Eligible studies were screened following PICOTS inclusion criteria requiring programs to address ACEs or trauma exposure among young children of immigrants and be deliverable in early childhood education or faith-based settings. The review is framed by three interrelated core protective systems identified by ACE researchers as important for the prevention, detection, and intervention of ACEs in children: (1) building children’s individual strengths; (2) developing attachment to nurturing caregivers; and (3) building a protective community (Sciaraffa et al., 2018). From this perspective, we present evidence-based strategies and programs that address one or more of these protective systems, can be implemented with young children in early childhood education and care centers (ECEC) or faith communities, and are appropriate for addressing immigration-related adversity.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The School Anxiety Scale – Teacher Report (SAS-TR) assesses children’s anxiety from the teacher’s perspective. Originally developed in English and subsequently validated in Spanish and Iranian populations, a validated Italian version is still lacking. The current study aimed to translate, adapt and validate the SAS-TR into Italian. The SAS-TR was translated from English into Italian following 5 stages of cross-cultural adaptation and was assessed for face and content validity by five primary school teachers. A sample of 66 teachers completed the SAS-TR in a community sample of 201 children aged 6–11 years. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were performed. To investigate the concurrent validity, teachers also completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-Teacher (SDQ-T). After four weeks, the teachers re-provided ratings on the SAS-TR to assess test-retest reliability. SAS-TR ratings for the same children provided by permanent teachers (who have ≥ 10 teaching hours in classroom) and specialist teachers (who have &lt; 10 teaching hours in classroom) were compared. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the two-factor structure and the goodness fit of the scale, excluding item 12. The Italian SAS-TR exhibited strong face and content validity (mean = 3.71 ± 0.57), excellent internal consistency (α = 0.902) and almost perfect test-retest reliability over 4-weeks (ICC = 0.829). Additionally, moderate and statistically significant correlations between SAS-TR and SDQ-T “Emotional symptoms” subscale (ρ s = 0.62) supported concurrent validity. Finally, permanent teachers reported higher levels of anxiety symptoms compared to specialist teachers ( p &lt; 0.05). Overall, the Italian version of SAS-TR demonstrates adequate psychometric properties, suggesting its suitability for assessing anxiety symptoms in children aged 6–11 by teachers.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Clinical social workers represent the largest group of mental health professionals in the United States, playing a central role in delivering care across diverse populations. As frontline providers, clinical social workers must stay informed about emerging diagnostic trends and treatment innovations. Recently, the American Psychological Association (APA) introduced treatment guidelines for Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD), reflecting an urgent need to recognize and understand this condition and formulate practical clinical approaches. CPTSD is a distinctly different condition from PTSD and has catastrophic, long-term, far-reaching impacts on individuals, families, and societies. Despite its profound effects, CPTSD is rarely assessed and poorly understood. According to the new APA guidelines, as well as earlier expert guidelines, treatment for CPTSD requires tailored approaches that go beyond the standard unimodal therapies for PTSD. The literature unquestioningly supports phase-based treatments while stating that no phase-based treatment framework has yet been offered that addresses the complete symptom set of CPTSD. A five-phase framework is proposed as a new guideline for social workers navigating the lengthy treatment process. This conceptual framework integrates evidence-based practices and can be utilized by a solo practitioner or adapted for massed, concurrent treatment by a multi-disciplinary team.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Amid ongoing workforce challenges in early childhood education, little is known about factors contributing to educator wellbeing, particularly in the context of supporting trauma-impacted children. This exploratory study aims to identify factors associated with compassion satisfaction and compassion fatigue, as defined by burnout and secondary traumatic stress, among Australian early childhood educators. One hundred and thirty-five educators completed an online survey. Three multiple linear regression models were conducted using backwards elimination to identify independent predictors of wellbeing outcomes. Higher compassion satisfaction was uniquely associated with older age, lower qualification level, better workplace quality, greater awareness of trauma resources, and higher perceived confidence in supporting trauma-impacted children. Higher burnout was uniquely associated with younger age, lower workplace quality, not having prior experience supporting children impacted by trauma, and current exposure to these children. Higher secondary traumatic stress was associated with younger age, lower perceived knowledge on trauma-informed practice, and higher awareness of trauma resources. Findings highlight the need to prioritise support for educators who are working with trauma-impacted children to prevent burnout, especially for younger educators. Trauma-informed professional development that builds educator knowledge of trauma, confidence in supporting trauma-impacted children, and awareness of trauma-related resources has significant potential to enhance educator wellbeing and practice.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Recent research consistently provides strong empirical support for highlighting the impact of climate change (CC) on exports. Based on the current literature, this study investigates how CC influences export product diversification (EPD), particularly differences across countries’ income levels. The analysis uses data from 138 countries covering the years 1995 to 2020. We apply the panel Moment Quantile Regression (MQR) method to examine the heterogeneous effects of climate vulnerability and readiness on EPD. The results show that climate change increases export product concentration in low-income economies while supporting diversification in high-income countries. Additionally, our study found that import product diversification leads to EPD, although this relationship was not seen in low-income countries. Furthermore, a one-unit increase in the climate vulnerability index (CVI) leads to a 0.07–0.38 increase in the export concentration index across different quantiles. Importantly, these results remained consistent and valid when alternative econometric analyses and control variables were employed. These findings indicate that CC significantly influences export product diversification or intensification and that a country’s income status is essential to this effect. More importantly, the results highlight a new dimension of CC’s influence on trade, emphasizing its profound and far-reaching impacts.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose This study aimed to characterize the epidemiological and clinical profile of children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) evaluated at a regional Youth Psychiatric Emergency Unit, and to explore factors leading families to seek emergency psychiatric care. Methods A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted through retrospective chart review of patients seen in the emergency service over a one-year period. Patients with a confirmed ASD diagnosis were included. Categorical variables were compared using Pearson’s chi-square or Fisher’s exact test, and continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples Student’s t-test. Results During the study period, 112 patients with ASD (6.7% of total visits) were seen, and 26 (23.2%) received their first ASD diagnosis at the emergency service. The majority were male (83%) with a mean age of 10 ± 4 years. The mean age at diagnosis among those identified for the first time in the emergency setting was 8.86 ± 4.7 years, indicating a late diagnosis. The most frequent presenting complaints were agitation, aggression, and irritability. Compared to the non-ASD group, ASD patients had significantly higher rates of intellectual disability and epilepsy. Conclusion Findings highlight the role of psychiatric emergency units as potential entry points into the mental health system for children and adolescents with ASD, particularly in middle-income countries where early access to specialized care is often limited. These results underscore the importance of training emergency professionals in managing neurodevelopmental crises and providing families with guidance on how to respond to behavioral emergencies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract With respect to considerations of nuclear fusion systems, since the electromagnetic field in the wide frequency range from the static magnetic field to extremely high frequency was utilized for the plasma confinement, heating at the magnetic confinement fusion facilities, not only ionizing radiation but also non-ionizing radiation should be investigated and discussed in terms of occupational protection as one of the issues in fusion facilities. To clarify the behavior of non-ionizing radiation, leakage from electric and magnetic fields has been observed at the Large Helical Device (LHD), because a strong magnetic field generated by large superconducting magnet coils for plasma confinement, in addition to high-frequency and high-power oscillators for ion cyclotron range of frequencies (ICRF) and electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH) for plasma heating, are used. In the LHD experiments, magnetic field leakage has been observed at extremely low frequencies (ELFs) around a power supply system for superconducting magnet coils. The magnetic field outside the experimental hall and the intensity of electric field leakage from the oscillators for ICRF and ECRH are significantly below the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines and radio frequency exposure protection standards in Japan (RCR-STD38). The ICNIRP and RCR-STD38 provide guidelines for limiting exposure to electric and magnetic fields to protect against established adverse health effects. The guidelines for safety management to protect the working people in fusion facilities should be made clearer with respect to occupational protection from non-ionizing radiation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In a recent paper Kirtley and Milroy [D. Kirtley, R. Milroy, J. of Fusion Energy (2023) 42:30] discuss the Helion concept for a pulsed reactor, in which two supersonic field-reversed configurations (FRCs) merge and the resulting plasmoid is adiabatically compressed to fusion conditions. Using D-He3 as fuel this would allow for efficient electromagnetic energy conversion during the subsequent expansion phase. Essential for their very promising projections of energy gain is the assumed large temperature ratio between ions and electrons ( $$\\:{T}_{i}/{T}_{e}\\approx\\:10$$ ) resulting initially from the supersonic plasmoid collision and the following adiabatic compression. For reactor-relevant conditions, however, the collisional ion to electron power transfer exceeds the fusion power by more than an order of magnitude at $$\\:{T}_{i}$$ =100 keV (and by over two orders at $$\\:{T}_{i}$$ =40 keV). Even if this exchange does not change total pressure, it rapidly erodes $$\\:{T}_{i}/{T}_{e}\\gg\\:1$$ and causes the time-integrated fusion energy yield to fall well below values inferred from the initial, non-equilibrated state. While this does not preclude a D-He3 FRC reactor our analysis implies much tighter requirements on plasma lifetime, anomalous losses, and direct-conversion efficiency than suggested in D. Kirtley, R.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Self-reported child abuse is highly prevalent in rural Bangladesh, but caregiver-reported rates have not yet been explored. Purpose To investigate caregiver’s self-reported child physical abuse (PA) practices and estimate the prevalence of gender-specific PA among children in rural Bangladesh. Methods A total of 1418 caregivers were randomly recruited from a population-based surveillance area in a northwestern district of Bangladesh. Data was collected from April 1 to May 31, 2017, using the ISPCAN Child Abuse Screening Tool-Parent (ICAST-P) to collect data. Past-year (PY) prevalence was calculated by categorizing all forms of PA into any versus no exposure in the past year. For lifetime prevalence, different forms of PA were categorized based on any versus no exposure either in the past year or at any point in time. Multiple logistic regression was employed to estimate the risk factors of physical abuse among children. Ethical approval was obtained from Bangladesh and Sweden. Results Moderate physical abuse (PA) was reported in 92% and 94% of cases in PY and LT, respectively, with severe forms reported in 15% and 18%. Male children were more likely to be subjected to hitting with objects, ear twisting, and beating ( P &lt; .05), while females were more likely to experience burning ( P &lt; .05). Risk factors for PA included male gender (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.08–1.71), older age (OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.03–1.09) and developmental delays (OR = 3.02, 95% CI = 1.87–4.88), living with biological parents (OR = 3.82; 95% CI: 2.24–6.52), caregivers’ financial problems (OR = 2.70, CI = 1.72 to 4.23), childhood victimization of caregivers, male parents with lower education, low socioeconomic status, perceived poor health, and belief in corporal punishment. Conclusions PA is a common form of harsh parental disciplinary action in Bangladesh. Both boys and girls are victims of PA.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Photocatalysis has become a pivotal technology for solar-to-chemical energy conversion and environmental purification, yet its widespread implementation remains hindered by insufficient light harvesting, rapid electron–hole recombination, and limited accessibility of active sites. The emergence of two-dimensional (2D) materials—including graphene derivatives, transition-metal dichalcogenides, layered double hydroxides, g-C₃N₄, and MXenes—has opened new frontiers for overcoming these intrinsic bottlenecks. Owing to their atomic-level thickness, tunable electronic structure, large surface-to-volume ratio, and superior charge transport characteristics, 2D architectures provide a versatile platform for nanoarchitectonics-driven photocatalyst design. This review systematically examines the principles and strategies of nanoarchitectonics applied to 2D materials, covering controlled defect engineering, heteroatom doping, interfacial coupling, phase modulation, and hierarchical assembly. Mechanistic insights into charge separation pathways, band structure tailoring, surface redox kinetics, and synergistic effects arising from 2D–2D and 2D–3D hybrid systems are highlighted to elucidate how structural manipulation at the nanoscale governs photocatalytic behavior. Additionally, the article outlines key application pathways of engineered 2D photocatalysts in hydrogen evolution, CO₂ reduction, nitrogen fixation, and degradation of emerging pollutants, emphasizing the relationship between material architecture and functional performance. Finally, current challenges—including long-term stability, scalability of synthesis, environmental and toxicity considerations, and the need for operando characterization—are critically discussed. Perspectives for future research, such as integrating machine-learning-guided material discovery, multi-component nanoarchitectures, and sustainable fabrication routes, are proposed to guide the development of next-generation high-efficiency photocatalytic systems. Collectively, this review provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and advancing the nanoarchitectonics of 2D materials toward transformative photocatalytic technologies.

Characterisation of the resonators and bolometer measurements are shown, including the use of nonlinear operation and the corresponding corrections. The bolometer contains two vibrating wire resonators, enabling heat injection calibration and simultaneous bolometer tracking measurements. Coincident events measured on both vibrating wire resonators verify their response. We also demonstrate proof of concept frequency multiplexed readout. Development of these measurement techniques lays the foundations for the use of superfluid helium-3 bolometers, instrumented with vibrating nanomechanical resonators, for future low-threshold dark matter searches.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In this study, the exergy analysis and second law efficiency of two separate experimental vortex tubes, one single and the other cascade-connected, were calculated and evaluated independently. This experimental study was conducted for the first time in the literature to validate the hypothesis that a cascade-connected vortex tube would exhibit superior second-law efficiency and lower exergy losses compared to a single vortex tube. Air was used as the pressurized fluid in the vortex tubes of the experimental systems. Moreover, grey relational analysis was utilized to analyze complex multi-response systems. Based on the results, a comparison of the exergy analyses for the cascade counterflow vortex tube and the single counterflow vortex tube revealed that, at a pressure of 650 kPa, the cascade counterflow Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube (CRHVT) with five brass nozzles exhibited an exergy loss of 44.57 kJkg −1 . Additionally, the CRHVT with five brass nozzles achieved the highest second law efficiency among the two systems, approximately 71%, at the same pressure. The findings from the grey relational analysis further demonstrated that the cascade counterflow vortex tube with five brass nozzles exhibited the best system performance. At a pressure of 650 kPa, the second law efficiency of this configuration was approximately 10% higher than that of the single counterflow Ranque-Hilsch vortex tube (SRHVT) under identical experimental conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Shannon entropy for discrete distributions is a fundamental and widely used concept, but its continuous analogue, known as differential entropy, lacks essential properties such as positivity and compatibility with the discrete case. In this paper, we analyze this incompatibility in detail and illustrate it through examples. To overcome these limitations, we proposemodified versions of Shannon and Rényi entropy that retain key properties, including positivity, while remaining close to the classical forms. We also define compatible discrete functionals and study the behavior of the proposed entropies for the normal and exponential distributions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Although Scedosporium species may cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients, little is known about their pathogenic mechanisms. The thioredoxin reductases (TrxRs) of Scedosporium apiospermum are thought to play an important role in protecting the fungus against oxidative stress. The genes that encode these proteins are part of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) which ensure the synthesis of non-ribosomal peptides. Due to the discrepancies between chemical studies and bioinformatic predictions regarding the product of the BGC comprising the TrxR-encoding gene SAPIO_CDS1830 , a large-scale study of almost 300 fungal genomes was undertaken to search for BGCs that could potentially synthesize homodipeptides. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino acid sequence of the adenylation domain of a large number of non-ribosomal peptide synthases confirmed the assembly of two phenylalanine molecules. Synteny analysis clearly showed that this BGC ensures the synthesis of some aranotin-related hybrid compounds, called boydins. This BGC comprised 15 genes, including one encoding a polyketide synthase, which allows the synthesis of the polyketide chain attached to the dipeptide skeleton. The orthologues of all members of this BGC were also identified in all available Scedosporium genomes, as well as in other Sordariomycetes and even in some phylogenetically distant molds living as endophytes or plants pathogens, or on decaying wood. These secondary metabolites, which may therefore not be specific to the Scedosporium genus, could play a role in evasion of the fungus to the oxidative stress, as suggested by the overexpression of several members of this BGC in response to oxidative stress.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In this paper we discuss the problem of applying the Maximum Entropy Principle to Markov systems to infer the transition rates using information on the stationary state. We use the Perry’s theorem to maximize the dynamical entropy and we generalize the results to Markov systems that express non equilibrium stationary states using the Minimum Entropy Production Principle. We apply these results to a class of non-linear random walk models that simulate the urban mobility on transport network. The main goal is to define data driven simple models that can highlight the interplay between the geometric features of the transport network and the traffic load distribution, in the formation of local congestion and its spreading in the network. Our approach proposes a roadmap to define predictive stochastic models for the congestion formation, using data that can be available in any city. In this way one can addresses the questions if these data contains enough information to set up a predictive model without further assumptions, and if Markov models for urban mobility are suitable to study congestion formation simplifying the great complexity of agent based models. We refer explicitly to the city of Bologna in Italy where a digital twin project for the urban mobility is being developed.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Urbanization is a stressor that can exacerbate climate change impacts. Urban ecosystems are hotter and drier than their rural counterparts, due to a lack of vegetation and an abundance of impermeable surfaces that characterize cities. Urban greening projects can reverse these trends through microclimate cooling and humidification. Vegetation and aridity gradients have the capacity to modify how neighboring plants interact with one another: plant neighbors may benefit one another through facilitation in hot and dry environments but experience more competition in cooler and more humid areas. We examined how herbaceous plants can ameliorate heat and water stress across an established urban aridity gradient in the greater Los Angeles area. Methods We measured 162 plants at 81 plots in 27 sites across a well-established urban-to-rural gradient. In each plot, we identified two pre-existing focal individuals: we removed the neighboring plants for one of these, and left the community intact around the other. We then measured growth of the two focal plants and placed temperature and humidity sensors near each. We also measured light above and below the canopy and total precipitation. Results We found that across the urban aridity gradient, the hottest sites experienced the most vegetative microclimate amelioration. We also found that neighboring plants had positive effects on growth (facilitation), but only when neighbors also cooled microclimate temperature and decreased microclimate vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Facilitation between neighbors was also greatest at the sites with the least precipitation. Conclusion Previous studies have shown that plants may compete for limited resources but we show that interactions can shift to be more facilitative along an urban aridity gradient. Future work should use this information to augment restoration plans in urban environments.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Entrepreneurship research faces a growing challenge: studies using advanced AI methods are trusted less than those that do not. In a survey of 172 entrepreneurship scholars, we document a substantial trust discount—AI-based studies are perceived, as a category, to be significantly less credible than those using conventional statistical methods. To explain this outcome, we adapt Akerlof’s market-for-lemons framework and introduce the concept of “social lemons”: studies devalued due to deep epistemic opacity. This stems from a double-black-box challenge: opaque AI methods are applied to uncertain, elusive entrepreneurial phenomena. Echoing dysfunctional market dynamics in Akerlof’s market-for-lemons framework, this dual opacity can create conditions whereby flawed research goes undetected, while high-quality work is crowded out. We outline a multi-stakeholder roadmap for safeguarding research credibility, offering actionable measures to help transform today’s trust discount into a future trust dividend—positioning AI as an accelerator of insight, rather than a source of doubt.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Data reduction has become increasingly important in modern technology, as classical statistical methods are often rendered impractical by computational limitations. In the present paper, we address the situation of multiple linear regression for an extraordinarily large number of observations, but only a few covariates. Subsampling aims at the selection of a given proportion of the existing original data. Under distributional assumptions on the covariates, we derive D -optimal subsampling designs and study their theoretical properties. We make use of fundamental concepts of optimal design theory and an equivalence theorem from constrained convex optimization. The thus obtained subsampling designs provide simple rules for whether to accept or reject a data point, allowing for an easy algorithmic implementation. In addition, we propose a simplified subsampling method with lower computational complexity that deviates from the D -optimal design. We present a simulation study, comparing both subsampling schemes with the IBOSS method in the case of a fixed size of the subsample.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Turkish coffee is a widely consumed coffee type, generating large amounts of waste daily. Recycling coffee waste plays a crucial role in mitigating potential environmental risks. In this regard, we propose a study to explore the reuse of Turkish coffee waste (TCW) by incorporating it into a chitosan solution to create novel chitosan/TCW biocomposite beads. The prepared chitosan/TCW biocomposite was characterized through FTIR, BET surface area, SEM, and pH pzc analyses. The impact of various parameters, such as initial pH, contact time, Sr(II) concentration, and temperature, on Sr(II) sorption was examined using a 4-factor, 5-level Central Composite Design (CCD). The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results showed that the Model F -value of 97.32 indicates the model's significance. The coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) between the experimental and predicted results was 0.989. The adsorption data were best described by the D–R isotherm, which exhibited the highest determination coefficient ( R 2 = 0.999) and the lowest prediction errors, indicating superior agreement with experimental values. The biocomposite's maximum adsorption capacity was determined to be 17.20 mg g –1 . The kinetics of Sr(II) adsorption are well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Adsorption process is spontaneous, exothermic, and becomes slightly more favorable with increasing temperature. Competitive ion studies further revealed that the presence of competing cations significantly reduced Sr(II) uptake. Overall, the results demonstrated that the chitosan/TCW biocomposite can be effectively used for removing strontium from a wide range of aqueous solutions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Sixth-generation (6 G) mobile networks is expected to revolutionize wireless connectivity, paving the way for the Internet of Everything (IoE) and enabling seamless communication between devices, people, and organizations. Advanced techniques, such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO), and millimeter wave (mmWave) are proposed to deliver high data rates and increase the capacity and spectral efficiency of ultra-dense device networks. However, in scenarios like enhanced remote area communications (eRAC), the use of sub-gigahertz frequencies and TV white spaces (TVWS) is essential to provide Internet services in rural and remote areas, making these advanced techniques impractical. In this context, this paper proposes a new multiple access approach based on the faster-than-Nyquist generalized frequency division multiplexing (FTN-GFDM) waveform to improve user throughput and network capacity in remote areas. Resources in the FTN-GFDM time-frequency grid are allocated with the goal of avoiding inter-user interference (IUI) caused by signal overlap in the time or frequency domains, enabling equalization and detection of user signals without loss of bit error rate (BER) performance. This paper exploits resource allocation strategies and uplink and downlink scenarios for faster-than-Nyquist generalized frequency division multiple access (FTN-GFDMA) schemes, evaluating the effects of interference on BER performance and detection complexity.",

    "Abstract": "This study aims to examine the relation between daily maximum exposure to Particulate Matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>), high wind speed, and minimum visibility, and COVID-19 cases in El Paso County, Texas, a dust-prone region. A time-series analysis using a generalized linear model with a Poisson model was employed to analyze relative risks of COVID-19 cases in El Paso (March 2020 to November 2021). A total of 156,299 cases were diagnosed during the study period. A 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<sub>2.5</sub> levels was linked with higher risk ratio (RR) of COVID-19 (Lag Days 1 to 3) [lag1: RR = 1.004; 95% CI: (1.003-1.005), lag2: RR = 1.006; 95% CI: (1.005-1.007), & lag 3: RR = 1.004; 95% CI: (1.003-1.005)], followed by a decrease in cases. Similarly, a 4.47 m/s rise in maximum wind speed was associated with an elevated RR of cases on Lag Day 4 [lag4: RR = 1.009; 95% CI: (1.003-1.014)], after which numbers begin to drop. Finally, a 4.83 km decrease in minimum daily visibility was correlated with an increased RR of cases on Lag Days 1 and 2 [lag1: RR = 1.031; 95% CI: (1.023-1.039), & lag2: RR = 1.018; 95% CI: (1.011-1.024)], with a decrease on Lag days 3, 4 and 5 and resurgence on Lag days 6 and 7 [lag6: RR = 1.028; 95% CI: (1.021-1.036), & lag7: RR = 1.046; 95% CI: (1.038-1.055)]. PM<sub>2.5</sub>, wind speed, and visibility influencing COVID-19 cases in El Paso highlight the need for evidence-based interventions, including information, education, and communication programs, early-warning systems, cross-border air-quality management, real-time monitoring, and stricter emission controls.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Cyanide is extensively used in hydrometallurgical leaching due to its strong metal-chelating ability, yet its acute toxicity raises major environmental concerns. This study evaluates photoactivated BiVO₄ synthesized by the sol–gel method and combined with ozone for the degradation of metal–cyanide complexes in alkaline matrices (pH 10.5) containing silver, copper, iron, lead, and zinc, representative of effluents from silver leaching in the Mexican mining industry. Synthetic solutions were prepared and characterized to reproduce these conditions. Thermodynamic stability diagrams indicated that free cyanide and complexes such as Ag(CN)₂⁻, Cu(CN)₃ 2 ⁻, and Fe(CN)₆ 4 ⁻ persist at alkaline pH, while lead and zinc showed no tendency to form stable cyanide complexes. Oxidative treatments favored complex dissociation, with cyanate predicted as the main by-product; experimentally, ammonium was identified as the dominant degradation product. The BiVO₄/ozone system under irradiation demonstrated superior performance compared to individual processes, achieving faster cyanide abatement and improved efficiency. Kinetics followed a modified Langmuir–Hinshelwood model that accounted for both surface-mediated photocatalysis and bulk-phase ozone reactions. Complete cyanide removal was achieved in two consecutive cycles, though partial deactivation occurred in the third cycle due to BiVO₄ surface poisoning by adsorbed metals, confirmed by SEM/EDS and atomic absorption. Despite gradual loss of activity, the coupled process consistently removed both free and complexed cyanide while reducing ozone demand compared with conventional ozonation. These findings highlight photocatalytic ozonation with BiVO₄ as a promising and sustainable strategy for the treatment of metallurgical effluents, offering efficient pollutant degradation and lower oxidant consumption in comparison with conventional approaches.

    "Abstract": "Abstract The cultivation of Daucus carota L. (carrot) on soils polluted with trace elements (TE) constitutes an innovative phytomanagement approach, combining significant ecological and economic benefits. This plant species exhibits a notable capacity to extract trace elements from the soil while generating valuable biomass, primarily intended for hydrodistillation to produce high-quality essential oils (EO). Carrots exhibit an enhanced capacity to accumulate cadmium in their leaf tissues, with a high bioconcentration factor (BCF = 1.71), as well as significant zinc accumulation. Furthermore, the cultivation of this biennial plant promotes an increase in soil microbial biomass, as assessed by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) content, specifically enriching populations of Gram− bacteria, Gram+ bacteria, and saprotrophic fungi, thereby contributing to the modulation of microbial dynamics and the alleviation of stress within soil microbial communities. The EO extracted from carrot seeds contain TE concentrations below the quantification limit compared to other commercially available EO. Chemical analysis of the EO reveals a composition similar to that of commercial oils, with the major components being carotol (27.53%), an oxygenated sesquiterpene, and sabinene (26.08%), a monoterpene hydrocarbon. These EO have been extensively evaluated for their biological properties, demonstrating significant antifungal activity against Fusarium culmorum (IC50 = 0.57 ± 0.11 mg/ml) and Zymoseptoria tritici (IC50 = 1.09 ± 0.12 mg/ml), as well as antigermination activity against Blumeria graminis spores (IC50 = 1.47 ± 0.15 mg/ml). Additionally, these EO exhibit notable herbicidal properties, particularly in inhibiting root elongation and germination of the monocots species Lolium perenne (ryegrass) and the dicots species Lactuca sativa (lettuce). These findings highlight the potential of carrot as a tool for phytoremediation and the production of high-value bioactive compounds. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), extensively used across multiple industries, has long been discussed for its potential to enhance heavy metal mobility in aquatic systems, with studies yielding contradictory results. This study examines the remobilization of particle-bound lead from suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the Innerste River (Lower Saxony, Germany), which is affected by historical mining and known for substantial Pb contamination. Using real river water containing its native SPM to preserve the chemical matrix of the system, we assessed Pb partitioning between total and dissolved phases to evaluate EDTA’s remobilization potential. Baseline dissolved lead concentrations reached up to 1.8 µg L −1 (median 0.69 µg L −1 ). Across all batch experiments, a measurable increase in the dissolved Pb fraction occurred only at EDTA concentrations far exceeding those measured in the river (0.68–3.8 µg L −1 ). Bayesian concentration–response modelling yielded no-effect concentrations (NEC) between 210 and 530 µg L −1 . Complementary speciation modelling showed that shifts in Pb speciation occur only at EDTA concentrations near the experimentally derived NEC values. These findings show that current EDTA concentrations in the Innerste are unlikely to remobilize Pb from SPM. The study also provides a statistically supported NEC estimate based on batch experiments using unaltered river water containing its naturally present SPM. To our knowledge, this is the first application of Bayesian NEC modelling to EDTA-induced Pb remobilization.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Early-life exposures could affect the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in adulthood, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We included 319,951 (54.5% women) UK Biobank participants free of T2D at baseline and within the first year of follow-up to investigate whether early-life exposures contribute to T2D through biological aging estimated using the Klemera–Doubal (KDM) and PhenoAge methods. We first examined associations of exposures with biological age and T2D, respectively, using multivariable-adjusted linear models and Cox regression models. Next, we investigated the role of biological age acceleration in exposure-T2D associations using mediation analyses. Overall, the mean (standard deviation) chronological age of participants was 56.3 (8.1) years, KDM age was 40.9 (13.1) years, and PhenoAge was 44.4 (10.0) years. 17,062 T2D cases developed during a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 14.3 (13.5–15.0) years. Maternal smoking around birth, being part of a multiple birth, earlier puberty, and being relatively plumper or thinner at age ten were associated with both a higher biological age and T2D risk, while having a higher birth weight and being breastfed were associated with a lower T2D risk. Biological age acceleration partly mediated the exposure-T2D associations, ranging from a proportion of 8.3% (95%CI: 6.0–13.1%) of the association between birthweight-T2D being mediated by PhenoAge to a proportion of 27.7% (95%CI: 15.3–48.5%) of the association between breastfeeding-T2D being mediated by KDM. In conclusion, early-life exposures were associated with biological age acceleration that partly mediated the exposure-T2D associations, highlighting the importance of addressing early-life risks and biological aging in prevention strategies.",

Building on a systematic literature review and the HOMALS technique, the research identifies four thematic clusters that structure the contemporary conceptual space of AI in business environments: ethical-social governance, strategic-technological core, digital infrastructure, and decision-oriented automation. The findings expose a latent structural tension between technocratic efficiency and ethical legitimacy, highlighting the need for hybrid models that integrate algorithmic capabilities with principles of responsible governance. Within this framework, variables such as user acceptance, transparency, and hybrid cognitive architectures emerge as key dimensions for understanding and designing AI-mediated decision processes in entrepreneurial contexts. The study proposes a conceptual model that articulates these dimensions and provides a theoretical basis for future investigations and practical initiatives aimed at the reflexive, responsible, and sustainable implementation of intelligent technologies in contemporary business ecosystems.",

    "Abstract": "Natural phenolic acid compounds have been extensively studied for their anti-inflammatory properties, particularly in the context of inflammation-associated diseases. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of trans-cinnamic acid on neutrophil accumulation during inflammatory processes using both in vivo and in vitro approaches. For the in vivo experiments, LPS-induced pleurisy was used in mice pretreated with trans-cinnamic acid. Inflammatory parameters, including plasma leakage, leukocyte infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine levels (IL-6 and TNF-α), were quantified in the pleural exudate. In vitro, the effects of trans-cinnamic acid on neutrophil chemotaxis toward CXCL1 were assessed using the Boyden chamber assay. Additionally, human endothelial EA.hy926 cells were stimulated with TNF-α to evaluate neutrophil adhesion and the expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 following trans-cinnamic acid treatment. Pretreatment with trans-cinnamic acid significantly inhibited LPS-induced pleurisy in mice by reducing protein-rich exudate formation, neutrophil infiltration, and local concentrations of TNF-α and IL-6. In vitro, trans-cinnamic acid did not alter CXCL1-induced neutrophil chemotaxis, nor the secretion of CXCL8 produced by TNF-α-stimulated EA.hy926 cells. However, it markedly reduced neutrophil adhesion to TNF-α-activated EA.hy926 cells. This reduction was associated with the downregulation of ICAM-1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Overall, these findings demonstrated that trans-cinnamic acid exerted anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting vascular permeability and leukocyte recruitment, particularly through the suppression of ICAM-1-mediated neutrophil adhesion to endothelial cells. These results support trans-cinnamic acid as a promising candidate for the development of new therapeutic agents targeting inflammatory diseases.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Coronary artery disease (CAD), one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, necessitates effective risk assessment strategies, with coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring via computed tomography (CT) being a key method for prevention. Traditional methods, primarily based on UNET architectures implemented on pre-built models, face challenges like the scarcity of annotated CT scans containing CAC and imbalanced datasets, leading to reduced performance in segmentation and scoring tasks. In this study, we address these limitations by introducing DINO-LG, a novel label-guided extension of DINO (self-distillation with no labels) that incorporates targeted augmentation on annotated calcified regions during self-supervised pre-training. Our three-stage pipeline integrates Vision Transformer (ViT-Base/8) feature extraction via DINO-LG trained on 914 CT scans comprising 700 gated and 214 non-gated acquisitions, linear classification to identify calcified slices, and U-NET segmentation for CAC quantification and Agatston scoring. DINO-LG achieved 89% sensitivity and 90% specificity for detecting CAC-containing CT slices, compared to standard DINO’s 79% sensitivity and 77% specificity, reducing false-negative and false-positive rates by 49% and 57% respectively. The integrated system achieves 90% accuracy in CAC risk classification on 45 test patients, outperforming standalone U-NET segmentation (76% accuracy) while processing only the relevant subset of CT slices. This targeted approach enhances CAC scoring accuracy by feeding the UNET model with relevant slices, improving diagnostic precision while lowering healthcare costs by minimizing unnecessary tests and treatments.

Existing efforts have focused primarily on generating and evaluating explanations for black-box models, while a critical gap in directly enhancing models remains through these evaluations. It is important to consider the potential of this explanation process to improve model quality with feedback on training as well. XAI may be used to improve model performance while increasing model explainability. Under this view, this paper introduces Transformation-Selective hidden input evaluation for learning dynamics (T-SHIELD), a regularization family designed to improve model quality by hiding features of input, forcing the model to generalize without those features. Within this family, we propose XAI-SHIELD (X-SHIELD), a regularization for explainable artificial intelligence that uses explanations to select specific features to hide. In contrast to conventional approaches, X-SHIELD regularization seamlessly integrates into the objective function, enhancing model explainability while also improving performance. Experimental validation on benchmark datasets underscores X-SHIELD’s effectiveness in improving performance and overall explainability. The improvement is validated through experiments comparing models with and without X-SHIELD regularization, with further analysis exploring the rationale behind its design choices. This establishes X-SHIELD regularization as a promising pathway for developing reliable artificial intelligence regularization.",

    "Abstract": "Cocaine use disorder (CUD) is a significant public health problem with few treatment options. Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex has shown promise as a therapeutic tool for neural alterations in CUD. However, its effects on white matter (WM) microstructure and their role in treatment efficacy remain uncertain. This study aimed to assess the global impact of rTMS on WM microstructure in CUD patients. In this study, we made a longitudinal correlational tractography analysis that was conducted using Quantitative Anisotropy (QA) on diffusion MRI data from CUD patients who received either active rTMS (n = 22) or sham rTMS (n = 18) treatment. Imaging data were collected before (T0) and after two weeks of treatment (T1). Correlations were derived using nonparametric Spearman partial correlation, accounting for gender, age, and age at substance initiation through multiple regression. Tracks were selected using a p-FDR threshold of 0.05. A significant QA increase was found in 9718 tracts across the whole brain in the active rTMS group compared to the sham group, with no observed reduction in QA. The affected WM tracts included cerebellar, commissural, associative, and projective fibers, mainly in the left hemisphere. The study suggests that rTMS induces widespread changes in WM microstructure, potentially improving communication between brain regions and cognitive control in CUD patients. However, the small sample size limits the findings' generalizability, highlighting the need for larger, longitudinal studies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) are commonly experienced in people with chronic pain. Reduced white matter microstructural integrity in the uncinate fasciculus and the cingulum has separately been reported in chronic pain and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) studies. However, the relationship between chronic pain, PTSS and white matter integrity remains unclear. This study aims to disentangle the relationship between PTSS severity and white matter microstructural integrity common across different chronic pain conditions. Thirty-six subjects with chronic pain and 20 without chronic pain (controls) underwent diffusion weighted imaging and completed the civilian version of the PTSD CheckList (PCL-C). Average fractional anisotropy (FA) values were extracted from the uncinate fasciculus, and the cingulate and hippocampal portions of the cingulum. A series of multiple linear regressions determined the main effects of group, PTSS severity (PCL-C total score) and their interactions on each region separately. The group-by-PTSS interaction was significantly associated with uncinate fasciculus FA variations. Moderation analysis indicated that increasing PTSS severity was significantly associated with reduced uncinate fasciculus FA in the control group, but not in the chronic pain group. No other significant association was found for any other ROI FA values. Consistent with previous studies, increasing PTSS levels were associated with reduced FA of the uncinate fasciculus in controls, but not in people with chronic pain. Other mechanisms may be at play in chronic pain, including the interplay with other psychopathological problems or specific pain type effects.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The tuned viscous mass damper (TVMD), composed of an inerter, a tuning spring, and a damping component, has emerged in recent years as one of the most successful structural control devices. The TVMD efficiently absorbs vibration energy through the damping component by resonating the inerter with the tuning spring. However, concerns have been raised regarding the excessive reaction forces that are exerted on the primary structure by the TVMD, potentially leading to structural damage. To address this issue, this study proposes an active control strategy that employs a tuned inertial mass electromagnetic transducer (TIMET). The TIMET has the same configuration as the TVMD but replaces the damping component with an electromagnetic motor, which is controlled by using a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm with acceleration feedback. To evaluate the structural control performance and the control force generated by the proposed strategy, a numerical example involving a five-story shear building model with TIMETs installed between floors is presented. Comparative analyses are conducted using models lacking control devices but including TVMDs, subjected to four earthquake records. The results demonstrate that the force-constrained MPC strategy effectively limits the control forces of the TIMETs, while simultaneously reducing the response displacements and accelerations of the primary structure.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study examines family business performance through three theoretical lenses: dynamic capabilities, entrepreneurial orientation, and socioemotional wealth. Data were gathered from 156 Spanish family businesses and interviews with eight family business CEOs. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data. The results reveal valuable findings. Dynamic capabilities, particularly sensing, seizing, and resource reconfiguration, are critical for navigating dynamic environments and achieving sustainable competitive advantage. Entrepreneurial orientation, defined by innovation, proactivity, and risk-taking, also enhances performance, especially in contexts of technological and digital transformation. Socioemotional wealth, which encompasses family control, social ties, and legacy preservation, influences strategic decision-making but has a weaker effect than dynamic capabilities and entrepreneurial orientation. Collectively, the findings underscore the interplay of adaptability, entrepreneurial strategies, and family values in driving the resilience of family businesses. Spain provides an illustrative context because family businesses represent over 92% of all Spanish firms and include global leaders in the food, fashion, infrastructure, and tourism industries. Insights derived from this study therefore offer valuable implications for family businesses worldwide. Overall, the current study contributes to the research by integrating these three frameworks and highlighting their individual and combined roles in performance optimization.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose of Review Shared decision making (SDM) is integral to clinical decision making for OAB. SDM is a collaborative process that takes patients’ values, preferences, and goals into account when deciding on their treatment options. Decision aids (DAs) can support SDM and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) help to assess the outcomes most important to the patient. Recent Findings Twenty-five articles were retrieved and reviewed. Our search for literature about SDM in OAB found that physician recommendation is a key decisional component for patients yet that physicians’ priorities may differ widely from patients’ preferences. We evaluated currently available decision aids for OAB and found that none of the peer reviewed aids are publicly available, though non-peer reviewed, paper-based decision aids are available online. At least 10 PROs are available for OAB, these are regularly used in trials of efficacy and are increasingly being implemented in clinical practice. Finally, artificial intelligence applications such as large language models and machine learning based clinical risk prediction tools are emerging as a new facet to augment SDM, but there are limitations on the quality and the clinical implementation of these tools. Summary Decision aids and patient reported outcome measures are integral to the delivery of patient-centered, individualized, shared decision making for OAB. Despite this, few freely available DAs exist and many PROs are available, which makes comparison of outcomes between treatments challenging. Emerging AI technologies may further augment the SDM however require validation prior to clinical use.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study aimed to assess the use of thermosonication (TS, a combined technique of thermal and ultrasonic treatments) to prepare paraprobiotics (non-viable probiotics) from Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ( LP ) with antidiabetic potential. Hence, the α-amylase and α-glucosidase (the enzymes involved in diabetes) inhibitory activities of LP paraprobiotics ( LP P) were measured. Flow cytometry (FC) was used to confirm the successful production of LP P and to differentiate it from viable probiotics and other derivatives, such as postbiotics. The TS process significantly enhanced the enzymatic inhibitory activities of LP P. Under the optimal LP P obtaining conditions, these activities exceeded those of the original probiotic ( LP ) and even those of LP P obtained through the conventional heating method. FC results revealed that the TS process significantly affected LP ’s cell integrity (CI). The statistical criteria used to assess model accuracy showed that the full quadratic model was more predictive for all the responses, including CI, α-amylase inhibitory activity (AIA), and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity (GIA) of LP P. The independent variables of TS time, TS temperature, and the interaction between ultrasound amplitude and TS time showed the highest effects on the CI, AIA, and GIA, respectively. The TS process with an ultrasound amplitude of 66%, a TS temperature of 63.5 °C, and a TS time of 58.5 min was identified as the optimal conditions for producing LP P, which had CI, AIA, and GIA values of 98.70, 17.17, and 63.83%, respectively. These findings suggest that TS processing is a promising method to produce functional paraprobiotics with potential antidiabetic properties.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract L-asparaginase (ASNase) is one of the most clinically relevant biopharmaceuticals but proteolysis impairs the enzyme half-life. ASNase P40S/S206C was developed to overcome proteolysis and in addition pegylation can be used to improve half-life and thermostability. Here Cys206 and N-terminal residues were explored as pegylation sites for a potential new biobetter. Optimal mono-pegylation of Cys (Cys-PEG-ASNase) provided similar yields compared to N-terminal mono-pegylation (NT-PEG-ASNase) but at lower PEG concentration. Specific activity was higher for Cys-PEG-ASNase than NT-PEG-ASNase. The role of pegylation site in activity was confirmed by activation energy ( Ea ) and enthalpy variation (Δ H 70ºC ) of the ASNase-catalysed reaction. Pegylation in both sites increased enzyme thermostability and consequently shelf-life stability. The variation of Gibbs free-energy of enzyme thermo-inactivation (Δ G d ) showed higher stabilization by Cys conjugation, while enthalpy (Δ H d ) and entropy (Δ S d ) evidenced an increase in aggregation upon thermo-inactivation, higher for Cys-PEG-ASNase.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The aims of this study were to investigate the binding of platelets to colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, platelet activation by CRC cells, and determine the effect of platelets and platelet releasate containing extracellular vesicles on CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion following aspirin pretreatment. Platelets from healthy individuals were pretreated with aspirin before co-incubation with CRC cells. Platelet activation by CRC cells was analysed by flow cytometry and the binding of platelets to CRC cells investigated using immunofluorescence microscopy. Platelet releasate containing extracellular vesicles was generated by centrifugation. The effect of platelets and platelet releasate on CRC cell proliferation was investigated using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl esterand dimethylthiazol-carboxymethoxyphenyl-sulfophenyl-tetrazolium assays. Migration and invasion were examined using Transwell assays. HCT15 and HCT116 CRC cells activated platelets, with higher numbers of CRC cells activating more platelets, however aspirin was unable to inhibit platelet activation. Platelets are also able to bind to HCT15 and HCT116 cells. Platelets and platelet releasate did not affect HCT15 and HCT116 proliferation, however, aspirin directly inhibited the proliferation of both cell lines. Platelets and platelet releasate significantly increased the migration and invasion of HCT116, but not HCT15 cell lines. Platelets adhere to and are activated by CRC cells lines, with aspirin unable to inhibit this activation. CRC proliferation was not affected by platelets, however the effect on cancer cell migration and invasion was dependent upon the cell line, suggesting the effects of platelets and platelet releasate containing extracellular vesicles may be patient specific. The inhibitory effect of aspirin on colorectal cancer proliferation is a direct effect on the cancer cell and independent of platelets and extracellular vesicles.",

    "Abstract": "Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) commonly occurs during the treatment of ischemic stroke and leads to severe consequences, including neuronal death and permanent loss of motor function. Accurate differentiation between the ischemic penumbra (IP) and the ischemic core area is crucial for timely intervention. Multimodal MRI plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis and treatment evaluation of acute ischemic stroke. PANoptosis is a recently discovered form of programmed cell death including apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyroptosis. It has been implicated in neuronal loss during CIRI, especially through absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2). Melatonin (Mel) exerts neuroprotective effects; however, whether PANoptosis is the main cause of neuronal death in CIRI and whether Mel exerts anti-PANoptotic effects to rescue CIRI remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the effects of Mel on PANoptosis in the IP of rats with CIRI and to systematically investigate the underlying mechanisms using multimodal MRI combined with histopathologic techniques. A rat CIRI model comprising 42 healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 240-270 g, was established using the modified Zea-Longa wire bolus method. Multimodal MRI, including T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-MRI, and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), was performed to evaluate the ischemic lesions and identify IP. T2WI, DWI-MRI, and tissue staining demonstrated that Mel significantly reduced infarct volume, improved neuron morphology, and decreased the proportion of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells. The IP was identified as the mismatch region between CEST and DWI-MRI, which was expanded by Mel treatment. In addition, Mel inhibited the expression of PANoptotic key proteins, as well as AIM2 expression, in IP neurons. In summary, multimodal MRI enables dynamic monitoring of IP after CIRI in vivo and effectively evaluates the neuroprotective effects of Mel on IP. Mel broadens the time window for CIRI rescue and exerts a neuroprotective effect by downregulating AIM2 expression in neurons, thereby suppressing PANoptotic neuronal death in the IP areas and alleviating brain injury in rats with CIRI.",

Some 50% of anal cancers are diagnosed at the localized stage, 29% as locoregional disease, and 12% as metastatic disease. When clinical suspicion of anal cancer exists, histological confirmation, correct local staging with MRI and distant staging with thoraco-abdominal CT, and management by a multidisciplinary team are mandatory. Chemoradiotherapy with 5-FU and mitomycin C (MMC) is the standard of care for early and locally advanced disease, while combination chemotherapy with a platinum-containing compound and taxanes is the treatment of choice for metastatic disease.",

Currently, ROs derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been shown to mimic both the structure and function of the human retina. Furthermore, ROs function as a powerful model system for researchers, facilitating the investigation of the pathogenesis and treatment strategies of retinal diseases. Despite their development for over a decade, ROs remain limited in terms of complexity and clinical application. This review summarizes recent advances in the development of retinal differentiation methods and underscores their potential applications in disease modeling, gene therapy, cell transplantation, and drug screening. In addition, it proposes research directions that are geared towards advancing RO methodologies to further broaden their applications.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Gassericins K7 are heterodimeric bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus paragasseri K7. Their biological characterisation has been limited by challenges in obtaining these compounds in sufficient purity and quantity. In this study, we used a preparative isolation and purification workflow for gassericins K7, combining ammonium sulphate precipitation, Amberlite XAD-16 extraction, and reversed-phase chromatography. Mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of all four peptide components GasK7A α, GasK7A β, GasK7B α, and GasK7B β in the pooled preparation, including GasK7A β, identified here for the first time in natural isolates of this strain. The purified bacteriocin preparation exhibited strong antibacterial activity against indicator strain Latilactobacillus sakei NCDO 2714. Cytotoxicity testing in RAW 264.7 macrophages revealed minimal effects at concentrations up to 50 µg/ml, with only a modest reduction in cell viability observed at 100 µg/ml. Subsequent evaluation of immunomodulatory properties demonstrated a clear dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Treatment with gassericins K7 reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, downregulated inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression, and suppressed secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-6. Importantly, exposure of macrophages to gassericins alone did not elicit any inflammatory response. These findings provide the first evidence of anti-inflammatory activity of purified gassericins K7 in eukaryotic immune cells and highlight their potential as postbiotic components or biotherapeutic candidates for inflammatory disorders. The preparative method used in this study enables the production of gassericins K7 in quantities sufficient for advanced in vitro and in vivo investigations, facilitating future development of bacteriocin-based therapeutics.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were performed using Steam Exploded Sugarcane Bagasse (SESB), Hydrothermal Sugarcane Bagasse (HSB), and Hydrothermal Sugarcane Straw (HSS) biomasses. The study evaluated the energy efficiency based on glucose conversion and energy consumption throughout the process. The enzymatic hydrolysis experiments were performed in a 3 L stirred tank reactor equipped with two elephant ear impellers under the following conditions: 10% (m v −1 ) pretreated biomass, enzyme load of 10 FPU g substrate −1 , pH 4.8, 50 °C and 470 rpm for 96 h. Energy consumption was determined experimentally using a dynamometer and monitored throughout the reaction. Rheological data were obtained with a digital rheometer during hydrolysis. Samples were taken at predetermined intervals for glucose analysis and to obtain rheological data. The glucose concentration (C G ) at 96 h were 35.9 g L −1 (SESB), 45.4 g L −1 (HSB), and 49.8 g L −1 (HSS). The energy efficiencies (kg glucose kWh −1 ) obtained were 0.40 (SESB), 0.27 (HSB) and 0.28 (HSS). The energy efficiency with SESB was 41% and 46% higher than the experiments with HSS and HSB, respectively. The results of this study indicate that energy consumption during enzymatic hydrolysis is a critical factor influencing the process efficiency and viability. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This commentary responds to a recently published comprehensive framework for integrating mindfulness into global public health by evaluating its application to war-affected populations, with primary focus on the context of the Russian-Ukrainian war and Ukrainian populations. While Oman’s framework provides a valuable foundation for the integration of mindfulness within public health systems, we argue that it requires further development to adequately address the complex needs of combat veterans, volunteers, and civilians experiencing ongoing warfare. Drawing on recent developments in posttraumatic growth research and cognitive behavioral therapy, we propose enhancements to mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) that incorporate interpersonal emotional connections called \"attraction relationships\"-encompassing companionship, friendship, romantic bonds, and family ties and nature-based activation as critical components. We further identify limitations of existing assessment tools and outline directions for culturally adapted interventions that more accurately reflect the lived realities of war in Ukrainian contexts. This commentary expands Oman’s framework by integrating interpersonal and environmental dimensions into trauma recovery. We identify “attraction relationships” as a significant socio-attentional environment (Axis A8) and a crucial meso-level structure (Axis A7). We argue that for war-affected populations, the restorative environment is no longer solely physical but may also be conditioned by interpersonal bonds that provide the social-ecological foundation for religious and spiritual factors (Axis A12) that foster posttraumatic growth.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), while effective in simulating car-following dynamics for autonomous vehicles (AVs), often produces excessive braking forces during traffic light stops, compromising passenger comfort and energy efficiency. This paper introduces the Blended Acceleration Model (BAM), a novel framework that integrates IDM’s acceleration dynamics with a virtual deceleration function regulated by a dynamic blend factor. BAM adaptively adjusts the deceleration phase based on real-time distance to the traffic light, ensuring smooth transitions between acceleration and braking to mitigate abrupt maneuvers. Tested in a single-traffic-light scenario with a 100 m detection range, BAM combines IDM’s responsiveness with a gradient-based deceleration strategy inspired by stepwise velocity control in automated guided vehicles. The blend threshold factor (α = 10) optimally balances comfort and performance, maintaining deceleration within the comfortable range (≤ 1.5 m/s²) at typical urban speeds (≤ 60 km/h). Simulation results show that BAM achieves a 24.6% reduction in peak deceleration and a 30.6% shorter stopping time compared to IDM, while maintaining well-damped, monotonic deceleration without oscillations. Jerk profiles remain smooth and stable, with temporary peaks occurring only during final braking phases and within acceptable comfort limits. Compared to IDM and the Optimal Velocity Model (OVM), BAM delivers superior braking comfort, smoothness, and stopping accuracy, while OVM, though quicker, induces harsher braking. By addressing IDM’s rigidity in deterministic stopping scenarios, BAM enhances both passenger comfort and operational efficiency, offering strong potential for integration into urban AV control systems.",

The 3% propolis treatment significantly inhibited microbial growth, with total psychrotrophic aerobic bacteria counts of 1.47 log cfu/g compared to 7.04 log cfu/g in the control. Additionally, propolis delayed lipid oxidation, as indicated by lower thiobarbituric acid (TBA) values, and helped maintain the freshness and color of the samples. These findings suggest that 3% ethanolic propolis extract is an effective natural preservative for extending the shelf-life and improving the quality of refrigerated anchovy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Prosocial behaviours have been extensively studied across multiple disciplines. Cooperation, requiring a personal cost for collective benefits, is widespread in nature and human society, having been explained through mechanisms such as kin selection, direct and indirect reciprocity, and network reciprocity. Institutional incentives, which reward cooperation and punish anti-social behaviour, offer a promising approach to promoting cooperation in groups of self-interested individuals. Focusing on general $$2\\times 2$$ games and the collective risk game (a fundamental model for climate action), we analyse the associated cost of providing incentives under evolutionary dynamics governed by Fermi’s rule. Moreover, we explore the asymptotic behaviour of the incentive cost functions in the limits of neutral drift and strong selection. We also implement numerical simulations to study how parameters such as the intensity of selection affect the behaviour of the aforementioned cost functions.",

This scoping review systematically examined global approaches to identifying and evaluating potential OECMs. Analysing 99 studies covering 694 case studies and 237 000 potential sites, we found that potential OECMs are widespread, particularly in Asia and terrestrial environments, with most initiatives led by the environmental sector. Assessments relied largely on qualitative expert knowledge, with limited application of analytical methods. Although CBD criteria were commonly applied, contributions of related to ecosystem services and socio-cultural values were often overlooked. Effectiveness evaluations showed considerable uncertainty, with over one-third of case studies reporting inadequate evidence of conservation outcomes. The review emphasises the need for standardised assessment methodologies, improved decision-support tools, and socio-cultural integration to enhance OECM recognition, particularly under the 30 × 30 conservation biodiversity target.",

    "Abstract": "In the current study, polysaccharides (APS) extracted from the dried roots of Astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) Bge. var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao were demonstrated to promote hair regeneration. However, with an average molecular weight of 20,000, they exhibit poor transdermal absorption. To enhance local efficacy, we synthesized chemically crosslinked hyaluronic acid (cHA) and prepared γ-cyclodextrin-modified potassium metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) loaded with minoxidil (MDX) (MDX@MOF).The aforementioned materials were mixed with APS to form soluble microneedles (MDX@MOF-APS/cHA-MNs). Their oblique spike structure facilitates local fixation after skin penetration. MOF-based drug loading increased MDX water solubility by ninefold, while cHA provided significant sustained-release effects.Furthermore, APS enhances the mechanical properties of hydrogel microneedles and optimizes drug delivery. Notably, APS promotes human hair follicular papilla cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and exhibits synergistic effects with MDX. Concurrently, MDX@MOF-APS/cHA-MNs significantly prolong drug retention time in the skin, effectively improving hair coverage and growth rate in androgenetic alopecia mice. In summary, APS emerges as a clinical candidate for treating androgenetic alopecia, while novel microneedles with unique composition and structure enrich topical delivery strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Interest in drug repurposing has increased significantly in recent decades owing to its potential to accelerate the development of new medicinal products, provide new therapeutic options for patients, and generate business opportunities for pharmaceutical companies. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is defined as a chronic disease that causes an irreversible loss of lung function and premature death. Recent studies have highlighted the key role of mitochondria in lung homeostasis and the ability of thyroid hormones to promote mitochondrial activity, suggesting their potential involvment in IPF pathogenesis. In this work, we translate the findings derived from the above-mentioned researches into a dry powder drug delivery system intended to target epithelial lung cells with levothyroxine. To this end we developed nano-embedded respirable microparticles by spray drying a nanosuspension composed of levothyroxine and a hydrophilic polymer. The powder was characterized in terms of physico-chemical, toxicological and aerodynamic performance, as well as for its ability to be internalized by A549 cells and modulate their metabolic activity. The nano-embedded microparticulate drug delivery system proved to be potentially able not only to reach the deep lung but also to promote levothyroxine internalisation and mitochondria activation.",

In this study, we carried out a taxonomic study of the A. leucomelas and its relatives in Japan based on morphological and molecular analyses. The results revealed that “Nakajiro-shitaba” consists of two distinct species: A. leucomelas and A. limitaris (Walker) sp. rev. Therefore, we redescribe A. limitaris and provide diagnostic morphological and DNA barcode data for adults and larvae of the three Japanese Aedia species, i.e., A. leucomelas , A. limitaris , and A. kumamotonis (Matsumura). We also summarize their distribution and host plant information. Furthermore, our study clarified that A. leucomelas and A. limitaris occur sympatrically in Japan at least in some regions, and that larvae of A. limitaris can successfully feed and grow on the leaves of Ipomoea batatas same as A. leucomelas . These findings suggest that previous records of A. leucomelas in Japan may have included A. limitaris , consequently, re-examination of the distribution and life history of A. leucomelas and A. limitaris is required.",

    "Abstract": "Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) showed increased resistance to recommended therapeutic agents, including levofloxacin, ceftazidime, meropenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). BCC genospecies have different antibiogram patterns, so genospecies dynamics may affect overall susceptibility rates. This study analyzed the clinical epidemiology of BCC bloodstream infections (BSIs), assessed in vitro susceptibility of novel antibiotics, and explored prognostic factors for outcomes of BCC BSIs METHODS: We performed molecular identification to species level and antimicrobial susceptibility test to 12 antibiotics by the CLSI broth microdilution method. The 14-day mortality was used to evaluate the outcomes of BCC BSIs. Multivariate logistic regression was used for outcome analysis RESULTS: From January 2021 to December 2023, the study included 122 BCC isolates and 100 adult patients with evaluable clinical outcome. Among 122 isolates, we identified 97 isolates of B. cenocepacia, 14 of B. contaminans and 11 of non-cenocepacia and non-contaminans Burkholderia by recA or hisA analysis. Cefiderocol and ceftazidime/avibactam both showed potent activity across different genospecies. Aztreonam/avibactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam showed similar and even lower activity compared to ceftazidime and meropenem. Source control was associated with better survival (adjust odds ratio, 0.02; 95% CI 0.003-0.12). Neither regimens of antibiotic therapy nor genospecies was associated with 14-day survival CONCLUSIONS: The study highlighted the survival benefit of source control, instead of therapeutic regimens. Further, in vitro potency of cefiderocol and ceftazidime/avibactam may have a potential role to improve outcomes among patients with BCC BSIs.",

    "Abstract": "Pediatric myocarditis is a clinically diverse and often under-recognized inflammatory condition of the myocardium, with presentations that range from mild symptoms to acute heart failure. Advances in cardiac imaging, biomarker discovery, and molecular genetics have improved diagnostic precision and individualized care. Genetic studies indicate that 8-10% of pediatric patients with myocarditis carry pathogenic variants in cardiomyopathy-related genes, supporting the \"double-hit\" hypothesis where genetic predisposition interacts with viral or autoimmune triggers. This paradigm shift has underscored the relevance of precision medicine, emphasizing tailored management based on the underlying etiology and genetic background. While supportive care remains the foundation of therapy, including rest, hemodynamic monitoring, and guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure, pharmacologic strategies are evolving. Corticosteroids are under investigation for modulating inflammation, with mixed results showing improvements in ventricular function but unclear survival benefits. Immunomodulatory agents, such as intravenous immunoglobulin and other immunosuppressive therapies, offer promise in reducing myocardial fibrosis and injury. Virus-specific therapies are increasingly utilized in confirmed viral myocarditis, improving outcomes in selected cases. Recent studies highlight the potential role of biologic agents targeting inflammatory pathways, such as interferons, interleukin modulators, and micro-RNA-based therapy in refractory cases. Despite limited pediatric-specific trial data, extrapolation from adult myocarditis studies continues to inform treatment direction. Continued translational research and pediatric-focused clinical trials are critical to optimizing treatment of myocarditis and improving long-term cardiac outcomes. Future investigations should focus on refining immunomodulatory strategies, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and enhancing risk stratification to improve individualized care.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Optimising performance with a driver, fairway woods and long irons is a key focus for many golfers, with the primary goal of hitting the ball as far as possible while maintaining the ball in play. As such, recent years have seen a strong focus in the golf literature on how to maximise performance off the tee by investigating the factors that lead to the increase in clubhead speed (CHS). These factors include: (i) effective use of ground reaction force (GRF) during the swing and (ii) the path followed by the centre of pressure (CoP). Objectives The primary purpose of this systematic review was to investigate GRF and CoP within golf research and to identify what associations they have with CHS and skill level. Methods This systematic review followed the most recent Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines. In total, 129 studies where initially retrieved from SPORTDiscus, Medline and CINAHL databases, with studies meeting the inclusion criteria being subject to Newcastle–Ottawa’s quality assessment criteria (with a maximum score of 9 being possible). Results A total of 24 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review. Nine empirical investigations showed moderate-to-strong relationships between either: (i) CoP and CHS or (ii) GRF and CHS. In addition, more skilled golfers tended to exhibit higher GRF and superior CHS than less skilled golfers. From a quality assessment standpoint, all 24 studies scored either a 7 or 8. Conclusions Changes in both CoP and GRF represent important factors which contribute to superior golf performance, as defined by increases in CHS or reduced handicaps. Clearly defined methods for assessing force during the golf swing and universal terminology regarding GRF and CoP metrics are recommended for further research.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose of Review Kidney transplantation (KT) is a preferred treatment modality for most dialysis patients and is associated with better survival and quality of life. However, morbidity and mortality after transplant still exceed those of the healthy population, despite advancements in surgical techniques, post-operative management, immunosuppression, and patient surveillance. In this context, there is a growing interest in other factors that may influence graft and patient survival after KT, such as diet and other lifestyle factors. Among healthy diet patterns, the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) is most extensively studied in KT recipients (KTRs). In this review we have summarized the current data about MedDiet in kidney transplant recipients. Recent Findings Studies showed that in KTRs, MedDiet is associated with better lipid profile, low prevalence of metabolic syndrome, reduced oxidative stress, and better graft function, although the underlying mechanisms of these effects are not fully clarified in available studies. Studies are lacking or scarce regarding the association of MedDiet with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality rejection, hospitalization and infection complications. Knowledge of MedDiet is low both in patients and physicians, and available studies show low adherence to MedDiet. Summary: Preliminary studies showed that MedDiet is beneficial in KTRs with regard to kidney function and metabolic parameters. However, the relationship between MedDiet and other outcomes such as mortality, infections and cardiovascular events are lacking. More studies are needed to highlight these issues in KTRs.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The indoor cultivation of Matricaria chamomilla represents a promising strategy for optimizing medicinal plant production. This research evaluated the effects of LED spectral composition on the morphological and biochemical development of chamomile in an aeroponic system. Three light treatments were applied: Red predominant + Far-red + Blue (Rh + FR + B), Blue predominant + Red + Far-red (Bh + R + FR), and Red + Blue (R + B), with a photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 255.96 ± 5.8 µmol m −2 s −1 . Seedlings were germinated under controlled conditions and later transferred to an aeroponic system with mist irrigation. The treatment Bh + R + FR significantly enhanced flowering, increasing flower and bud production, floral head diameter, and petal length. In contrast, R + B promoted higher chlorophyll accumulation and nitrogen balance index, favoring greater leaf expansion, particularly in pinna length. Although anthocyanin and flavonoid concentrations increased over time in all treatments, their accumulation was not significantly affected by spectral composition. These findings highlight that optimizing chamomile flower production requires a higher proportion of blue light, while a balanced red-to-blue ratio is more effective for maximizing leaf development. This study provides new insights into spectral optimization for controlled M. chamomilla cultivation, supporting its application in the medicinal and aromatic plant industry.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Heavy metal contamination in Mediterranean riparian ecosystems presents serious risks to biodiversity and human health, requiring innovative biomonitoring methods for polluted watersheds. This study developed a comprehensive biomonitoring framework for an industrially impacted Mediterranean river basin, with approximately 100,000 tons of contaminated waste in landfills from decades of metallurgical processing. We investigated heavy metal bioaccumulation patterns in five taxonomically diverse native riparian species ( Equisetum arvense , Laurus nobilis , Rubus ulmifolius , Sambucus nigra , and Salix alba ) across contaminated and reference sites using Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence (TXRF) spectroscopy. TXRF was validated against Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Optical Spectroscopy (ICP-AOS) using standard reference materials, demonstrating superior sensitivity for trace element detection in plant matrices. Heavy metal concentrations varied significantly among species and sites in riparian vegetation, with Fe (23.14 ± 5.21 mg/kg), Mn (2.74 ± 0.89 mg/kg), and Cr (3.33 ± 1.12 mg/kg) showing the highest accumulation. Laurus nobilis appeared as a multi-metal hyperaccumulator with the highest Pollution Load Index (PLI = 2.67) and exceptional accumulation of Cr (14.74 mg/kg) and Fe (63.64 mg/kg). Statistical analysis (Kruskal-Wallis test, p &lt; 0.05) confirmed that Mn and Cr represented primary anthropogenic pollutants, with contaminated sites showing 2.20-fold and 1.92-fold increases, respectively. Principal Component Analysis revealed distinct co-accumulation networks, with Fe-Cr-Ni-Cu forming synchronized uptake mechanisms, while Mn operated independently. Biogeochemical ratio analyses (Fe/Zn, Cu/Mn) provided sensitive contamination indicators, detecting physiological stress beyond simple concentration measurements. Results support species-specific phytoremediation strategies aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals, with Laurus suitable for multi-metal extraction and Equisetum for Mn-specific remediation, advancing sustainable environmental management in industrially impacted Mediterranean watersheds.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Purpose of Review This review critically examines the role of furosemide and chlorothiazide in the prevention and management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We describe their common use, pharmacotherapeutic mechanisms, and summarize evidence from clinical trials and cohort studies evaluating their effects on diuresis and respiratory outcomes. Recent Findings Most evidence comes from studies in the 1980s that generalize poorly to contemporary neonatal care. However, a trial in 80 extremely preterm infants was published in 2025, reporting no certain effect of furosemide on death or BPD or on adverse effects other than electrolyte imbalances. The trial was not designed to address BPD prevention. Two recent large observational studies reported associations between greater diuretic exposure and lower risk of death or BPD but are limited by potential confounding. Earlier trials suggest diuretics may offer short-term improvements in urine output, pulmonary mechanics and gas exchange. Summary The role of diuretics in the prevention and management of BPD remains uncertain. While transient, modest improvements in diuresis and respiratory function are likely, existing evidence does not convincingly support either clinically meaningful benefit or harm. In the absence of robust evidence-based guidance, minimizing routine diuretic use and considering short-term, selective treatment with measurable individualized goals is prudent. Addressing the disconnect between widespread use and limited supporting evidence will require well-designed studies that consider optimal patient selection, timing, dosing and duration in the context of current diuretic practice patterns.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Multiphase flow through porous media is a common phenomenon during the processing of composite materials in which viscous liquid thermoset resin containing small bubbles due to entrapped air is injected into reinforcing porous fibrous media. The composite part is formed once the resin cures. Entrapped bubbles cause porosity, which is characteristic of materials fabricated by this technique and results in reduced mechanical properties. Hence, the reduction in porosity during the processing stage remains a critical issue. To investigate this, an experimental study was conducted to characterize the movement of bubbles within the pore network of the fabric’s weave architecture representing the porous media. Bubble dynamics, as the simulated resin impregnated the fibrous network, were observed in transparent molds for three fabric architectures, with bubble diameter and velocity being measured as they traversed through the fabric. A dimensionless number is introduced to correlate the fabric weave architecture to the bubble size, revealing that higher bubble mobility (indicating how fast the bubble moves compared to the pore averaged resin velocity) is observed in tighter weaves and with larger bubbles. To predict bubble mobility based on bubble size and fabric weave, two physics-based models are introduced. The predicted results are compared with the experimental data, facilitating void minimization by regulating bubble mobility.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Biochar and bioenergy crop cultivation with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) are two major negative emission technologies for carbon dioxide removal (CDR). However, biochar production is limited by biomass supply, while BECCS depends on costly CCS infrastructure and faces storage constraints. Here, a novel combination of biochar with biomass supply from dedicated bioenergy crops (BCBE) is proposed to overcome their respective limitations. Through retrofitting current biomass power plants in China with pyrolysis systems or CCS, biomass power plants are assumed to use either residues from agriculture and forestry or from dedicated bioenergy crops on abandoned croplands to meet their capacity for biochar production. Based on these plants, the CDR potential and the economic cost of BCBE are first investigated by considering different components in the life cycle of biochar, and are compared with an alternative scenario using bioenergy crops supply for BECCS. Locations for building new pyrolysis plants are then identified and the achievable CDR under biomass utilization scenarios is estimated. With 73% agricultural and half forestry residues or 84% bioenergy crops supplied to plants, the CDR potential of BCBE is 25.8 Tg CO 2 year −1 (95% CI: 23.6–32.4 Tg CO 2 year −1 ), comparable to that of biochar derived from agricultural and forestry residues (29.8 Tg CO 2 year −1 , 95% CI: 28.2–36.8 Tg CO 2 year −1 ). Despite the lower CDR potential of BCBE compared with BECCS, the cost of BCBE ($9.6 t −1 CO 2 ) is much lower than that of BECCS ($90.9 t −1 CO 2 ). With newly built pyrolysis plants supplied with bioenergy crops and agricultural and forestry residues, the maximum CDR of all biochar sources can reach 1880.4 Tg CO 2 year −1 . Thus, deploying biochar on a large scale with additional biomass supply from bioenergy crops is expected to contribute substantially to achieving China's carbon neutrality goal. However, critical uncertainties remain regarding plant retrofit feasibility, technology integration, and the biomass supply chain.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Biochar is a promising soil amendment for controlling plant diseases, but the influence of its particle size on disease suppression remains unclear. This study focused on the differential mechanisms of fine and coarse biochars in controlling pepper Phytophthora blight, linking biochar-released compounds (BRCs) to soil microbial disease suppression. The pot experiment revealed that fine biochar provided a stronger initial suppression of disease severity and pathogen abundance, but these effects diminished over time, whereas coarse biochar provided a more durable control effect. Similar time-dependent effects were observed for the increase in total and biocontrol microbial abundances. The mesh-bag experiment confirmed that fine biochar rapidly released minerals and labile organic carbon (LOC) in the early stage. This initial release significantly increased the abundances of total bacteria, total fungi, Pseudomonas , Trichoderma , and Penicillium , as well as the antagonist percentages of total bacteria and fungi, while suppressing Phytophthora capsici . However, the reduced release of BRCs in the later stage markedly weakened these effects. In contrast, coarse biochar provided more durable suppression through a slower, more sustained release of BRCs, resulting in a greater improvement in microbial properties during the later stage. Mantel tests and PLS-PM analysis indicated that electrical conductivity (representing minerals) and LOC were the key drivers that enhanced microbial abundance and antagonism, which in turn effectively suppressed the pathogen. This study reveals that biochar particle size influences the release rate of BRCs, resulting in a time-dependent control effect. These findings provide new insights into developing precise and sustainable disease control strategies. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving framework suitable for sensitive domains such as healthcare. This study aims to investigate how different types and intensities of anomalous data introduced by individual clients affect overall model performance in cross-silo FL environments. Additionally, it explores whether models analyzing gradient representations can detect such anomalies during training. We conduct systematic experiments injecting six types of anomalies at varying strengths into training data from two distinct datasets. Performance degradation is measured and statistically analyzed. Furthermore, we develop a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on clean gradient representations to detect deviations caused by anomalies. Our findings indicate that the impact of anomalies on model accuracy varies significantly across datasets and anomaly types. CIFAR-10 data shows higher sensitivity compared to the biological cellular data derived from Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI). The VAE-based gradient anomaly detection successfully identifies subtle shifts in gradient distributions, but effective differentiation is observed primarily for the QPI data. The results emphasize the importance of tailoring FL robustness and anomaly detection strategies to specific datasets and anomaly characteristics. Gradient-based detection methods show promise for enhancing FL security, but require further refinement. This work contributes critical insights for designing more reliable and secure FL systems, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Pre-hospital care plays a crucial role in the management and control of emergency patients and medical emergencies. The faster and more accurate the performance of medical emergency bases in terms of time and response, the lower the mortality rate, patient injuries, and burden on hospitals. This study aimed to evaluate the temporal indicators of pre-hospital emergencies in operational bases in Qazvin, Iran. Methods This is a cross-sectional study. The study population included all pre-hospital emergency missions recorded in 2021 at the pre-hospital emergency centers in the city of Qazvin. The inclusion criteria for the study were cases with completely and accurately documented information. After excluding missions that did not meet the inclusion criteria, a total of 7621 missions remained. A sample of 366 missions was randomly selected to initiate the study, and the required information, including demographic population, geographical service provision, service performance, and temporal indicators, was extracted from the ambulance base forms. Independent t-tests and ANOVA tests with a significance level of 0.05 were used to establish relationships between variables and compare temporal indicators in the two selected periods. Results The average delay time (1.833 min), response time (13.746 min), scene time (17.759 min), total time intervals (52.657 min), hospital transfer time (21.036 min), and total mission time (89.091 min) were obtained. The highest number of missions occurred in the summer season (27%), while the lowest number of missions (4.23%) occurred in the spring season. A statistical comparison between the first and second six-month periods of the year did not reveal any significant differences ( p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion The research findings indicate that the delay time and scene time indicators were desirable and within national standards. However, the response time indicator in this study exceeded the national standard and did not meet the acceptable level.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Accurate reconstruction of rock thermal history is prerequisite for understanding fundamental geological processes and assessing resource potential. Geothermometers provide critical constraints on the peak thermal exposure experienced by rocks or minerals during burial, diagenesis, or metamorphism. Conventional methods, such as vitrinite reflectance (VR) and fission-track (FT) thermochronology, yield valuable tem- perature data but are often constrained by time-intensive procedures, high resource consumption, and limitations in sample quantity or analytical spatial resolution. Micro-Fourier Transform Infrared (Micro-FTIR) Spectroscopy presents a viable alter- native for analyzing thermal alteration in geological media. This technique monitors infrared absorption changes in molecular bonds, revealing functional group transfor- mations that are acutely sensitive to thermal maturation and are effective proxies for reconstructing thermal history. This research optimizes an IR Geothermometer proto- col to address the intrinsic limitations of established techniques, thereby enhancing the precision of thermal event reconstruction. The methodology encompasses acid treatment for the isolation of organic components, Micro-FTIR analysis, and continuous heating experiments, resulting in broader sample compatibility and refined tempera- ture constraints. Methodological validation was performed by comparing IR-derived temperature estimates against VR data from coal samples and FT data from sedi- mentary and metamorphic rocks in Taiwan.The findings establish a robust empirical correlation between the observed IR thermal signatures and independent geothermo- metric controls, thereby confirming the technique’s efficacy for geological temperature history reconstruction. Utilizing the rapid spectral acquisition, high spatial resolu- tion, and capacity to register multiple thermal events inherent to IR spectroscopy, this technique offers an efficient, high-resolution methodology for thermal assessment in geological samples, with broad utility across resource exploration and petroleum geology.",

    "Abstract": "Leukemia treatment faces persistent challenges, including chemotherapy resistance and relapse, highlighting macrophage polarization in the tumor microenvironment (TME) as a therapeutic target. Macrophages dynamically shift between antitumor M1 and protumor M2 phenotypes, with M2-polarized tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) dominating leukemia TMEs. These cells secrete IL-10 and TGF-β, fostering immune evasion, angiogenesis, and leukemia stem cell (LSC) survival. In AML, M2 TAMs correlate with poor prognosis and chemoresistance via CSF-1/IL-10 signaling. Polarization is regulated by transcription factors (STAT6, PPARγ, KLF4), hypoxia, and metabolic reprogramming. Therapeutic strategies focus on: (1) M2 depletion (anti-CD163/CD206 antibodies); (2) Pathway inhibition (CCL2/CCR2 or IL-4/STAT6 blockade); (3) Metabolic modulation (glycolysis/OXPHOS targeting); and (4) Phagocytosis enhancement (CD47-SIRPα blockade, HDAC6 inhibition). Preclinical studies demonstrate CSF-1R inhibitors (e.g., pexidartinib) disrupt LSC-TAM crosstalk, while CAR-M therapy synergizes with phagocytosis-promoting agents. Despite challenges, macrophage-targeted therapies offer transformative potential by remodeling the TME, overcoming resistance, and augmenting immunotherapy.

The proposed framework integrates data-driven trial spaces with physics-based subdomain solvers, enabling scalable training and solution procedures for large-scale multiphysics systems. We establish convergence of the coupled method using previous results, demonstrate its performance on a suite of benchmark multiphysics problems, and provide a flexible computational infrastructure built on modern Python libraries for reproducible and extensible implementation.

    "Abstract": "Chronic sleep deprivation (CSD) is increasingly recognized as a contributor to gut dysbiosis, systemic inflammation, and neurobehavioral impairments via the gut-brain axis. γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing postbiotics, derived from microbial fermentation, offer potential in mitigating such dysfunctions. This study investigates the effects of GABA-producing postbiotics produced by Levilactobacillus brevis on CSD-induced gut and brain disturbances in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to 30 days of sleep fragmentation and treated with low (250 mg/kg) or high (500 mg/kg) doses of postbiotics. Behavioral tests revealed that GABA-producing postbiotics significantly alleviated anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Postbiotic treatment restored intestinal tight junction protein expression (ZO-1, Claudin-1), increased glutathione peroxidase activity, and reduced serum lipopolysaccharide and TNF-α levels, indicating improved intestinal barrier function and attenuated systemic inflammation. Postbiotic treatment promote the growth of beneficial genera such as Ruminococcus and Akkermansia, while also elevating fecal propanoic acid concentrations. In the brain, postbiotics upregulated blood-brain barrier (BBB) associated genes and reduced neuroinflammatory gene expression. Correlation analysis highlighted microbial signatures linked to short-chain fatty acids, intestinal tight junction proteins, serum LPS and TNF-α levels, as well as hypothalamic inflammatory, BBB gene expressions and anxiety. These findings suggest that GABA-producing postbiotics ameliorate CSD-induced gut-brain axis disruption by modulating the microbiota, restoring barrier functions, and suppressing systemic and neuroinflammation. This study supports the potential application of GABA-producing postbiotics as a dietary strategy to mitigate sleep loss-related physiological and behavioral impairments.",

    "Abstract": "Hypertension remains a leading global cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, with a significant proportion attributed to central nervous system (CNS) dysregulation. Emerging evidence implicates NADPH oxidases (Nox), particularly Nox2 and Nox4, as pivotal sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in brain regions critical for blood pressure control. This review explores the region-specific expression, activation mechanisms, and downstream effects of Nox isoforms within the CNS, focusing on the blood pressure regulatory brain regions, including paraventricular nucleus (PVN), rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), and circumventricular organs (CVOs). Nox-derived ROS disrupt redox homeostasis, impair baroreflex sensitivity, induce neuroinflammation, and enhance sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity. The interplay between Nox, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and mitochondrial ROS amplifies oxidative signaling and establishes a vicious cycle of neurovascular dysfunction. Furthermore, we will highlight the potential of Nox-targeted interventions and antioxidant therapies, emphasizing their therapeutic promise in attenuating neurogenic hypertension. A deeper understanding of CNS Nox signaling may pave the way for more effective and precise antihypertensive strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Unraveling complex mechanisms of telomere biology is central to understanding the close link between aging and inflammation. Telomeres are repetitive heterochromatin DNA structures at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, and their length is universally accepted as a marker of biological aging. Telomeres progressively shorten with every cell division until they ultimately trigger cellular senescence and apoptosis. Telomere shortening is also promoted by chronic inflammation and oxidative stress. Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress have been shown to be key drivers of age-related diseases, including neurodegeneration, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. Telomerase is central regulator at the intersection of genomic stability, mitochondrial function, epigenetic integrity, and proteostasis. Through its direct and indirect actions, telomerase modulates inflammatory pathways that drive aging and age-related diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target to mitigate inflammaging and extend healthspan.",

For non-native speakers of the language they will be teaching, the course is designed as well to strengthen their own pronunciation. A major component of the course will be hands-on working with L2 speakers, chosen by the student.\\nCourse objectives are as follows: Describe and accurately pronounce sounds from a variety of languages Transcribe sounds and words using the International Phonetic Alphabet Analyze data from a variety of languages to determine basic relationships: phonemic and allophonic relationships, and phonotactic patterns in syllables and words Describe the phonetic and phonological patterns of English, as well as other major languages as may suit the needs of the class Identify likely pronunciation issues between a given L1 and L2, based on differences in phonetic and phonological patterns. Be able to identify the source of pronunciation errors in the speech of actual L2 learners and propose linguistically-based pedagogical responses Employ a variety of linguistically-based strategies to help actual L2 learners master difficult sounds and sound patterns, in hands-on teaching. \\nThe inspiration for this course arose from grateful comments from students in my pronunciation classes, requests from non-native-speaking TESOL majors for help with their own pronunciation, comments from TESOL observers of my classes, and my observations of pronunciation textbooks and seminars designed for language teachers. A course such as this offered to language-teaching programs can raise the profile and perceived value of linguistics on a campus, along with providing key linguistic preparation to students preparing for careers in language teaching.\\nTo access PowerPoint slides for this presentation: Click the \"Download\" button on the upper right-hand side of the page.",

    "Abstract": "Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can directly detect surface analytes, enabling spatial mapping of metabolite synthesis and migration within tissues. However, MSI often lacks the sensitivity for routine analysis of low exposure, low molecular weight endogenous metabolites. Amine-containing metabolites, such as methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, lysine, dopamine, and 5-hydroxytryptamine, are widely used as medical biomarkers due to their potential biological activity or toxicity. Herein, we innovatively developed a universal in situ derivatization workflow combined with desorption electrospray ionization MS/MS (DESI-MS/MS) for mapping endogenous amine-containing metabolites, with trimethylamine (TMA) selected as a case study. For the first time, <i>tert</i>-butyl bromoacetate (TBBA) was used as an in situ derivatization reagent, which improved sensitivity and reproducibility by overcoming the strong matrix effect and signal instability of low molecular weight compounds in MS analysis. Our data suggested that the derivatization efficiency was affected by the alkalinity of the tissue surface, while spray/extraction solvent significantly affected the sensitivity for TMA-TBBA. Notably, DESI-MS/MS exhibited good linearity, reproducibility, and stability in the analysis of amine-containing metabolites derived from TBBA. The optimized workflow was utilized for the visual analysis of endogenous TMA distribution in the brain and serum of mice, revealing the enrichment characteristics of TMA in the cortex and hippocampus, as well as the severe accumulation of TMA in aged animals. Therefore, this targeted DESI-MS/MS-MSI approach, combined with in situ derivatization, offers novel avenues for the routine quantitation of intratissue amine-containing metabolites. In principle, this assay can be extended to a wide variety of metabolites in different biological samples.",

    "Abstract": "Aiming to meet the critical need for user-friendly and sensitive clinical analysis platforms, an all-in-capillary SERS analytical system integrated with a visible-light-enhanced nanozyme for highly sensitive and convenient biomarker detection was developed. The system employs a hierarchical tandem heterojunction (TiO<sub>2</sub>/MoS<sub>2</sub>/CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) as a peroxidase-like nanozyme, which significantly enhances separation and transfer of photogenerated charges under visible light. This nanozyme catalyzes the oxidation of leucocrystal violet to crystal violet, generating a characteristic Raman signal at 923 cm<sup>-1</sup>. To ensure analytical reliability, the inner wall of the capillary was modified with TiO<sub>2</sub> as an internal standard, enabling signal self-calibration. This integrated platform allows direct sampling of finger blood without any pretreatment, performing all-in-capillary SERS detection. The proposed method achieves ultrasensitive detection of Alzheimer's disease biomarker Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>, with a wide linear range of 1.0 × 10<sup>-3</sup> to 1.0 × 10<sup>-7</sup> μg/mL, a low detection limit of 0.089 pg/mL, and satisfactory recovery of 94.3%-101% in human serum. The method was successfully applied to clinical serum samples from Alzheimer's patients and controls of different groups, revealing statistically significant differences in Aβ<sub>1-42</sub> levels. Furthermore, the results showed excellent agreement with those obtained by the reference ELISA method, demonstrating high accuracy and practical applicability of our assay for early diagnosis and population screening. By combining rational nanozyme design with a miniaturized and calibration-free sampling interface, this work provides a streamlined bioanalytical strategy with great potential for point-of-care testing in early disease diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "DNA damage refers to chemical alterations in genomic DNA arising from endogenous or exogenous factors, and delineating the types and levels of these lesions is essential for elucidating the molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks underlying DNA repair. However, current methods are limited to one specific type of damage and often rely on DNA extraction and in vitro processing, which fails to capture the spatial distribution of diverse DNA damages within cellular context. Here we present intracellular strand break end extension-encoded amplification (ISBEA), an in situ imaging strategy that enables simultaneous visualization of multiple DNA lesion types. ISBEA uses a sequential enzymatic workflow in which glycosylases, endonucleases and exonucleases selectively recognize oxidized purines, AP sites and strand breaks, converting them stepwise into uniform 3'-hydroxyl termini. These activated termini undergo programmable extension and serve as primers to initiate DNA-encoded amplification, ultimately generating fluorescence signals present to each damage type. With spatially resolved visualization of diverse DNA damages within cells, ISBEA provides a robust platform for investigating the origins, repair pathways and biological consequences of DNA damage, offering valuable methodological support for advancing the understanding of genome stability maintenance and the development of related diseases.",

    "Abstract": "Targeted therapy enables the selective delivery of therapeutics to specific cells, reducing off-target effects and improving efficacy. HER2-targeted approaches are particularly effective in HER2-positive breast cancer. Here, we engineered protein nanoparticles based on <i>Aquifex aeolicus</i> lumazine synthase (AaLS) to simultaneously display HER2-binding nanobodies (aHER2Nb; A10 or 2Rb17C) and/or TRAIL on their surface. Both single- and dual-ligand AaLS protein nanoparticles retained an intact cage architecture and showed strong binding to HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Although SK-BR3 and MDA-MB-453 cells were resistant to soluble TRAIL, TRAIL-presenting AaLS (AaLS/TRAIL) markedly enhanced cytotoxicity by promoting death receptor clustering. Unexpectedly, dual-ligand AaLS protein nanoparticles (AaLS/TRAIL/A10 and AaLS/TRAIL/2Rb17C) exhibited biphasic cytotoxicity; low doses synergistically enhanced apoptosis in HER2-positive cells, whereas higher doses reduced efficacy, likely due to the activation of survival signaling. These results highlight the importance of dose optimization for maximizing the use of TRAIL-based targeted therapies.",

    "Abstract": "The occurrence and accumulation of novel perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have emerged as a scientific concern in recent years. While numerous studies have identified elevated concentrations of certain emerging PFAS, the sources and environmental accumulation differences of many homologues remain insufficiently characterized. In this study, we employed suspect and nontarget screening to characterize both legacy and emerging PFAS across environmental matrices, including water, sediment, and soil, surrounding an industrial park with predominant perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) contamination. A total of 32 classes comprising 112 compounds were identified, including 80 emerging PFAS detected through the screening approach. In addition to PFCAs, emerging PFAS, including perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs), perfluoroalkyl alcohols (PFAs), and PFA derivatives, were frequently detected in the study area, primarily in water and sediment samples. In contrast, the contamination profile was less complicated in soil samples, where PFCAs were the predominant homologues. The median total concentrations of target PFAS in water, sediment, and soil samples were 427 ng/L, 4.17 ng/g of dw, and 3.92 ng/g of dw, respectively. Predicted risk assessment further indicated that these emerging PFAS with high concentrations pose non-negligible risks to both ecological and human health, underscoring the need for further investigation into their potential impacts.",

    "Abstract": "Decarbonizing the iron and steel industry (ISI) reduces air pollutant emissions, yielding substantial public health cobenefits. Existing assessments fail to account for plant-level heterogeneity in production routes and geographic settings─critical determinants of health impacts─hindering the formulation of targeted decarbonization strategies that maximize health gains. Here, by integrating a facility-level emission inventory with inverse atmospheric modeling, we estimate that the Chinese ISI emits 1.56 Pg of CO<sub>2</sub> and 0.85 Tg of PM<sub>2.5</sub> annually, with 147,000 (IQR: 121,000-184,000) annual PM<sub>2.5</sub>-attributable premature deaths linked to ISI emissions, and the health burdens varying by 77,500-fold across individual plants. Blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) processes impose 3.8 times higher mortality intensity than electric arc furnaces (EAFs) (172 vs 45 deaths per 1000 Gg steel produced), with 80% of mortality concentrated in 21% of plants─predominantly large BF-BOF complexes in densely populated eastern China. Strategically relocating 30 Tg eastern BF-BOF capacity (3.6% of the national total) to scrap-based EAFs in low-carbon southwestern power grids could prevent 12,300 (IQR: 9500-16,100) annual deaths (8.4% reduction), generating USD 24.5 (IQR: 20.0-30.4) billion in combined climate-health benefits. Natural gas-based direct reduced iron-electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) integration offers a scrap-independent alternative, achieving ∼50% lower mortality than BF-BOF. These findings advance targeted strategies to optimize health outcomes during ISI decarbonization in China.",

    "Abstract": "Dimethyl selenide (DMSe) is the simplest volatile organoselenium compound that can undergo atmospheric oxidation to form secondary aerosols. While the oxidative potential of DMSe-derived aerosols has been shown to be greater compared to that of ambient aerosols from various sources, the role of selenium (Se) in processes governing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production remains unclear. Utilizing dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as a chemical analogue and mechanistic control of DMSe, we detected, quantified, and contrasted ROS produced by DMSe- and DMS-derived aerosols in aqueous solutions and confirmed the changes in Se oxidation state after dissolution. DMSe- and DMS-derived aerosols produced 9.0 ± 2.1 nmol ·OH/μg-aerosol and 0.29 nmol ± 0.11 ·OH/μg-aerosol, respectively. The average 33-fold difference in ·OH produced in these systems implies different dominating mechanisms of formation. DMS-derived aerosols can generate ·OH through organic hydroperoxide decomposition, whereas DMSe-derived aerosols are additionally capable of producing ·OH through Fenton-like reactions by cycling among Se(0), Se(IV), and Se(VI). Selenate (SeO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), selenite (SeO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>), selenium dioxide (SeO<sub>2</sub>), and methane seleninic acid (CH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Se) were redox-active compounds confirmed within DMSe-derived aerosols. This study highlights the redox cycling of particulate Se and the production of aqueous ·OH, which have important implications for atmospheric aqueous chemistry and Se biogeochemical cycles.",

Recently, the biosynthesis of MCCAs exhibits huge potential for sustainable development in both economic and environmental aspects. However, the biological method is still in its infancy and faces several challenges. A comprehensive review is therefore necessary to emphasize the recent progress in the production of biobased MCCAs. In this review, the principles of MCCA biosynthesis were introduced, and the main challenges were completely analyzed, including insufficient electron donors, byproduct accumulation, substrate competitiveness, and inhibitory factors. Moreover, several effective strategies that could improve the performance of MCCA synthesis were discussed, such as process control, biofilm, quorum sensing, electro-fermentation, bioaugmentation, and MCCA extraction. Finally, the potential of bioconversion of wasted biomass into MCCAs was analyzed toward the low-cost production of MCCAs.",

    "Abstract": "Rice lesion mimic mutants (LMMs) spontaneously form lesion-like symptoms without pathogen infection and are vital for studying plant immune and defense responses. Here, we identified an EMS-mutagenized Nipponbare-derived LMM, russet spots leaf (rsp), exhibiting leaf russet spots and deteriorated agronomic traits with significantly reduced grain yield. These abnormal phenotypes correlate with impaired photosynthetic efficiency, aberrant programmed cell death (PCD) and excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. Moreover, rsp shows enhanced resistance to bacterial blight and rice stripe virus, driven by altered defense-related genes and metabolites. Map-based cloning localized RSP (encoding MED subunit 33a), where a single nucleotide substitution causes its inactivation. This mutation alters plant responses to abiotic stresses and exogenous hormones, likely via disrupting its conserved domain mediating multiple biological processes. Our findings confirm RSP as a pivotal regulator of immune responses and grain yield, laying a theoretical foundation for breeding high-yield, high-quality and disease-resistant rice cultivars.",

However, the influence of redox-induced changes in soil components, particularly iron (Fe) (oxyhydr)oxides and organic matter (OM), on the mobility of these metals remains poorly understood. This study revealed that Fe redox cycling serves as the fundamental driving force controlling the release and immobilization of Ni, Cr, and Pb. Fe(III) reduction and OM complexation under anoxic conditions increased metal mobility, while Fe(II) oxidation and OM stabilization under oxic conditions reduced metal mobility. A kinetic model revealed that Ni and Pb mobility was predominantly controlled by Fe cycling, with Pb showing the strongest coupling (81.5-93.5% influence). For Cr, although Fe cycling remained the underlying driver, a greater proportion (82.6-83.6%) was associated with OM interactions. These findings advance risk assessment and inform redox-based remediation strategies for contaminated paddy soils.",

When expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>, MS2 VLPs efficiently encapsulate hpRNA, markedly enhancing its resistance to nuclease activity and environmental degradation. In addition, surface display of the HIV trans-activator of transcription (TAT) peptide on MS2 VLPs significantly improved cellular internalization of hpRNA, resulting in robust RNAi-mediated gene silencing in <i>H. cunea</i> at low hpRNA doses. Importantly, no adverse effects were detected in three nontarget organisms: <i>Clostera restitura</i>, <i>Plagiodera versicolora</i>, and the parasitoid <i>Chouioia cunea</i>.

In this study, Cd-containing whole wheat and polished rice were fed to mice, showing over 2-fold lower Cd accumulation in the liver and kidneys of wheat-fed mice compared to rice-fed mice. One contributor was higher iron, calcium, and zinc contents in wheat than in rice, leading to a lower expression of iron, calcium, and zinc transporters in the duodenum of wheat-fed mice. Additionally, fiber-rich wheat caused higher relative abundance of <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i>, strengthening intestinal integrity and tight junction expression, promoting fecal Cd excretion, and upregulating bile acid metabolism in the gut.

In addition, eight previously unknown vicine and convicine derivatives were identified. The bitter thresholds of the analytes were determined and found to be in the range of 0.10 to 1.44 mmol/L. To assess the taste contribution, the corresponding dose-overthreshold (DoT) factors were calculated, and it was shown that convicine with a DoT > 230 is playing a central role for the bitter off-taste. Furthermore, the analysis of fatty acids and their oxidation products suggests that linolenic-, linoleic-, and oleic acid directly contribute to the off-taste of fava bean protein. In addition, cell-based studies showed activation of bitter receptors TAS2R16 and TAS2R43 by vicine and convicine, respectively.",

    "Abstract": "Discovering novel molecules within the vast chemical space is a central scientific challenge, increasingly delegated to deep generative models. However, the prevailing \"black box\" paradigm, built on continuous latent spaces, faces a fundamental mismatch between smooth optimization landscapes and inherently discrete molecular structures, often limiting global exploration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Janus, a framework that recasts molecular design as a transparent, physics-inspired combinatorial optimization problem. At its core, Janus employs a Transformer-based autoencoder with a regularized binary bottleneck to map molecules into a compact discrete latent space. This representation enables the reformulation of molecular generation and optimization as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. This approach unlocks synergistic capabilities. For molecular generation, Janus leverages classical and quantum annealers to efficiently traverse the structured energy landscape, enabling the global discovery of diverse chemical scaffolds. Crucially, for molecular optimization, it moves beyond blind search by utilizing quantifiable feature interactions as machine-discovered SAR rules. This allows for rational, interpretable optimization─selectively modifying latent bits to enhance properties. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods reveals that this approach achieves superior multiobjective performance while preserving scaffold integrity, avoiding the structural fragmentation common in heuristic baselines. We validate the feasibility of the workflow on a quantum annealer and demonstrate its efficacy in drug-like property optimization. By unifying powerful combinatorial exploration with deep model interpretability, Janus establishes a robust framework for rational, quantum-assisted molecular design.",

    "Abstract": "Fully dynamic sampling of host-guest inclusion remains difficult because conventional docking and conventional molecular dynamics simulations can sample inclusion, but crystal-like binding is typically stochastic and difficult to reproduce. Here, we introduce DFDD (Distance-Guided Fully Dynamic Docking), a cloud-ready implementation of the LB-PaCS-MD framework designed to capture inclusion processes via unbiased molecular dynamics in explicit solvent. DFDD automates system setup, parameter generation, iterative short-cycle MD sampling, and trajectory analysis within a single workflow that runs on Google Colab without any installation. Progress toward complexation is guided only by the host-guest center-of-mass distance, allowing force-free exploration of insertion pathways and enabling the recovery of both stable and transient binding modes. Using β-cyclodextrin as a representative host, DFDD reproduces experimentally observed inclusion geometries within minutes and reveals intermediate states along the insertion route. Optional coupling with pKaNET-Cloud enables pH-aware, stereochemically consistent ligand protonation states prior to simulation, supporting robust host-guest modeling. This Application Note provides a transparent and accessible platform for efficient host-guest complexation studies. The DFDD framework is publicly available at https://github.com/nyelidl/DFDD.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, we investigated the potential of diazaborine compounds for antibacterial drug development. Most promising diazaborines demonstrated activity against several Gram-negative pathogens including <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, <i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i>, and <i>Salmonella enterica</i> ser. Typhimurium. For a subset of diazaborines, we showed inhibitory activity against isolated FabI (enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase) enzyme aligning with antimicrobial activity, suggesting a mechanism of action via the FabI enzyme and providing early information on structure-activity relationships. Optimized diazaborine scaffold <b>11</b> features an amino group in a meta-relative position to the sulfonamide group and exhibited the most favorable bioactivity profile, showing MIC of 6.25 μM against <i>E. coli</i>, low cytotoxicity, and high stability in human plasma. Furthermore, diazaborine <b>11</b> had synergistic effect with colistin (FICI 0.25) and preliminary data show that it may rescue <i>Galleria mellonella</i> larvae from lethal <i>E. coli</i> infection at the therapeutic dose of 1.13 and 2.81 mg/kg, demonstrating efficacy similar to ciprofloxacin.",

    "Abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses significant clinical challenges, including high recurrence, mortality, and drug resistance, underscoring the urgent needs for novel targeted therapies. Lin28B, an RNA-binding protein frequently overexpressed in HCC, promotes tumor progression by enhancing oncogenic signaling pathways and inhibiting the maturation of tumor-suppressive let-7 family miRNAs. However, due to the lack of conventional small-molecule binding pockets, Lin28B has long been considered an undruggable target. In this study, a series of pre-let-7-PROTACs were constructed by conjugating pre-let-7 family miRNAs and E3 ligase ligands. Most pre-let-7-PROTACs achieved efficient and specific degradation of Lin28B and restored endogenous mature let-7 expression, thereby suppressing HCC cell proliferation and migration, promoting apoptosis, and enhancing chemosensitivity. In a Huh-7 xenograft tumor model, pre-let-7-PROTACs exhibited significant synergistic antitumor effects when combined with sorafenib (SFB). This study confirmed that pre-let-7-PROTACs reduce tumor stemness by degrading Lin28B, offering a promising therapeutic approach for HCC.",

    "Abstract": "Lipid membrane phase separation, which is a thermodynamic physical process, has attracted attention as a dynamic function of cellular interfaces. As membrane tension influences the phase separation of cellular membranes under isothermal conditions, it is essential to clarify the physicochemical mechanism involved. Living cells contain numerous macromolecules that can generate osmotic pressure across the membrane due to the semipermeable nature of the lipid bilayer. In this research, we examined how macromolecular surroundings and the transmembrane osmotic pressure influence membrane phase separation, utilizing model membranes like giant lipid vesicles. We generated osmotic pressure across the membrane using dextran (molecular weights 40,000 and 200,000) and polyethylene glycol (molecular weight 6,000) as model macromolecules. Microscopic observations represented the changes in the percentage of phase-separated vesicles and miscibility temperature caused by osmotic tension, indicating that macromolecular surroundings tend to suppress membrane phase separation, while macromolecular osmotic pressure across the membrane markedly induces phase separation. Lipid membrane phase separation can be regulated by the macromolecular concentration and osmotic pressure across the membrane. This finding offers new insights into the formation and regulation of membrane domains within the macromolecularly crowded environments of living cells.",

    "Abstract": "Molecular representations largely determine the learnability of quantum-chemical properties with machine learning. In order to find the most appropriate way to represent molecules in chemoinformatic studies, a comparative study of nine two-dimensional molecular fingerprints and three RDKit descriptor sets (PHYS, CONF, and PHCO) was conducted in terms of the prediction of five molecular properties by trained predictive machine learning models. The use of RDKit descriptor sets consistently yields more accurate results than hashed fingerprints across properties. Among fingerprints, Layered Fingerprint outperforms for global energy targets (<i>E</i><sub>tot</sub>, <i>E</i><sub>ee</sub>, <i>E</i><sub>xc</sub>), whereas ECFP6 demonstrates better performance for atom-localized (<i>E</i><sub>atom</sub>) and thermodynamic targets (<i>C</i><sub>p</sub>). We further evaluate how the choice of hash function used during fingerprint construction affects representation quality and identify that noncryptographic hashing preserves locality and leads to better and more consistent outcomes than cryptographic hashing (SHA-256). This work provides mechanistic insights into how different molecular representations encode structural and physicochemical information, highlighting the merits and limits of descriptors for learning quantum-chemical properties. This offers practical guidance for selecting molecular representations and hashing strategies in designing and establishing pipelines for the artificial intelligence study of chemistry.",

    "Abstract": "Fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC), as a key electrolyte component, has been extensively employed across diverse electrolyte systems owing to its excellent compatibility with different anode materials. However, its mechanistic role on the cathode side remains under debate due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the fluorine incorporation. Here, we demonstrate that lithium difluoro(oxalate)borate (LiDFOB) can effectively trigger the latent cathode-side functionality of FEC through a rationally designed dual-additive electrolyte. At the LiNi<sub>0.9</sub>Co<sub>0.05</sub>Mn<sub>0.05</sub>O<sub>2</sub> cathode, oxidative cleavage of LiDFOB generates BOF<sub>2</sub> intermediates that activate FEC and direct its decomposition toward LiF and B-O/B-F-rich inorganic species, constructing a compact and resilient cathode-electrolyte interphase (CEI). Simultaneously, the coupled reduction of FEC and DFOB<sup>-</sup> at the lithium metal anode yields a boron-rich, LiF-enriched solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that enhances interfacial compatibility and suppresses dendrite growth. These LiDFOB-enabled, FEC-mediated interfacial pathways significantly improve ion transport and durability, delivering 73.4% capacity retention of Li||NCM9055 full cells after 1000 cycles at 4.7 V, versus 55.1% for the base electrolyte.",

While numerous chemical proteomics methods exist for determining protein targets of drugs, each exhibits \"blind spots,\" necessitating complementary approaches. We introduce Above-Filter Digestion Proteomics (AFDIP), which monitors trypsin digestion rates that decrease at ligand-binding sites, while potentially increasing elsewhere. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that these changes relate to backbone flexibility. Using AFDIP, we identified targets of various drugs and metabolites, allowing two-dimensional analysis with the drug concentration as the second dimension. The method identifies binding sites within ≤10 Å of crystallography-determined locations with improved resolution (≤5 Å) for larger proteins. Compared with existing proteolysis approaches, AFDIP offers simpler sample preparation, deeper proteome analysis, and broader sequence coverage. AFDIP addresses the blind spots of current techniques and provides structural insights, enhancing the chemical proteomics toolkit.",

    "Abstract": "A novel melamine-derived quaternary ammonium salt corrosion inhibitor (Me-B) was synthesized using melamine and benzyl bromide as raw materials. Systematic evaluation of its corrosion inhibition performance for N80 carbon steel in a 15 wt % HCl solution was conducted via weight loss measurements and electrochemical techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that Me-B exhibits outstanding performance. At 363 K, the addition of 0.1 wt % Me-B significantly reduced the corrosion rate of N80 steel from 1,258.36 g·m<sup>-2</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup> to 19.75 g·m<sup>-2</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup>, corresponding to an inhibition efficiency of 98.4%. Even at elevated temperatures up to 383 K, Me-B retained measurable corrosion inhibition capability. Adsorption of Me-B on the N80 steel surface follows a mixed physical-chemical mechanism consistent with the Langmuir adsorption model, which elevates the energy barrier for corrosion reactions and impedes their progression. Theoretical calculations elucidated the inhibition mechanisms of both neutral Me-B and protonated Me-B (Me-BH<sup>+</sup>), revealing that Me-BH<sup>+</sup> possesses superior reactivity and enhanced adsorption affinity toward the metal surface compared to neutral Me-B. This facilitates the formation of a compact protective film that effectively blocks corrosive medium penetration, thereby mitigating acid-induced metal corrosion.",

In this study, the adsorption behavior and energy storage properties of R32, R1234yf, and their mixtures in MOF-5 were investigated using the grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) method. The adsorption characteristics and adsorption heat were revealed under different pressure, temperature, and composition conditions. In addition, the rationality of the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST) used in the present models was also verified. The study showed that the uptake of R32 was sensitive to both temperature and pressure while that of R1234yf was sensitive to pressure below 1000 kPa but insensitive in the range of 1000-6000 kPa and insensitive to temperature. During the adsorption of R32/R1234yf mixtures, the adsorption of R1234yf also exhibits a similar trend. The selective adsorption coefficient of MOF-5 for R32 in comparison to R1234yf decreased with an increase in temperature and increased with an increase in pressure.

A model was developed to simulate scratching with a single diamond abrasive particle in an aqueous H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> environment to systematically examine the effects of vibration amplitude and frequency on friction forces, surface chemical reactions, material removal, surface morphology, and crystal structure. The results revealed that ultrasonic vibrations significantly influenced the fluctuation characteristics of the friction forces. Specifically, the frequency primarily determined the period of these fluctuations, whereas the amplitude determined their magnitude. Increasing both the amplitude and frequency promoted the formation of oxidation bonds, with the amplitude having a more pronounced influence. Ultrasonic vibrations promoted oxidation by increasing the number of dangling bonds on the surface, resulting in more oxidation bonds. Additionally, higher amplitudes facilitated the removal of atoms from silicon carbide (SiC) substrate, whereas variations in frequency had a marginal impact on atomic displacement. Lower frequencies and smaller amplitudes reduce amorphization, thereby preserving the crystalline structure of the SiC surface. However, high-frequency vibrations improve surface smoothness by shortening the single-cycle interaction time. These findings provide theoretical insights into the fundamental mechanisms of ultrasonic vibration-assisted polishing, guiding its optimized application in precision processing of SiC materials.",

    "Abstract": "Ultrasonic excitation can increase the coal seam permeability to improve the CO<sub>2</sub> injection efficiency during the CO<sub>2</sub>-ECBM process, but it may also cause changes in the coal molecules. To investigate the effect of chemical change caused by ultrasonics on CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> competitive adsorption behavior, this paper constructs the pore wall molecular structure model based on the coal chemical structure test results. The molecular simulation results show that the CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption heat and adsorption density decreased with an increased pore size in single-component gas adsorption. The oxygen-containing structure slightly increased CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption heat by reducing the effective pore size. Compared with CH<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> had more significant adsorption characteristics. The CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption densities were more obviously affected by the effective pore size and dominant adsorption sites, respectively. In the gas competitive adsorption behavior, the energy probability density distribution curves showed that with increased CO<sub>2</sub> injection, part of CH<sub>4</sub> transferred from the low-energy to the high-energy region. During the CO<sub>2</sub> injection, the gas density in the pores gradually increased, making the interaction energy between CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> more significant, especially for small pores. The injection of CO<sub>2</sub> into large pores more effectively weakened the interaction energy between coal and CH<sub>4</sub>, weakening the CH<sub>4</sub> adsorption capacity. The oxygen-containing structure may inhibit the competitive adsorption behavior in small pores, and this effect gradually weakened or even reversed with the increase of pore size. Ultrasonic excitation reduced the oxygen-containing structure, which improved the competitive adsorption behavior in small pores.",

    "Abstract": "Solid dispersion is a widely adopted formulation strategy to enhance the solubility of water-insoluble drugs. However, the molecular-level structural determinants of stability and dissolution behavior remain poorly understood. This study integrates Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) technology with coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations to investigate the effects of preparation methods (melting vs solvent evaporation) and drug loadings (10%, 15%, 25%) on the microstructure and crystallinity of PXM-PEG solid dispersions. Deuterated PEG (d-PEG) is used in the SANS to enhance the scattering intensity in samples. The findings revealed that the lamellar thickness decreased significantly from 173.01 Å (pure d-PEG) to 44.12 Å (25% drug loading, melting method), while the <i>d</i>-spacing reduced from 71.13 to 36.65 Å, indicating a substantial disruption of the crystalline structure. Conversely, samples prepared by solvent evaporation maintained larger <i>d</i>-spacing (up to 93.27 Å at 10% drug loading) and more stable layer stacking (Nlayers ∼5.6), demonstrating higher structural order. The results indicate that the preparation method significantly influences the structural characteristics of the solid dispersions. The melting method yielded a higher amorphous content at low drug loadings, which is expected to improve drug solubility and bioavailability. In contrast, the solvent evaporation method tended to produce solid dispersions with higher crystallinity and uniform structures at higher drug loadings. SANS results indicated that samples prepared by the melting method exhibited higher disorder in the high-<i>q</i> region, while those prepared by the solvent evaporation method showed greater crystallinity. The CGMD simulations further elucidated the dynamic aggregation and structural formation of the drug and polymer molecules during the preparation process. In the melting simulations, drug and polymer molecules gradually aggregated into dense clusters, while in the solvent evaporation simulations, the aggregates grew larger and more asymmetrical as the solvent evaporated, ultimately forming ordered structures. The combined results from SANS and molecular dynamics simulations indicated the \"sandwich-like\" structure of PXM-PEG solid dispersions. The outcomes of this innovative approach have the potential to advance the development of solid dispersion formulations, enhance research and development efficiency, and pave the way for the industrial production of solid dispersions.",

    "Abstract": "Anti-CD38 antibodies (Abs) are promising immunotherapeutics for hematologic malignancies, but their efficacy in leukemias often requires pharmacologic upregulation of CD38. Immuno-PET provides a noninvasive strategy to evaluate such target modulation in vivo. Cysteine site-specific <sup>89</sup>Zr labeling of anti-CD38 Abs was performed using deferoxamine-maleimide. CD38-specific target binding was confirmed in three human myeloma and two leukemia cell lines. Total and surface expressed CD38 levels were assessed by Western blotting and flow cytometry. Immuno-PET imaging and biodistribution studies were conducted in murine leukemia models. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) was used to stimulate CD38 expression. Myeloma and MOLT4 leukemia cells showed variable baseline CD38, while HL60 cells exhibited negligible levels. All tumor cells demonstrated <sup>89</sup>Zr-OKT10 IgG and <sup>89</sup>Zr-daratumumab (Fc-silenced) binding that paralleled surface CD38 expression. ATRA upregulated CD38 in all tested cells, including a marked induction in HL60 cells, all accompanied by corresponding elevations in <sup>89</sup>Zr-CD38 Ab binding. On <sup>89</sup>Zr-OKT10 IgG PET, MOLT4 tumors showed high uptake that was reduced by 67.9% with unlabeled Ab, but HL60 tumors showed low uptake and high liver accumulation, limiting ATRA assessment. <sup>89</sup>Zr-daratumumab produced lower liver uptake and improved MOLT4 and HL60 tumor visualization; ATRA modestly increased MOLT4 tumor uptake and substantially enhanced HL60 tumor uptake from 8.0 ± 1.7 %ID/g to 14.7 ± 3.1 %ID/g (83.8% increase; <i>P</i> < 0.005). Mechanistic studies demonstrated ATRA-induced ERK1/2 activation in HL60 cells that was abolished by the MAPK inhibitor U0126; U0126 also suppressed CD38 induction and <sup>89</sup>Zr-CD38 Ab uptakes in all tested tumor cells. Furthermore, U0126 blocked ATRA-induced HL60 tumor <sup>89</sup>Zr-daratumumab uptake in vivo. Western blots and immunohistochemistry confirmed ATRA-induced HL60 tumor CD38 elevation, which was partly reversed by U0126. Thus, <sup>89</sup>Zr immuno-PET enables noninvasive monitoring of ATRA-driven CD38 upregulation via MAPK signaling and supports its potential utility for optimizing combination strategies in leukemias.",

    "Abstract": "Onychomycosis is a common fungal nail infection, causing nail thickening and discoloration. Tavaborole, a topical antifungal, has fewer side effects but requires long treatment periods and often results in low cure rates. In this study, we developed a Zn<sup>2+</sup>-driven tavaborole-adenosine (AT-Zn<sup>2+</sup>) hydrogel to improve its therapeutic effect. The hydrogel enhanced tavaborole's solubility, drug loading, and antifungal activity. Characterization by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed its successful synthesis and nanofiber structure. In vitro release tests showed that about 65% of tavaborole was released in PBS at pH 5.5 over 24 h, indicating pH-sensitive drug release for targeted therapy. Permeation studies using a bovine hoof model showed effective tavaborole penetration through keratinized tissues with a steady-state flux of 162 μg/cm<sup>2</sup>/h. The AT-Zn<sup>2+</sup> hydrogel demonstrated lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for <i>C. albicans</i> (0.00156 mM) and <i>A. fumigatus</i> (0.025 mM) compared to those of tavaborole alone. In a bovine onychomycosis model, the hydrogel showed stronger antifungal effects than the tavaborole solution. Cytotoxicity assays on RAW 264.7 cells indicated good biocompatibility with >85% cell viability. These findings suggest that the AT-Zn<sup>2+</sup> hydrogel holds significant potential as a clinically effective antifungal agent.",

    "Abstract": "Simultaneous mechanical mapping and high-resolution topographical characterization yield rich compositional information for materials and biomaterials. The off-resonance tapping (ORT) mode in atomic force microscopy (AFM) offers an effective means to achieve this dual functionality. Nevertheless, ORT mode suffers from substantial closed-loop delay and limited robustness, leading to low imaging speeds that hinder its application in studying dynamic specimens. To address these limitations, we developed an integral off-resonance tapping (I-ORT) mode that replaces conventional fixed-point sampling with integral sampling of the interaction curve above the baseline. This method mitigates unpredictable interference from probe-sample interactions while maintaining the same drive and sensing conditions. As a result, I-ORT increases the ORT scanning speed by at least 10-fold without compromising mechanical property characterization. This advancement provides enhanced support for high-end nanotechnological research.",

Here, we show that intrinsic disorder is the missing ingredient. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy measurements on Fe-intercalated 1<i>T</i>-TaS<sub>2</sub>, an electron-doped Mott insulator, reveal Mott regions nucleated at point defects and charge density wave domain boundaries. These defects act as local charge sinks; the resulting sharp chemical potential differences produce narrow Mott depletion plateaus. In contrast, the hole-doped 1<i>T</i>-TaS<sub>2</sub> layer of 4<i>Hb</i>-TaS<sub>2</sub> displays no incompressible regions in the vicinity of similar impurities. This contrasting behavior demonstrates that local disorder, which compensates for the doping effect, plays a key role in shaping the inhomogeneous electronic structure of doped Mott insulators.",

Given that recombinant humanized collagen type III (rhCol III) is considered a nonallergenic biomaterial and can help repair skin wound healing and activate tissue remodeling, the potential effect of rhCol III on palate mucosal wound healing was preliminarily evaluated <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> in this study. A mouse model of an oral palate wound was established, and rhCol III solutions were injected periwound, resulting in a significant acceleration in wound healing compared to the control groups. Histological evaluation showed that rhCol III promoted angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and cell proliferation. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that rhCol III could promote human gingival fibroblast (HGF) and human oral keratinocyte (HOK) proliferation, adhesion, and migration. To further explore the mechanism, RNA-sequencing analysis results showed that rhCol III could regulate the focal adhesion signaling pathway of HGFs. The expression of vinculin and phosphorylation of FAK (Tyr397 and Tyr576) in HGFs was upregulated with rhCol III treatment. In addition, inhibition of FAK phosphorylation could inhibit HGF migration. These results suggested that rhCol III promoted HGF migration by upregulating the focal adhesion signaling pathway. These findings suggest that the topical application of rhCol III is a promising treatment for oral soft tissue wounds with the potential for future clinical use.",

    "Abstract": "The human skin possesses the capability to detect thermal and mechanical stimuli simultaneously. Ingenious flexible sensors have been explored to mimic such functionalities by integrating multiple sensing elements or adopting multimodal sensing principles. However, the widespread application of these sensors has faced obstacles such as complicated manufacturing processes, signal mismatches between different components, and high power consumption. Here, we report a single-mode self-powered flexible sensor capable of simultaneously detecting both temperature and pressure stimuli through the seamless integration of complementary and compatible thermoelectric and triboelectric sensing mechanisms. The resulting hybrid thermoelectric-triboelectric sensor exhibits unique features that are difficult to achieve with existing approaches, including single-mode output (voltage signal only), significantly simplified operation (single-measurement device), ultralow power consumption, adaptive response behavior, and excellent discriminative capability for complex stimuli. Additionally, a deep learning regression model has been implemented to dispose of the single-mode signals, achieving an impressive accuracy of 94.7% in distinguishing contact objects. This work presents an innovative design that substantially simplifies both fabrication and operation while simultaneously enhancing the functionality and energy efficiency of next-generation flexible sensing systems.",

    "Abstract": "Bacterial infected wounds pose a serious threat to human health. Developing a novel strategy that integrates real-time infection monitoring with exceptional antibacterial performance is urgent for advancing wound management. Herein, a multifunctional hydrogel (CMCS-PA@Fe/MUG hydrogels) integrating real-time infection diagnosis and therapeutic intervention capabilities has been successfully developed through the formation of Schiff bases between CMCS and PA@Fe solutions with the addition of 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide (MUG). The detection of the bacterial presence is achieved by visually monitoring the blue fluorescence emitted from 4-methylumbelliferyl (4-MU), which is produced through the enzymatic hydrolysis of MUG by pathogen-specific enzymes. In addition, the tissue adhesion and self-healing properties of CMCS-PA@Fe/MUG hydrogels enable them to seamlessly adapt to the mechanical demands of skin movement and stretching. Moreover, the combined photothermal activity of PA@Fe and the intrinsic antibacterial capability of chitosan endow the hydrogel with a superior antibacterial performance. The <i>in vivo</i> experimental results demonstrate that the hydrogel could effectively diagnose the infection status of a wound in real time and promote wound healing. Therefore, this advanced hydrogel sensor provides an innovative solution for infected wound management through real-time infection monitoring and efficient antibacterial strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Ischemic stroke, a predominant cause of global mortality and disability, is characterized by a complex pathological cascade, following cerebral ischemia. Despite some progress in current conventional therapies and light-responsive nanosystems, there remains a lack of precise treatment strategies. Notably, the function of ion channels has attracted considerable attention due to its close association with the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Consequently, developing near-infrared (NIR)-responsive nanoplatforms for the targeted modulation of ion channels allows for a more precise treatment of ischemic stroke. Herein, a second NIR window (NIR-II) photothermal responsiveness nanoplatform (MNPs@Mi), camouflaged with a 4T1 cell membrane (CM) for targeted delivery, is designed to synergistically modulate microglial polarization and ion channel activity in the ischemic region. In a mouse model of distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO), this integrated nanoplatform significantly shifts microglial polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype, enhances neuronal survival, restores blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and improves motor functional recovery. Quantitative analyses reveal a 2.3-fold increase in NeuN-positive cells and a 51.1% reduction in intracerebral IgG extravasation compared to those in the injury model group. Overall, this biomimetic NIR-II-responsive nanoplatform provides a noninvasive, spatiotemporally precise strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke via the coordinated regulation of ion channels and microglial polarization.",

    "Abstract": "Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) under ambient conditions offers a promising route for ammonia synthesis, although it currently suffers from slow kinetics and competing hydrogen evolution. Transition metal nitrides (TMNs) enable efficient nitrogen activation via the Mars-van Krevelen mechanism; however, effectively suppressing nitrogen leaching under electrochemical conditions remains challenging. Here, we report a nanostructured ruthenium nitride (RuN) catalyst synthesized via magnetron sputtering, demonstrating its application for eNRR for the first time. Structural characterization confirms a zincblende-like RuN phase, while surface properties (i.e., roughness and wettability) are tuned by the deposition duration. The optimal catalyst achieved an ammonia yield of 3.0 × 10<sup>-10</sup> mol cm<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at -0.3 V vs RHE and a Faradaic efficiency of 6.1% at -0.1 V vs RHE in a 0.1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> KOH electrolyte, surpassing most reported ambient TMN catalysts. These findings underscore the promise of metal nitride-based electrocatalysts and provide insights into the rational design of next-generation catalysts for sustainable nitrogen fixation.",

Here, we constructed a hexagonal mesoporous silica (HMS)/PLGA composite microsphere scaffold (HP). Subsequently, we further developed a polydopamine (PDA)-modified version of HP (PHP) by applying a PDA coating to its surface. Compared with HP, PHP exhibited improved compressive strength and hydrophilicity while maintaining desirable porosity. In vitro, PHP promoted BMSCs proliferation and osteogenic differentiation, upregulated osteogenic gene expression, and induced macrophage polarization toward the M2 anti-inflammatory phenotype. In a rat calvarial defect model, PHP significantly enhanced bone regeneration, as confirmed by micro-CT and histological analyses, and maintained elevated expression of BMP-2 and VEGF to support osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Immunostaining further demonstrated increased CD163 and decreased iNOS expression, indicating an immunomodulatory effect. All materials showed favorable biocompatibility. This work integrated the surface functionalization of PDA with the structural features of HMS, demonstrating that the ternary composite scaffold achieved simultaneous regulation of the immune microenvironment and osteogenesis, providing a promising strategy for clinically translatable bone repair materials.",

    "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the limitations of traditional vaccine development models: these approaches rely excessively on pathogen-specific antigen design, feature lengthy development cycles, and struggle to address threats from rapidly mutating pathogens and emerging pathogens. Even before the pandemic, certain traditional vaccines (such as BCG) demonstrated \"cross-protection\" effects beyond their target diseases. The trained immunity (TRIM) theory offers a promising path to develop broad-spectrum, effective, and durable vaccines. This review summarizes core advances in TRIM within vaccinology, systematically outlining vaccine design strategies based on this concept for the first time. These strategies encompass vaccine-mediated cross-protection, methods to enhance vaccine potency and persistence, pathways to achieve broad-spectrum effects, and regulatory characteristics involving immune recognition, antigen delivery, safety, and tolerability. This study explores the synergistic effects and application prospects of TRIM adjuvants such as β-glucan and Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. The impact of transgenerational immune effects on offspring immune function provides a crucial direction for future research. It also highlights current limitations in studies regarding persistence, individual variability, and risks of excessive inflammation. Existing vaccines capable of inducing TRIM will inspire next-generation vaccine development. Innovative applications of this vaccine category can propel the advancement of trained immunity-based vaccines (TIbVs). This review proposes an innovative approach─the \"Vaccine Immunity Foundation Hypothesis.\" This lays the groundwork for designing next-generation vaccines and advancing the clinical translation of TRIM therapies, establishing a theoretical foundation for developing broad-spectrum, highly effective, durable, and safe immune protection strategies.",

Here, we present DeteRministic Evolution of Aptamers via a Microfluidic-integrated robotic platform (DREAMbot), an automated system engineered to execute multiround EXO-targeted aptamer selection with minimal human intervention. DREAMbot integrates a programmable pipetting robot with deterministic lateral displacement sorting and lipid-assisted magnetic isolation, enabling the automated purification and recovery of EXO-binding aptamers from cell-derived vesicles and molecular contaminants. This robotic-microfluidic workflow faithfully reproduces aptamer enrichment while substantially reducing hands-on burden compared to manual SELEX. Using cell-derived EXOs as targets, DREAMbot identified aptamers with nanomolar dissociation constants and high specificity toward GPC3-positive EXOs from both cultured cells and human serum. With its modular robotic-microfluidic architecture, DREAMbot provides a practical and accessible framework for automated aptamer discovery relevant to liquid biopsy applications.",

Here, we report the fabrication of single-crystal field-effect transistors from a 2D Ruddlesden-Popper GHP, (PEA)<sub>2</sub>GeI<sub>4</sub>. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal that its intrinsic charge transport is thermally activated (∂μ/∂<i>T</i> > 0), a hallmark of small polaron hopping, which stands in stark contrast to the band-like transport (∂μ/∂<i>T</i> < 0) of its tin-based analogue ((PEA)<sub>2</sub>SnI<sub>4</sub>). We provide direct spectroscopic evidence that this behavior is driven by exceptionally strong electron-phonon coupling in the GHP lattice. Critically, we validate this by demonstrating that rational cation engineering to suppress this coupling switches the transport mechanism back to the more efficient band-like regime, enhancing mobility by over an order of magnitude. This work not only identifies small polaron formation as the primary performance limit in GHPs but also demonstrates a clear strategy to overcome it, contributing to the rational design of high-performance, nontoxic perovskite optoelectronics.",

Here, we developed a substrate-directed nucleosomal DUB activity-based probe (SD-NucDUB-ABP) employing a disulfide-trapping mechanism. This probe features a 2,2'-dithiodipyridine-activated 2-mercaptoethyl modification on ubiquitinated histone isopeptide amide, enabling selective covalent capture of nucleosome-interacting DUBs via their catalytic cysteines while remaining resistant to hydrolysis. Using this strategy, we synthesized the H2AK15Ub<sup>AT</sup> nucleosome probe and applied it in the activity-based profiling of DUBs in nuclear lysates of DNA-damaged HeLa cells. Subsequent biochemical analyses confirmed USP3 as a bona fide DUB for H2AK15Ub nucleosomes. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) further delineated the spatial interaction network among USP3, Ub, and the nucleosome, providing mechanistic insights into H2AK15 deubiquitination. Furthermore, we extended this strategy to other nucleosomal ubiquitination sites (H2AK119Ub and H2BK120Ub), capturing their cognate DUBs (USP16 and Ubp10, respectively). The SD-NucDUB-ABP platform thus enables integrated proteomic discovery and mechanistic dissection of nucleosome-specific deubiquitination, providing a versatile chemical tool for epigenetic research at the intersection of chemical biology and chromatin biology.",

    "Abstract": "Understanding the spin and charge transfer (CT) process at the 2D semiconductor interface is of both fundamental and practical importance for photocatalysis and optoelectronics. However, experimentally resolving the interfacial CT dynamics with both species, temporal, and energy information remains challenging. Herein, we exploit the spin degree of freedom to directly visualize the formation and cooling of hot interlayer CT excitons at the 2D interface using spin-resolved ultrafast transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy. We reveal a universal two-stage exciton interfacial process: an initial ultrafast (∼0.1 ps) spin-conserved electron injection forming a weakly bound delocalized hot CT exciton with a hot electron in the accepting layer, followed by a slow hot electron intralayer cooling over hundreds of femtoseconds to yield a lowest-energy tightly bound CT exciton with a band-edge electron and hole. The markedly slower cooling relative to the transfer step indicates that the electron and hole at the 2D type II interface can maintain a transient loosely bound and delocalized phase, which can promote the long-range charge separation and light-to-charge conversion. Indeed, spin-resolved TA measurements on ternary heterostructures directly confirm the spin-conserved long-range electron transfer across multiple interfaces. This study establishes a unified picture of spin-dependent interfacial charge transfer and cooling at a 2D semiconductor interface and provides guiding principles in next-generation light-harvesting and photon-to-charge conversion devices.",

    "Abstract": "The electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO<sub>3</sub>RR) has garnered considerable interest as a highly promising route for value-added nitrate conversion. However, the efficiency of NO<sub>3</sub>RR is often limited by the inadequate supply of active hydrogen species (H*) and their preferential consumption via the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), both of which stem from the lack of precise management of H*. Herein, we report a rationally designed ternary catalyst Pt@ZIF@Cu to achieve precise control and targeted utilization of H*. The spatially separated Pt and Cu sites serve as independent centers for H* generation and consumption, respectively. A ZIF layer is introduced as a hydrogen buffer, facilitating the efficient migration of H* from Pt sites to Cu sites with a reduced energy barrier, which ultimately enhances the NO<sub>3</sub>RR performance on the Cu surface while simultaneously suppressing HER at the Pt sites. The ternary Pt@ZIF@Cu exhibits superior NO<sub>3</sub>RR performance with an ammonia yield rate of up to 4.6 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> mg<sub>cat</sub><sup>-1</sup> at -0.8 V (vs RHE) through meticulous H* management. Furthermore, it demonstrates enhanced performance (8.34 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> mg<sub>cat</sub><sup>-1</sup>) in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) under ampere-level current densities, and enables the convenient preparation of high-purity solid ammonium products via Ar-stripping.",

    "Abstract": "Prodrug strategies traditionally rely on masking polar functional groups of bioactive molecules with protecting units that can be removed by specific stimuli in biological settings. Here, we introduce an alternative uncaging approach that bypasses the need for heteroatom handles, based on reversible masking of aromatic C-H bonds with thianthrenium groups. Unmasking is triggered by low-energy photoredox activation, which generates aryl radicals that are rapidly reduced by endogenous bioreductants to restore the native C-H bond. Beyond establishing the feasibility of photoredox radical chemistry in living cells, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept application of this strategy for the modulation of activity of antifungal agents.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Environmental health studies frequently measure levels of harmful chemicals in people or personal spaces, and returning those individual levels is an ethical responsibility and important opportunity to teach people about chemical exposures and how to reduce them. Objective We sought to enhance meaningful report-back by quantitatively evaluating a personalized tutorial designed to support environmental health literacy about personal chemical exposures. Methods We developed a novel smartphone-based tutorial that used the Predict-Observe-Explain educational framework to increase understanding of personal results graphs and promote taking actions to lower exposure. We deployed the tutorial as part of report-back in the Illinois Kids Development Study and Chemicals in Our Bodies pregnancy cohorts, and we collected digital analytics on how participants ( n = 295) interacted with it. We tested the effect of the tutorial on participants’ accuracy at answering four graph-reading questions and examined differences by educational attainment and socioeconomic status. The tutorial prompted participants to select exposure sources that were relevant to them, and we calculated response frequencies of participants’ self-reported interest in taking related actions. Results A total of 92% of participants ( n = 270) completed the Predict and Observe phases of the tutorial. Among those participants, 70% ( n = 188) correctly answered all four graph-reading questions on their first attempt (without tutorial assistance), and success increased to 96% ( n = 258) after the tutorial provided feedback and participants could make a second attempt. Improvement was greatest among participants without a bachelor’s degree. Participants who answered the Explain phase ( n = 182) expressed high interest in trying new behaviors to reduce exposure. Significance While most participants understood their personal exposure graph without assistance, the tutorial successfully reduced differences in understanding by educational attainment. The tutorial was also effective at creating intentions to adopt health-protective behaviors. Scalable tools like this can support effective report-back in populations with all levels of environmental health literacy. Impact To help people at all educational levels learn about their chemical levels and how to reduce them, we developed a personalized tutorial for use in reporting back results in environmental exposure studies. Before tutorial assistance, participants without a bachelor’s degree had lower understanding of their personal results graphs. Tutorial assistance successfully reduced differences in understanding between those with and without a bachelor’s degree. In addition, the tutorial was effective at creating intentions to adopt health-protective behaviors based on personalized recommendations for each participant. This scalable digital tool supports understanding and action during report-back of chemical exposure results.",

    "Abstract": "Cardiovascular events occur 20 years earlier in Sub-Saharan Africa compared to Europe. The risk factors for atherosclerosis differ between population groups and according to age. We compared the main correlates of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT, an index of atherosclerosis) in young and older adults of African ancestry. Hemodynamic (central and peripheral arterial pressures) and metabolic factors (lipids, glucose, glycated haemoglobin), smoking status and carotid IMT were determined in 573 adult Africans. In young (age<35years, n = 181) and middle-aged (35-59years, n = 231) adults, carotid IMT was associated with hemodynamic and metabolic cardiovascular risk factors on bivariate analyses. In older (age≥60years, n = 161) adults only hemodynamic factors were associated with carotid IMT. After adjustments for confounders, lipids were not associated with carotid IMT at any adult age. Carotid IMT was independently associated with backward wave pressure (Pb, p = 0.001) and age (p = 0.006) in young adults; with hemodynamics (central systolic blood pressure, p = 0.003; Pb, p = 0.02), age (p = 0.0002), body mass index (BMI, p = 0.005) and heart rate (p = 0.007) in middle-aged adults; and with Pb (p < 0.0001), male sex (p = 0.03), and HR (p = 0.04) in older adults. Increased carotid IMT was related to Pb in young (odds ratio [OR] = 1.233, p = 0.0003) and older (OR = 1.086, p = 0.0059) adults, and BMI (OR = 1.089, p = 0.0005) in middle-aged adults. Improvements in predictive performance for detecting increased carotid IMT were shown with Pb in young (p = 0.0032) and older (p = 0.0031) adults, and with BMI (p = 0.0004) in middle-aged adults. In conclusion, in African adults in Sub-Saharan Africa, carotid IMT is associated with hemodynamic factors, but not lipids. Moreover, in young adults, carotid IMT is primarily associated with hemodynamic factors.",

    "Abstract": "Cancer metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related death. While organs such as the lung are hotspots for metastases, others -like skeletal muscle- remain rarely colonized, a phenomenon that remains poorly understood. In this study, we show that EO771 breast cancer cells proliferated robustly when co-cultured with MLg lung stromal cells, whereas their proliferation was restrained when maintained in direct contact with differentiated C2C12 skeletal muscle myotubes. Notably, these effects were not cell-type-specific, as similar results were obtained with 4T1 breast cancer cells and Sol8 myotubes. After two days of co-culture, both cancer and host cells (MLg and C2C12) exhibited distinct niche-specific transcriptional remodeling. Strikingly, the poorly proliferative EO771 cells co-cultured with C2C12 myotubes acquired a hypoxia-associated gene-expression signature despite normoxic conditions (~20% O₂), showing that muscle cells reprogram cancer cells into a hypoxic, anti-proliferative state. Under hypoxic conditions, we confirmed that the depletion of oxygen allows C2C12 cells to nearly abolish EO771 proliferation. Neither exogenous lactate, culture acidosis, their combination, altered glucose levels, nor conditioned medium could reproduce the suppressive environment created by C2C12 myotubes. In contrast, MLg cells induced minimal transcriptional changes in EO771 cells and were themselves broadly reprogrammed by the cancer cells. Moreover, hypoxia enhanced EO771 proliferation in MLg co-cultures, emphasizing the permissive nature of the MLg environment. Collectively, these findings uncover a unique, paradoxical, muscle-induced pseudo-hypoxic program that restricts cancer cell proliferation. They also highlight the need for caution in targeting hypoxia signaling in anti-metastatic therapies, as such interventions could weaken skeletal muscle's natural defense against tumor colonization.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The habenula is a small epithalamic structure composed of two distinct subregions, the medial (MHb) and lateral (LHb) habenula. It serves as a critical hub for integrating fronto-limbic and brainstem signals to regulate motivation, mood, and reward processing. Therefore, it is unsurprising that dysfunction of the habenula has been implicated in several mood disorders including major depressive disorder (MDD), a debilitating mood disorder marked by low mood and feelings of hopelessness. This review synthesizes recent advances in understanding the habenula’s neurocircuitry, molecular landscape, and role in MDD pathophysiology, while evaluating its potential as a therapeutic target. Specifically, emerging evidence highlights subregion-specific pathology. Indeed, in MDD and in animal models of depression, the MHb has been shown to exhibit marked downregulation of calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion 2 (CAPS2) and deficits in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-mediated signaling. While in the LHb, dysregulated expression profiles of inward-rectifying potassium channel Kir4.1, the β isoform of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKIIβ), protein phosphatase 2 A (PP2A), and small nucleolar RNA SNORA69 have been found in animal models of depression and MDD postmortem studies. Structural imaging and postmortem neurohistological studies in MDD patients have further revealed habenular volume changes, reduced neuronal cell counts, diminished cell area, and abnormal functional connectivity. As research unravels the habenula’s complexities, its potential in treating mood disorders grows increasingly salient, offering new avenues for intervention in mental health.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Single Prolonged Stress (SPS) is a widely used rodent model for investigating the consequences of acute traumatic stress, but outcomes in mice are often variable across strains and behavioral domains. Because corticosterone (CORT) release is a central feature of the stress response, we combined SPS with post-stress CORT administration (SPS + CORT) to capture this hormonal component and unmask latent phenotypes. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated 1 (HCN1) channels are highly expressed in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) hippocampus, where they regulate neuronal excitability. We previously demonstrated that acute CORT enhances hyperpolarization-activated current ( I h ) in vitro; here, we tested its in vivo contribution to stress-related behavioral and physiological outcomes. Male mice (8–9 weeks old) were exposed to SPS followed by vehicle or CORT. Behavioral assays—including the open field, Y-maze, and contextual fear conditioning—revealed that SPS + CORT mice displayed impaired spatial working memory and deficits in contextual recall and fear extinction, resembling core PTSD-like features. Whole-cell recordings from dCA1 neurons showed decreased input resistance, reduced action potential firing, and elevated I h , which were normalized by the HCN channel blocker ZD7288. Overexpression of HCN1 in SPS mice reproduced both behavioral and physiological phenotypes seen in SPS + CORT mice, whereas genetic deletion of HCN1 in SPS + CORT mice reduced I h and rescued the behavioral abnormalities. Together, these findings identify HCN1 channels as a critical mediator linking post-stress glucocorticoid signaling to maladaptive hippocampal plasticity and PTSD-like outcomes.",

    "Abstract": "The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is a principal target for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in treating major depressive disorder, with therapeutic effects thought to be mediated by its connectivity with the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. As both regions are involved in autonomic regulation, short-term heart rate changes following DLPFC stimulation may serve as physiological markers to identify stimulation targets. We employed neuro-cardiac guided TMS in a cohort of healthy participants to examine the effects of stimulation intensity and DLPFC target specificity on heart-brain coupling (HBC). We used generalized additive models to assess nonlinear effects of stimulation intensity and target location on HBC, while accounting for pain ratings and other side effects. Intra-subject repeatability across three sessions was evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients. We observed a non-linear modulation of HBC depending on stimulation intensity and target location, with greater effects at the F3 lateral and F3 posterior targets compared to sham. By evaluating these effects across sessions within participants, we demonstrate the robustness of our results beyond the influence of pain and other side effects on HBC modulation. Exploratory analyses of the directionality show a consistent decrease in HR only at the F3 lateral target with suprathreshold stimulation. These results demonstrate that HBC is modulated in a target- and intensity-specific manner, with particularly consistent effects at F3 lateral sites within the DLPFC. The findings enhance the understanding of TMS-modulated heart-brain interactions, offering a potential framework for optimizing individualized rTMS treatment protocols for depression.",

    "Abstract": "Epidemiological research suggests that maternal immune activation (MIA) during early gestation is a significant risk factor for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders in offspring. Epigenetic factors and chromatin-related phenomena remain highly dynamic throughout prenatal and early postnatal development, offering a substrate through which environmental insults can exert lasting effects on gene regulation. Here, we used a mouse MIA model induced by infection with a mouse-adapted influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) virus to investigate the long-term molecular consequences of maternal infection on adult offspring. To separately assess prenatal and postnatal effects of MIA, we cross-fostered half of the pups from each influenza-infected or mock-treated dam at birth. We then profiled histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K4me3) and transcriptome changes in neuronal nuclei isolated from the frontal cortex of adult offspring. Our results revealed considerable overlap between the prenatal and postnatal effects of MIA on enhancer activity, suggesting a sustained regulatory trajectory across developmental stages. Prenatal MIA was specifically associated with changes in gene regulatory elements related to forebrain and telencephalon development, while postnatal MIA primarily affected pathways involved in axonogenesis and synapse organization. Cross-species enrichment analysis further revealed that MIA-responsive enhancers and promoters are significantly enriched at GWAS loci for neuropsychiatric disorders. Together, these findings support a model in which MIA contributes to disease risk through enduring epigenetic reprogramming of gene regulatory networks in the developing brain.",

    "Abstract": "Gemcitabine-based chemotherapy remains the standard first-line treatment for cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), but acquired resistance presents a significant clinical challenge. Synthetic lethality approaches targeting double-strand break repair (DSBR) pathways offer promising therapeutic opportunities. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, a central regulator of homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), is critical for maintaining genomic integrity following DNA damage. Here, we demonstrate that combining the ATM inhibitor AZD0156 with DNA-damaging agents (cisplatin or photon irradiation) significantly enhances cytotoxicity in gemcitabine-resistant intrahepatic CCA sublines (GR-iCCAs) while sparing gemcitabine-sensitive parental cells. This selective sensitization manifests in impaired colony formation, increased apoptosis, and persistent γ-H2AX nuclear accumulation. The magnitude of AZD0156 sensitization in GR cells substantially exceeds additive expectations, strongly suggesting synergistic interaction. Genetic ATM depletion in GR-iCCAs under genotoxic stress recapitulated these effects, confirming on-target specificity. Mechanistically, GR-iCCAs exhibit significantly reduced DNA ligase I (LIG1) expression, a critical component of the alternative NHEJ (alt-NHEJ) repair pathway, particularly under DNA damage conditions. Genetic restoration of LIG1 expression reversed AZD0156 sensitivity, establishing LIG1 deficiency as a key determinant modulating DNA repair pathway dependency. In xenograft models, AZD0156 combined with cisplatin substantially suppressed tumor growth compared to monotherapy, with acceptable tolerability profiles. These findings identify ATM inhibition as a promising strategy to overcome gemcitabine resistance in CCA, particularly in tumors with compromised alt-NHEJ repair capacity, providing a mechanistic rationale for clinical development of this combination therapy.",

    "Abstract": "The proneural-to-mesenchymal transition (PMT) is a pivotal process in glioblastoma (GBM), driving enhanced tumor aggressiveness, therapeutic resistance, and recurrence. HSPA5, a member of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family, plays a crucial role in regulating and maintaining protein stability and function. Although HSPA5 is a recognized marker of poor prognosis in glioma, its underlying mechanistic function remains poorly defined. Here, we demonstrated that HSPA5 expression is highest in the mesenchymal (MES) subtype of GBM. The overexpression of HSPA5 in proneural (PN) cells induced PMT and promoted malignant phenotypes, whereas its knockdown in MES cells suppressed PMT and attenuated tumorigenicity. We further established that HSPA5 drives PMT by activating the YAP/TAZ pathway in vitro and in vivo. The expression of MES markers CD44 and c-MET was transcriptionally regulated by YAP/TAZ. Mechanistically, HSPA5 interacts directly with YAP/TAZ, disrupting their association with β-TrCP. This protective interaction inhibits the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of YAP/TAZ. Furthermore, HSPA5 expression was positively correlated with YAP and TAZ levels across GBM subtypes. Patients with high expression of HSPA5, YAP, and TAZ exhibited significantly poorer overall survival. Collectively, our findings suggested that HSPA5 promotes PMT through the stabilization of YAP/TAZ and identified HSPA5 as a promising therapeutic target for GBM patients.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer is the predominant subtype of breast cancer, and its development is closely linked to metabolic reprogramming, including alterations in cholesterol metabolism. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the functional interplay between lysine demethylase 5B (KDM5B) and the Cullin-RING ligase 4B (CRL4B) complex in modulating cholesterol metabolism to promote ER+ breast cancer progression. Immunohistochemical assays and bioinformatic analysis of various cancer databases were performed to examine KDM5B expression levels in breast cancer. Additionally, KDM5B overexpression and knockdown were performed to investigate the role of KDM5B in breast cancer cell proliferation and progression. Notably, we identified physical and functional interactions between KDM5B and the CRL4B subunits, CUL4B and DDB1. Mechanistically, KDM5B recruits CRL4B to the promoters of INSIG1 and INSIG2, which are key regulators of cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake, and suppresses their expression by upregulating H2AK119ub1 and downregulating H3K4me3 histone marks, thereby promoting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of tumor cells. Functional assays revealed that disruption of the KDM5B–CRL4B axis impairs cholesterol homeostasis and inhibits tumor growth. KDM5B upregulation was significantly negatively correlated with the survival rates in various cancer types, including thyroid, lung, esophageal and colorectal cancers. Overall, these findings establish a novel regulatory axis in cholesterol metabolism, uncover potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in ER+ breast cancer, and suggest that targeting the KDM5B could provide a strategy to curb tumor progression.",

    "Abstract": "Vision is the primary sensory modality for many animals, especially humans and other primates. A fundamental constraint on visual resolution acuity is set by the size and spacing of cone photoreceptors, notably in the fovea of the retina where cones are the smallest. To optimally utilise this cone array, neurons in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) must have receptive field centres comprised of only one cone, yet such receptive fields have never been observed directly. Here we comprehensively map parafoveal LGN receptive fields in male macaques using an adaptive optics microstimulator and align them to the underlying cone mosaic. The receptive field centres of parvocellular LGN neurons were most often defined by signals originating from a single cone photoreceptor, a finding confirmed by biophysical light capture modelling and spatial frequency tuning data. Our results demonstrate that visual acuity originating at the fovea is mediated by LGN neurons working at the limit of cone photoreceptor spacing. Revealing this physiological basis of spatial resolution reconciles longstanding anatomical and perceptual data over what mechanism limits acuity prior to cortical processing, underscoring the centrality of optical correction for attaining peak visual resolving power.",

    "Abstract": "Many Gram-negative nosocomial pathogens rely on adhesive filaments, known as archaic chaperone-usher pili, to establish stress- and drug-resistant, multi-layered biofilms. Here, we uncover the mechanism by which these pili build three-dimensional (3D) biofilm architectures. In situ analyses of Acinetobacter baumannii biofilms using electron microscopy (EM) reveal an extensive network of ultrathin, flat stacks of archaic Csu pili interconnecting bacterial cells in 3D space. Cryo-EM structures of a single native pilus, pilus pairs, and two types of multi-pilus stacks show that the pili pack into antiparallel sheets, with their rods connected laterally by junctions at their zigzag corners. This antiparallel arrangement ensures that contacts form primarily between pili from interacting cells rather than pili from the same cell. With a remarkably short helical repeat, archaic chaperone-usher pili spontaneously establish a high density of junctions that determines the biofilm's 3D architecture. Our findings may help develop new therapies against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections by targeting pilus-pilus interactions.",

    "Abstract": "DNA replication is tightly regulated to ensure a single round of chromosome duplication per cell division. DNA licensing restricts origin firing to once-per-cell-cycle while aberrant licensing promotes re-replication and genome instability. Here, we investigate the mechanisms that protect genome integrity following re-replication induced by depletion of the licensing inhibitor Geminin. We find that re-replicating cells require FANCD2 to prevent genome instability. FANCD2 is rapidly recruited to chromatin upon Geminin loss, where it limits unrestrained fork progression and prevents single strand DNA gap accumulation and fork breakage. Genome-wide analyses reveal that upon re-replication, FANCD2 localizes to early origins within highly transcribed regions prone to accumulate R-loops and enriched in early replicating fragile sites. Importantly, reducing transcription and R-loops alleviates re-replication-induced genome fragility, whereas PARP inhibition exacerbates it. Our study uncovers a role for FANCD2 in safeguarding genome integrity during re-replication, offering avenues for selective targeting of cancer cells.",

    "Abstract": "The endothelin receptor antagonist atrasentan improved kidney outcomes in the SONAR trial for type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (NCT01858532), though individual responses varied. To identify molecular biomarkers of atrasentan response and outcome, we conducted a nested case-control proteomics study (N = 180) within the SONAR trial population and identified urinary clusterin (uCLU) as the top candidate. Transcriptomic analyses of human kidney biopsies at tissue and single cell level from independent cohorts revealed higher CLU mRNA levels associated with worse kidney function and outcomes. An endothelin signaling activation score derived from pathway genes was reduced by atrasentan in mice with diabetic kidney disease. In the SONAR trial (N = 3,060) population, higher uCLU predicted worse outcomes, while atrasentan reduced uCLU by 42.6% over six weeks. Early uCLU changes independently predict improved kidney outcomes. In summary, uCLU is associated with kidney disease progression and response to atrasentan treatment, supporting its potential as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to target therapy.",

It is mostly performed in vitro, but recent advances have extended its use to live cells, nematodes, and 3D cultures. However, to the best of our knowledge, application in living mammalian tissues has not been accomplished. Here, we present the successful use of radical protein footprinting (RPF) in mammalian whole blood from wild-type and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice. Using persulfate photoactivated with the FOX Photolysis System, we achieve effective protein labeling without significant disruption to blood cell morphology. An optimized quenching protocol eliminates background labeling. We report oxidative modifications for the eleven most abundant proteins detected, revealing disease-associated conformational changes in multiple proteins. We validate that in-blood RPF identifies changes in protein structure resulting from complement activation and increased transferrin iron saturation in T2DM mice. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of RPF in mammalian blood and create opportunities for structural proteomics in preclinical models and clinical samples.",

Recent work has revealed the role of sub-micron assemblies, or nanocondensates, in the organisation of a significant portion of the proteome. Here, we introduce a single particle fluorescence spectroscopy framework to visualise and quantify individual nanocondensates in real time. Using the low-complexity domain of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) as a model system, we show that this approach recapitulates the protein's phase separation diagram across diverse conditions and reveals the rapid formation of TDP-43 nanoclusters at ten-fold lower concentrations than previously described. Fingerprinting of individual events provides quantitative measurements of size, density, and temporal evolution, while two-colours experiments capture dynamic exchange, coalescence and maturation into ThT-positive, amyloid-containing aggregates. Our results establish single particle detection as a quantitative tool for probing condensation formation, early liquid-liquid phase separation events and phase transition mechanisms in protein systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Characterizing the nonclassicality of quantum systems under minimal assumptions is an important challenge for quantum foundations and technology. Here we introduce a theory-independent method of process tomography and perform it on a superconducting qubit. We demonstrate its decoherence without assuming quantum theory or trusting the devices by modelling the system as a general probabilistic theory. We show that the superconducting system is initially well-described as a quantum bit, but that its realized state space contracts over time, which in quantum terminology indicates its loss of coherence. The system is initially nonclassical in the sense of generalized contextuality: it does not admit of a hidden-variable model where statistically indistinguishable preparations are represented by identical hidden-variable distributions. In finite time, the system becomes noncontextual and hence loses its nonclassicality. Moreover, we demonstrate in a theory-independent way that the system undergoes non-Markovian evolution at late times. Our results extend theory-independent tomography to time-evolving systems, and show how important dynamical physical phenomena can be experimentally monitored without assuming quantum theory.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract CRISPR/Cas9-based gene-editing technologies offer promise for treating inherited retinal diseases (IRDs), however safe and efficient ocular delivery of precision editors remains challenging. To address this challenge, we report a class of Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB)-derived lipidoids that bind and deliver proteins. Subretinal injection of Cre complexed with these lipidoids into mT/mG mice leads to robust recombination in the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. We employ the CBB-lipidoid platform to deliver adenine base editor (ABE) ribonucleoproteins (RNP). Incorporating CBB lipidoids into liposomes improves delivery efficiency. CBB11 stands out for facilitating precise in vivo ABE-mediated gene editing. Delivery of liposome-CBB11-RNP complexes results in a 120-fold increase in base editing compared to RNP alone and restores the scotopic ERG b-wave response in the rd12 mouse model. These results demonstrate the potential of CBB-augmented, liposome-RNP systems for therapeutic gene editing in the eye, paving the way for single-dose precision medicines to treat IRDs.",

However, comparisons across ionization modes have remained a substantial challenge due to the distinct fragmentation patterns produced by each polarity. To overcome this barrier, we present MS2DeepScore 2.0, a machine learning-based model to predict chemical similarity between mass fragmentation spectra, which works both between different and the same ionization modes. We demonstrate the utility of MS2DeepScore 2.0 in three case studies, where MS2DeepScore enabled cross-ionization mode molecular networking, enhancing data exploration and metabolite annotation. To ensure robustness, we have implemented a quality estimation method that flags spectra with low information content or those dissimilar to the training data, thereby minimizing false predictions. Altogether, MS2DeepScore 2.0 extends our current capabilities in organizing, exploring, and annotating untargeted metabolomics profiles.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In neuromorphic photonic systems, device operations are typically governed by analog signals, necessitating digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann architectures incur significant energy costs. We propose an analog electronic memory co-located with photonic computing units to eliminate repeated long-distance data movement. Here, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with on-chip capacitive analog memory and evaluate its performance in machine learning for in situ training and inference using the MNIST dataset. Our analysis shows that integrating analog memory into a neuromorphic photonic architecture can achieve over 26 × power savings compared to conventional SRAM-DAC architectures. Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains &gt;90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation. This approach reduces reliance on DACs, minimizes data movement, and offers a scalable pathway toward energy-efficient, high-speed neuromorphic photonic computing.",

    "Abstract": "Bacteriophage T4 has long served as an extraordinary model for tailed phages. During virion assembly, the viral DNA genome is tightly packed into the head, to which tail attaches via a portal-neck connector. Keeping this highly pressurized head leak-proof during these transactions is a challenge, yet the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that T4 seals its DNA-filled capsid using a double \"genome-gate\" mechanism. By reconstituting portal (gp20)-neck (gp13/gp14) assembly intermediates in vitro and determining their structures, we find that the gp14 hexamer forms a primary gate that closes the portal-neck opening. This gate is reinforced by a second gate formed by the host protein Hfq, which is hijacked by the virus as an accessory structural component. Hfq also stabilizes neck assembly and prevents its mis-assembly with portal. These studies define a viral genome retention mechanism in which a pre-assembled gp13/gp14/Hfq neck complex seals the pressurized, genome-filled capsid during virion maturation.",

    "Abstract": "Phage therapy is emerging as a promising alternative to antibiotics for treating various infections. However, there have been no prior studies on using bacteriophages for peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. This report presents the successful treatment of refractory peritonitis in a 71-year-old male peritoneal dialysis patient using bacteriophages combined with antibiotics. The patient has a history of refractory and repeat peritonitis caused by Staphylococcus haemolyticus, which was resolved through simultaneous catheter replacement (SCR). Subsequently, the patient experiences another episode of refractory peritonitis due to Klebsiella pneumoniae. Although this strain is found to be susceptible to amikacin and imipenem, a 14-day course of treatment with these antibiotics in the abdominal cavity fails to resolve the peritonitis. Combined with antibiotic therapy, the patient is successfully treated with intraperitoneal phage therapy targeting his bacterial isolate. We monitor the longitudinal progression of phage loads, phage-neutralizing antibodies, interleukin-6 levels, and lipopolysaccharide concentrations in the dialysate effluent during the bacteriophage therapy. The combination of a phage cocktail and imipenem (IPM) demonstrates a greater effect in killing bacteria than either treatment alone, which indicates that a synergistic effect exists between the phage cocktail and IPM. Intraperitoneal IPM is discontinued after a 3-week course of treatment. At the same time, oral fluconazole is given to prevent fungal infections. The patient is discharged without any antibiotics. After this round of treatment, the patient remains healthy during the one-month follow-up. Our study suggests that personalized phage therapy combined with sensitive antibiotics can play a significant role in managing refractory peritonitis in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, showing promise for future applications.",

Here, we report a cytochrome P450 enzyme, namely P450stri, from Streptomyces triculaminicus and its engineering as a peroxygenase with strong H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> tolerance for regioselective hydroxylation of steroids.

    "Abstract": "Cytokinesis critically depends on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>]. Synthesis of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is crucial for several stages of cytokinesis, including actomyosin ring assembly and constriction, membrane tethering of spindle microtubules, and midbody organization. How these activities of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> are spatiotemporally controlled is unknown. Here we unravel a crucial function for local PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> synthesis at the ingressed cleavage furrow by septin-binding isoforms of PIPKIγ to control midbody formation. We demonstrate that loss of PIPKIγ isoforms perturbs cytokinesis by impairing septin association with microtubules, and anillin and septin deposition at the intercellular bridge and at the midbody. This mechanism requires the ability of PIPKIγ isoforms to synthesize PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and to associate with septins. Septins and PIPKIγ further synergize to promote centralspindlin recruitment to the midbody. Our findings establish septin-associated PIPKIγ isoforms as spatiotemporal controllers of midbody organization during cytokinesis that act through generating a local pool of PI4,5P<sub>2</sub> at the ingressed cleavage furrow.",

Here, we show how in ancestral endosymbionts of planthoppers, Sulcia and Vidania , which have been gradually losing genes during ~263 my of co-diversification with hosts, co-infections by additional microbes and host ecological switches coincided with more dramatic genomic changes. At its extremes, this has resulted in the smallest non-organellar bacterial genomes known, at barely 50-52 kb. Such minuscule Vidania genomes evolved convergently in two planthopper superfamilies, and are strikingly similar in gene contents, including the ability to produce a single amino acid (phenylalanine) for the host. Losing many additional cell-function genes places them very close to organelles of symbiotic origin in the level of host dependence, further blurring the bacteria-organelle boundary.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) is a leading cause of mortality, driven by poorly defined molecular interactions within the hepatic niche. Here, we identify a distinct population of pro-metastatic Early Growth Response 1 (Egr1) + neutrophils that accumulate in the pre-metastatic liver. Mechanistically, we show that KIAA1199-high cancer cells secrete granulin-rich extracellular vesicles, which are internalized by hepatocytes. This uptake triggers a subset of functionally reprogrammed hepatocytes, characterized by a profound metabolic reprogramming and the suppression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling, leading to increased secretion of Serum Amyloid A2 (SAA2). Hepatocyte-derived SAA2 subsequently activates Formyl Peptide Receptor 2 (FPR2) on neutrophils, stabilizing Egr1-driven transcriptional program via the PI3K-AKT pathway to enhance neutrophil survival and pro-angiogenic activity. These Egr1 + neutrophils co-localize with reprogrammed hepatocytes at the tumor-liver interface, where they promote vascular remodeling to facilitate metastatic colonization. Pharmacological restoration of PPARγ or FPR2 inhibition abrogate CRLM in preclinical models in female mice. Furthermore, a combined KIAA1199-SAA2 signature predicts liver metastasis risk in patients. Our findings delineate a KIAA1199-PPARγ/SAA2-Egr1 axis orchestrating the pre-metastatic niche and propose metabolic normalization as a preventative strategy for liver metastasis.",

Biocatalysis could enable cheaper, greener, and more sustainable alternatives. However, known butenolide biosynthetic pathways are complex and challenging to harness. Here we show that avenolide, a 4-alkylbutenolide that regulates avermectin production in Streptomyces avermitilis, is assembled from a fatty acyl thioester by a multifunctional flavoenzyme and an iterative cytochrome P450. The flavoenzyme catalyzes homochiral 4-alkylbutenolide formation via successive desaturation, hydroxylation, and lactonization reactions, using dioxygen as the sole stoichiometric reagent.

We identify a clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA), harboring heterogeneous multicopy bla CTX-M , among which a bla CTX-M-249 variant mediates CZA resistance. Both bla CTX-M-249 and its closely related allele bla CTX-M-65 are dominant within the clonal population and are located at two loci on the same plasmid, with their proportions shifting under antibiotic pressure. Using experimental and mathematical models, we demonstrate that the heterogeneous arrangement of bla CTX-M variants on the same plasmid confers greater stability and competitive advantage than that across separate plasmids, particularly during drug switching. Re-analysis of large genomic datasets supports the universality of this phenomenon. Our findings reveal an evolutionary strategy in which β-lactamase genes, through multicopy heterogeneity on a single plasmid, ensure stable inheritance of resistance and enhance bacterial adaptability under fluctuating clinical antibiotic pressures.",

    "Abstract": "Spintronics has emerged as a revolutionary frontier in the pursuit of faster, more energy-efficient, and technologically advanced electronics. However, the transmission distance of conventional ferromagnetic spin-orbit torque is typically limited to <10 nm, posing a critical challenge for spin current transport. Here we grow Mn<sub>3</sub>Sn films with a 30° canted magnetic octupole moment oriented out of plane, in which the Kagome spin structure is fully perpendicular to the film surface. By introducing a spin-orbital coupled amorphous Pt overlayer, we demonstrate the electrical switching dynamics of magnetic octupoles in Kagome antiferromagnetic Mn<sub>3</sub>Sn. Remarkably, perpendicular spin currents reverse Mn<sub>3</sub>Sn layers up to 60 nm thick. The switching efficiency of Mn<sub>3</sub>Sn/Pt bilayers increases with antiferromagnetic thickness, peaking near 40 nm before decreasing, reflecting a long spin diffusion length sustained by twin topological spin structures. Direct observation of magnetic octupole dynamics further validates the presence of such twin spin orders. Moreover, our theoretical analysis reveals that twin topological spin canting intrinsically supports ultralong-distance octupole switching. These findings establish antiferromagnetic Mn<sub>3</sub>Sn as a robust platform for efficient spin transport and highlight the pronounced long-range nature of spin-orbit torque enabled by twin spin order.",

While the \"all-geometric\" approach has successfully enabled robust control of atoms, ions, and electrons in various quantum systems, its photonic implementations have remained limited by a lack of tunability-an essential feature for modern classical or quantum optical information processing. Here, we demonstrate nonvolatile multilevel tunable generic special-orthogonal (SO) geometric phases on a multilayer silicon photonic platform incorporating the phase-change material (PCM) of Sb₂Se₃. By toggling Sb₂Se₃ between crystalline and amorphous states, we dynamically control the number of degenerate states involved in the holonomy, enabling switching between different holonomic paths and SO(m) geometric transformations. Our results bridge the key gap between robust geometric-phase control and in-memory reconfigurable photonics, establishing a paradigm for fault-tolerant, high-dimensional operations in integrated optical systems.",

Although TH synthesis is well described in vertebrates, it remains elusive in invertebrates due to the lack of identified thyroglobulin (TG) orthologs, the protein precursor for TH synthesis. Here, we identified a functional TG-like protein in ascidian Styela clava via immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry combined with phylogenetic and expression analyses. In vitro iodination demonstrated that ScTG-like provides hormonogenic sites for TH synthesis. In vivo ScTg-like knockdown significantly reduced THs and inhibited larval metamorphosis. An invaginated follicle-like structure in the larval trunk, deposited with ScTG-like, was identified as the location for THs synthesis and storage. Furthermore, structural analysis of ScTG-like and predicted TG-like proteins across bilaterian phyla suggests that endogenous TH synthesis may be an ancestral and synapomorphic bilaterian trait. This study reports the identification of a TH precursor outside vertebrates, shedding lights on the evolution of the TH synthesis.",

Here, we show that different domains of Gpr126 distinctly regulate compact wall integrity and trabecular identity. Maternal zygotic (MZ) gpr126<sup>stl47</sup> early truncation mutants exhibit hypotrabeculation, whereby N-cadherin distributes randomly along apical/basal/lateral membranes of compact layer cardiomyocytes. In contrast, zygotic and MZ gpr126<sup>st49</sup> mutants, expressing a N-terminal fragment lacking the GPS motif (NTF<sup>ΔGPS</sup>), exhibit a multilayered ventricular wall containing polarized cardiomyocytes with normal N-cadherin localization and increased Notch activity. Notably, endocardially expressed gpr126 C-terminal fragment (CTF) reinstates trabeculation in gpr126<sup>st49</sup> mutants. Collectively, our data reveal domain-specific roles of Gpr126 during trabeculation, whereby the NTF is required for maintaining cell-cell adhesion and compact wall integrity, whereas the CTF is essential to provide trabecular identity.",

    "Abstract": "Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have revolutionized the field of 3D molecule generation. However, the lack of effective evaluation methods for 3D conformations limits further improvements. Current techniques, in order to achieve the necessary speed for evaluating large number of AI-generated molecules, often rely on empirical geometric metrics that do not adequately capture various conformational anomalies, or on molecular mechanics energy metrics that exhibit low accuracy and lack atomic or torsional details. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage approach that achieves both high speed and quantum mechanical level accuracy. The first stage, termed the validity test, employs an AI-derived force field to identify atoms with elevated energy resulting from implausible neighboring environments. The second stage, known as the rationality test, utilizes a deep learning network trained on data with density functional theory accuracy to detect rotatable bonds with high torsional energies. To demonstrate the functionality of our evaluation system, we applied our approach to five recently reported 3D molecule generation AI models across 102 targets in Directory of Useful Decoys-Enhanced dataset. To facilitate accessibility for the academic community, our method is available as an open-source package.",

    "Abstract": "Despite centuries of advancement, the synthesis of carbon materials remains heavily reliant on energy-intensive thermal processes. Conventional methods require external heating for prolonged periods to overcome high energy barriers, posing challenges for sustainable large-scale production. Here we show an energy-autonomous synthesis pathway that utilizes the intrinsic chemical energy stored within a polyaniline-HClO<sub>4</sub> composite. Triggered by mild thermal, microwave, or mechanical stimulation, the precursor undergoes a rapid exothermic self-propagation driven by the explosive decomposition of perchlorate species. This single-step process, completed in ≈0.4 s, simultaneously generates intense localized heat and a massive volume of gas, which forcibly exfoliates and carbonizes the polymer into interconnected 2D amorphous carbon nanosheets. We demonstrate that this energy-efficient method achieves carbon conversion efficiencies comparable to traditional pyrolysis. Furthermore, the reaction intensity is precisely tunable via the precursor water content, ensuring potential for safe industrial scale-up. This approach also enables the atomic-level incorporation of transition metals, creating a versatile platform for the design of catalysts for oxygen and carbon dioxide reduction reactions. This work provides a scalable, energy-autonomous pathway for carbon synthesis and offers a platform for the precise construction of catalytic architectures.",

    "Abstract": "Limited cycle life remains a major obstacle to the practical application of high-capacity alloy negative electrodes in rechargeable batteries aimed at boosting energy density. The key challenges lie in the inherent uncontrollable volume changes and unstable electrode-electrolyte interphases. Here, we demonstrate a long-life self-construal tin (Sn) negative electrode for sodium (Na)-ion batteries enabled by in situ-formed embedded C-N anchors that integrate mechanical and chemical restrictions. This effect reshapes the alloying reactions with pronounced phase transformation hysteresis and triggers an electrochemically driven self-reconstructed structure for alloying reactions, therefore resolving the uncontrollable volume expansion and associated detrimental effects. C-N anchors also promote the formation of unique viscoelastic electrode-electrolyte interphases that comfortably accommodate large volume fluctuations for thousands of cycles. The designed Sn-based negative electrode exhibits long cycle life over 7000 cycles with a low-capacity decay rate of ~0.0036% at 2 C. Stable cycling of the Sn-based negative electrode is further confirmed in a prototype Na-ion pouch cell. This work offers an efficient design of employing the inherent volume expansion of alloy to electrochemically induce a self-constructed structure that comfortably accommodates volume changes, thereby ensuring long cycle life.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Prostate cancer cells of different anatomical locations display remarkable heterogeneity. This poses a challenge to the clinical relevance of pre-clinical models and the efficacy of contemporary therapeutic approaches. Here we develop the snFLARE-seq and mxFRIZNGRND methodologies to directly investigate the transcriptomic and metabolomic landscape of prostate cancer patients utilizing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens. A retrospective analysis reveals the clinical disparities of prostate cancer from peripheral zone (PZ), transition zone (TZ), and across PZ and TZ. The snFLARE-seq, refined for enhanced single-nucleus sequencing, unveils distinct cell type distributions and signaling pathways between PZ and TZ samples. Hormone therapy substantially affects cancer cells and microenvironment, leading to a polarized feature of epithelial cells and a subverted immune microenvironment. With improvements in metabolite extraction, mxFRIZNGRND reveals unique metabolic features of prostate cancer from different origins. The metabolomic results indicate that PZ cancer cells are in a metabolic-dormant status, which are probably awaken by hormone therapy. Integrative analysis of results from snFLARE-seq, mxFRIZNGRND, and TCGA database uncovers four metabolic pathways and related genes associated with disease aggressiveness.

    "Abstract": "Visceral adipose tissue (VAT) inflammation is considered as an important contributor of aging, however, whether there is endogenous factor(s) in VAT that counteract this process remains obscure. Here we reported that interleukin (IL)-10 expressing B lineage (B-10) cells are greatly expanded in aged VAT in human and mouse. In aged VAT, B-10 cells are the primary source of IL-10. B cell-specific knockout of IL-10 exaggerated aging-related inflammation and insulin resistance (IR) and reduced lifespan, which could be partially recovered via adoptive transfer of B-10 cells from wild-type mice. Aged VAT microenvironment enhanced IL-10 secretion and proliferation of B-10 cells. The proliferation of B-10 cells was mediated by increases in BAFF in aged VAT. Knock-down of BAFF in VAT compromised aging-related expansion of B-10 cells. On the contrary, VAT-specific overexpression of BAFF promoted B-10 cells expansion, improved aging-related inflammation and IR, and prolonged lifespan.",

    "Abstract": "The Rab11 endosomal recycling pathway is exploited by important respiratory RNA viruses such as IAV and RSV, aiding viral egress from the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. Late in infection, Rab11-containing vesicles specifically transport viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes towards the cell surface before packaging and budding. Rather than employing traditional Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, virus-infected cells generate remodelled Rab11-containing vesicles, as observed during IAV infection. Besides Rab11, no other conserved host co-factors have been identified among these various vRNP trafficking vesicles. Here we discover and confirm myoferlin's association with IAV vRNPs in the cytoplasm and colocalisation with Rab11 during late stages of infection. We also find that this role is conserved in late-stage vRNP trafficking of other viruses, including RSV and SeV. Myoferlin likely recruits the EHD family of proteins, which are involved in endosomal biogenesis, to these unique vRNP trafficking endosomes, highlighting myoferlin's pivotal role in viral replication.",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is driven by genetic alterations in the pancreatic epithelium (e.g., KRAS) coupled with dysregulated innate immunity that triggers tumor-promoting chronic inflammation. However, the identity of innate immune molecular regulators as therapeutic targets in PDAC is ill-defined. Here, we show in PDAC patients that elevated tumoral expression of the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC and its downstream effector Caspase-1 is primarily colocalized to the pancreatic ductal epithelium and prognostic for poor survival. In the mutant Kras-driven KPC PDAC mouse model, global and conditional (pancreatic epithelial) ablation of ASC, or nanobody-mediated targeting of extracellular ASC, suppresses pancreatic tumorigenesis. Whole transcriptome profiling and multiplex immunofluorescence reveal that the tumor-promoting activities of epithelial-derived ASC align with molecular pathways for mitochondrial respiration, metabolism (glycolysis), and immune responses. Our discovery that ASC-containing inflammasomes promote PDAC by acting as a molecular bridge between innate immunity, mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic reprogramming provides the rationale to therapeutically target ASC in cancers.",

    "Abstract": "Cryptochromes are photoreceptors with functions in the entrainment of circadian clocks or as proposed magnetoreceptors in birds or as light-independent regulators of stress responses in plants. Here, we show that the fungal cryptochrome-like photolyase CryA from Aspergillus nidulans is induced by light and oxidative stress and establishes negative-feedback loops for light- and stress-activated genes. The negative-feedback loops depend on CryA interaction with phytochrome and the HOG (high osmolarity glycerol) pathway transcription factor AtfA in nuclei. CryA translocated in less than one minute from nuclei to mitochondria in the presence of hydrogen peroxide suggesting mitochondrial functions and possibly mitochondrial-nuclear communication. The shuttle to mitochondria depended on the N-terminal extension and a cysteine therein, which probably induces conformational changes of CryA upon oxidation. Therefore, we propose CryA as a sensor for oxidative stress. Such an N-terminal extension is also present in other photolyases and some cryptochromes, suggesting evolutionary conservation of the mechanism.",

    "Abstract": "The interplay between nutrient availability and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) symbiosis during plant growth exhibits intricate complexity. In this study, we employ integrated physiological, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses to investigate how sugarcane differentially adapts to nitrogen (N) fertilization and AMF colonization. Under nitrogen stress conditions, AMF colonization significantly enhances sugarcane growth, increasing plant height, stem diameter, and biomass while stimulating root exudation and rhizospheric nutrient mobilization-particularly available N, phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Multi-omics analyses reveal that AMF induces nitrogen-dependent metabolic reprogramming in sugarcane roots, activating pathways such as carbohydrate and lipid metabolic pathways while suppressing butanoate and ascorbate metabolism. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identifies key root modules strongly correlated with soil N, P, and K availability, indicating AMF-mediated coordination of nutrient acquisition strategies. Field trials demonstrate that AMF boost sugarcane yield under nitrogen stress by enhancing root elongation and carbon partitioning for sucrose accumulation. Temporal integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic data highlights flavonoid biosynthesis as a persistently activated pathway across growth stages, potentially facilitating AMF symbiosis and stress resilience. Our findings elucidate how sugarcane optimizes AMF-mediated nutrient acquisition under nitrogen stress through root transcriptional and metabolic adjustments, providing insights for sustainable crop nutrient management.",

    "Abstract": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a highly metastatic breast carcinoma, frequently characterized by estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) negativity and limited treatment options. Our previous research showed that the second ER subtype, ERβ, is associated with reduced metastasis in IBC patients and xenografts. We linked its anti-metastatic function to the inhibition of actin-based cell migration and Rho GTPase signaling. In this study, we employed a genomics approach to fully delineate the signaling underlying the anti-metastatic activity of ERβ. By cross-examining responsive mRNAs and miRNAs against chromatin binding sites in IBC cells with agonist-activated transfected and endogenous ERβ, we identified key regulatory binding motifs, direct targets, and associated biological functions. Our findings implicate pathways in development, metabolism and tumor microenvironment in the anti-metastatic action of ERβ. Clinical dataset analysis associates downstream factors with patient outcomes, indicating new molecules with therapeutic potential and highlighting the relevance of tumor repressive ERβ signaling in breast cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Tumoral BRCA1 promoter methylation occurs frequently in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and contributes to homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). While constitutional BRCA1 methylation has been described, its relationship with tumoral methylation, genomic instability, and prognosis remains unclear. Paired tumor and blood samples from 136 TNBC patients (SCANDARE, NCT03017573) were analyzed for BRCA1 methylation, genomic alterations, HRD and outcomes. Constitutional BRCA1 methylation was detected in 20.6% of patients and tumoral methylation in 31.6%, including 11.5% with somatic-only methylation. In cases with constitutional BRCA1 methylation, tumoral methylation levels increased markedly, with 89% of high-methylation tumors (≥50%) associated with a Loss of Heterozygoty. Tumors with BRCA1 promoter methylation consistently exhibited high HRD (Homologous Recombination Deficiency) scores, comparable to those with pathogenic HRR (Homologous Recombination Repair) gene pathogenic variants (p < 0.001). Conversely, HRD was rare in tumors lacking both BRCA1 methylation and HRR gene alterations. Prognostically, constitutional BRCA1 methylation tended to associate with improved survival, while somatic-only methylation showed a trend toward poorer outcomes (p = 0.06). Constitutional BRCA1 methylation is associated with a high level of tumoral BRCA1 promoter methylation and HRD in TNBC. These findings support integrating constitutional and tumoral BRCA1 methylation into HRD assessment to improve patient stratification and precision treatment in TNBC.",

    "Abstract": "Gait deficits present an unresolved therapeutic challenge in Parkinson's disease. At the behavioral level, symptoms exhibit heterogeneity, including bradykinesia and hypokinesia during cyclical limb movements, and sudden, involuntary interruptions in the gait sequence, known as freezing of gait. The neural activities driving these various deficits remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the neural correlates of gait sequence interruptions with a deep phenotyping approach. For this, we transformed kinematic trajectories and cortical oscillations into continuous time series of neurobehavioral features. Next, we combined low-dimensional embedding with supervised classification to identify cortical oscillation features that drive gait deficits. In a rodent Parkinson's disease model, our approach revealed that gait, akinesia, and stationary movements occupy distinct regions in the low-dimensional embedding space. Among the predominant features separating the states, Hjorth complexity and mobility modulated at akinesia onset. Additionally, we validated our findings in two Parkinson's patients with freezing of gait, where neural features in STN recordings partially reflected the results in rodents. The presented neurobehavioral phenotyping approach is translational and can easily be generalized to the analysis of other complex movement disorders. Together, our results highlight specific neural features as potential biomarkers that may support the development of adaptive closed-loop algorithms for gait therapy in PD.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic intestinal inflammation is a key precursor to Parkinson's disease (PD). Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 R1628P variant (LRRK2<sup>R1628P</sup>) is a risk factor for PD in Asians. However, whether it drives the occurrence of intestinal inflammation remains elusive. Here, we report that LRRK2<sup>R1627P</sup> (the rat homolog) disrupts intestinal homeostasis during aging and toxin exposure in rats. Compared with age-matched wild-type rats, aging LRRK2<sup>R1627P</sup> rats exhibited shortened small intestine, reduced goblet cells, and abnormal epithelial cell junction structures. Mechanistically, these changes were induced by macrophage polarization toward a pro-inflammatory phenotype via TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway, resulting in PD-associated intestinal pathology, including chronic inflammatory, decreased microbial diversity, and increased p-α-synuclein aggregation. LRRK2<sup>R1627P</sup> also enhanced susceptibility to lipopolysaccharide-induced intestinal inflammation. Remarkably, TLR4 inhibitor ameliorated the age-related disruption of intestinal homeostasis mediated by LRRK2<sup>R1627P</sup>. Using the LRRK2<sup>R1627P</sup> rats, this study reveals a cascading interplay among genetic susceptibility, age-related internal imbalance, and exogenous toxin exposure in PD pathology. These findings provide critical insights into how the dynamic interplay of multiple risk factors overwhelms the body's compensatory thresholds, ultimately initiating the pathological process of neurodegeneration.",

Utilizing an integrated virtual screening strategy, 6 candidate peptides exhibiting potential saltiness-enhancing properties were identified. Sensory analysis revealed that these peptides displayed distinct taste profiles, with detection thresholds ranging between 0.04 and 0.12 mmol/L. Notably, peptides AGHDDFP, GYDTF, and NGYDMR enhanced the saltiness of a 3 mg/mL NaCl solution, demonstrating synergistic or additive effects, consistent with electronic tongue. Molecular docking analysis revealed that three saltiness-enhancing peptides primarily interacted with TMC4 through hydrogen bonding, identifying key interaction residues including Gln527, Glu531, Asp491, Asn404, Arg437, Lys567, Pro409, and Val498. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations confirmed the structural stability and tightness of saltiness-enhancing peptides-TMC4 complexes, supporting their potential effectiveness in modulating saltiness perception. These results indicate a promising approach for identifying saltiness-enhancing peptides derived from Pleurotus eryngii , potentially serving as taste modulators in reduced-sodium food formulations.",

However, these processes were exacerbated in Parkin<sup>-/-</sup> mice.

Clinical practice, however, requires multi-level severity assessment and corresponding diagnostic recommendations. A significant limitation has been the lack of high-quality, publicly available datasets with fine-grained cataract classifications and associated professional diagnostic descriptions. To address this, we constructed the Cataract Severity and Diagnostic Image Dataset (CSDI), comprising 187 fundus image cases with detailed clinical diagnostic reports. We also propose a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based diagnostic framework capable of fine-grained severity scoring from fundus images and generating professional diagnostic text. This study, to our knowledge, is the first to apply MLLM technology for precise quantitative cataract diagnosis. We benchmarked several state-of-the-art MLLMs on CSDI for severity assessment and diagnosis report generation, which confirmed high quality of our annotations.

    "Abstract": "Visual touch perception is fundamental to body awareness and social bonding, helping us perceive ourselves and connect with others. However, understanding its neural basis has been limited by a lack of comprehensive public datasets. To address this, we present an electroencephalography (EEG) and self-report dataset from 80 participants. It includes neural responses from 2,880 trials per participant, during which participants viewed touch interactions between two hands involving either direct skin contact or object-mediated touch. Complementing the EEG data are self-report measures on empathy, perspective-taking, vicarious touch, and mirror-touch synaesthesia, providing a robust resource for exploring individual differences in visual touch perception. Ninety unique videos were presented in four orientations, with trials evenly split between self- and other-perspectives, and showing touch to either the left or right hand. This design supports investigation into how viewing perspective and hand laterality influence touch processing. Technical validation reveals distinct neural patterns associated with visual, sensory, and emotional touch dimensions, highlighting the dataset's potential to advance research into diverse aspects of visual touch perception.",

    "Abstract": "The genus Oldenlandia encompasses numerous medicinal plants with significant pharmacological potential, yet their tissue-specific metabolic pathways and transcriptional profiles remain understudied. This study combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to compare the differences in five tissues (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits) between two closely related Oldenlandia species, Oldenlandia diffusa and Oldenlandia corymbosa. Using a widely targeted metabolomics approach based on UPLC-MS/MS, we monitored 1,343 metabolites across 60 samples from the two species. Transcriptome sequencing generated 272.12 Gb and 257.03 Gb of clean data for Oldenlandia diffusa and Oldenlandia corymbosa, respectively, along with 37,644 and 20,825 annotated genes. Comparative analysis revealed numerous differentially expressed genes, whose diverse functions were elucidated through GO enrichment. This comprehensive dataset provides a valuable resource for further investigating the phenotypic traits and metabolic mechanisms underlying the pharmacological activities of these medicinally important Oldenlandia species.",

    "Abstract": "Existing fabric datasets consist of isolated and non-time-series images, failing to reflect the complexities and variations present in real-world industrial environments. To support fabric defect detection in real-world industrial environments, we present a high-quality Time-Series fabric dataset (TSfabrics). By capturing time-series fabric images, TSfabrics reflects the continuous and complex nature of actual fabric manufacturing on circular knitting machines. TSfabrics encompasses 22 continuous fabric production scenarios and consists of 93196 grayscale fabric images collected under diverse production conditions, including different illuminations, production speeds, and fabric types. In addition, TSfabrics contains defect-free and defective samples, with pixel-level annotations that differentiate true defects from production-related \"cutlines\" found in defect-free fabric images. Meanwhile, TSfabrics covers a wide range of fabric defect types. To sum up, TSfabrics offers a valuable resource for advancing practical fabric defect detection methods and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial application. We believe that TSfabrics enables the development and evaluation of defect detection models that are better suited for deployment on continuous production lines.",

As features, the dataset includes timestamped gaze coordinates, pupil sizes, and event classifications, labelled as fixations, saccades, or blinks. All the data were recorded using the EyeLink Portable Duo eye-tracker hardware at 1000 Hz, and processed from raw EyeLink Data Format (EDF) files into structured files via an automated pipeline. The dataset was anonymized according to the Norwegian Agency for Shared Services in Education and Research (SIKT) ethical standards.

Its current estimated population is over 6,900 individuals in East Asia, whereas the Western/Central Asian population is nearly extinct, with no recent records of its presence in the wild. Here, we present a high-quality, chromosome-level genome assembly of the Siberian crane generated by integrating Nanopore long-read data, MGISEQ-2000 short-read data, and Hi-C technology data. The assembled genome spans 1.31 Gb, with a scaffold N50 of 83.45 Mb, comprising 33 chromosomes and additional unplaced scaffolds. BUSCO assessment indicated that 97.3 percent of genes in the genome assembly are complete. We identified 10.9 percent repetitive sequences and 21,678 protein-coding genes, of which 88 percent were successfully assigned functional annotations. This high-quality genome assembly and annotation provide a valuable genomic resource for comparative genomic research aimed at understanding the ecology, evolutionary adaptations, and development of Gruidae birds.",

We analyzed the entire degradation process throughout video lifecycle in this paper. By utilizing high-resolution (HR) videos from professionally restored films and their corresponding low-resolution (LR) versions distributed online, we proposed a novel construction method for LR-HR video sequence pairs, named \"Real-world+\". This method ensures that the pairs accurately reflect the real-world degradation process and are strictly aligned both spatially and temporally. We further augmented CTOVSR with synthetically degraded data, resulting in 900 LR-HR video sequence pairs, each pair containing 100 consecutive frames, featuring various unique elements of Chinese traditional opera. While the primary focus of this work is the dataset itself, our proposed dataset construction methodology also offers a valuable practical approach for the preservation of other types of precious historical heritage.",

    "Abstract": "Benchmark datasets for assessing polyploid genome assembly are limited because real polyploid genomes often contain unknown structural variations, complex repeats, and heterogeneous divergence among homologous copies. In this study, a minimal, fully controlled virtual dataset is provided for reproducible benchmarking of triploid de novo assembly using short reads. A 1-Mbp haploid reference sequence is generated and iteratively mutated to produce three genome copies (A-C) across 100 mutation steps, creating a divergence gradient that transitions from nearly identical to moderately diverged triploid genomes. For each divergence level, paired-end Illumina reads are simulated at uniform coverage and processed through error correction followed by de Bruijn graph assembly across multiple k-mer sizes. The dataset provides the full set of reference genomes, read sets, assemblies, and evaluation metrics, allowing direct reproduction of trends such as overcollapsed contigs at low divergence and improved genome separability at higher divergence. This compact resource offers method developers and users a transparent, reproducible standard for evaluating k-mer strategies and assembly behavior in triploid genomes.",

Many proteomics studies have been done on human RBCs, but the coverages are insufficient, limiting full understanding of protein profiles in RBCs and the mechanisms of their involved diseases. With major advances now available in the mass spectrometry-based proteomics filed, here we have isolated human RBCs into the membrane and cytoplasmic fractions and performed extensive offline basic pH RPLC fractionation followed by proteomic analyses. This in-depth proteomics approach has identified 4777 proteins in the RBC membrane fraction and 2350 proteins in the cytoplasmic fraction, yielding 5264 proteins in total which is probably the largest human RBC proteomics scale in the field. Such comprehensive RBC proteome datasets provide valuable data resource for elucidation of human RBCs and their involved diseases.",

A fine-grained label system comprising 18 categories (e.g., cropland, rural village, greenhouse and photovoltaic station, etc.) was established. Meanwhile, both a rigorously defined visual interpretation system and a labeling procedure including cross-check and error correction were proposed to maintain annotation quality. Finally, the proposed dataset has a total of 55,520 VHR images with 135,289 labels, which exhibits a long-tail distribution thus providing a challenging benchmark dataset. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of mainstream multi-label classification models on the China-MAS-50k dataset, where ResNeXt-101 achieved the best performance with an F1-score of 78.4%, but exhibited limitations in recognizing tail categories.",

Saplings were subjected to different treatments, including cold, heat, drought, and darkness, in order to induce the expression of as many genes as possible to obtain a highly comprehensive representation of the silver fir's transcriptome. The assembled transcriptome shows a completeness value of 94.8%, with 539,313 assembled transcripts, of which approximately 30% were functionally annotated.

    "Abstract": "Roots are essential to the strategies plants use to survive in variable environments, yet we know little of how they vary within species. Experimental conditions demonstrate that intraspecific plant root traits respond strongly to variation in the environment; however, it is unclear when these responses can be characterized as evolution in response to selective pressures of climate change over many generations. Sky Islands are model, natural climate relict ecosystems to examine climate-change driven evolution. Utilizing a common garden with replicate genotypes of Populus angustifolia (Narrowleaf cottonwood) from six Sky Island (SI) populations and nine adjacent Mountain Chain (MC) populations across three genetic provenances, we hypothesized that SI root traits have diverged due to historical isolation in warmer, drier climates. When grown in common conditions, populations originating on SI's showed convergent evolution across three distinct genetic provenances, which was characterized by 44.16% decreased total root length, 42.64% decreased average root volume, 43.31% decreased root surface area, and significantly less root trait variation, relative to adjacent mountain chains. Convergent evolution of root traits from trees originating on SI's is correlated with changes in mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in the field over the past ~ 125 years. These results demonstrate a consistent pattern in root trait evolution at the landscape scale and the role of climate on the evolution of root traits in a genetic and geographic context relevant to climate change.",

    "Abstract": "Tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis continues to constrain more than 10 million km<sup>2</sup> of high agricultural and livestock farming potential in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Despite its constraints to animal health and production, no accurate national and sub-national level data describing the distribution of tsetse flies has been produced for Uganda. To inform the tsetse fly density (flies/trap/day, or FTD) in Uganda and help advance along the progressive control pathway (PCP) for animal trypanosomiasis, we estimated FTD across sub-counties in Uganda and explored factors influencing variations in FTD across studies. Tsetse fly publications (n = 3462) were retrieved for Uganda from five life sciences databases, focusing on studies which inform the spatial distribution of tsetse flies, particularly reporting FTD across the nation. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 42 publications with the aim of producing an updated map to describe the spatial distribution of tsetse flies from pooled publication data. Current findings highlight substantial spatial data gaps with highly fragmented temporal collection periods. Of the 42 papers evaluated, only 20 reported FTD and were included in meta-analyses. To exhaust insights from extracted data, a zero-inflated multilevel Poisson was built to estimate the spatial distribution of tsetse flies. Meta-regression results found that the interaction of space (i.e. sub-county), time (i.e. collection period) and Glossina species explained the majority (87.32%) of observed FTD variations. Though several studies did not perform speciation of captured flies, the most predominant species reported in Uganda was Glossina fuscipes fuscipes. Across all records obtained, the western region of Uganda was severely under-sampled. Despite the limitations, like underrepresentation of some regions and declining report of FTD over years, we identified a basis for future research and recommend sub-county estimates be used to target spatial clusters when implementing risk-based tsetse control programs. Moreover, future research should target identifying environmental and climactic predictors of tsetse fly habitats, and we established a solid foundation for the future development of a national-level information system for the vectors of trypanosomiasis (i.e. an 'atlas').",

Given these restrictions, we present a Hybrid Vision Transformer (ViT) with a Graph Neural Network (GNN) and Region-Adaptive Attention to diagnose skin cancer. The ViT branch captures dermoscopy image global dependencies, whereas the GNN enhances features by exploiting lesions' spatial relationships. Region-Adaptive Attention improves lesion categorization by dynamically improving feature extraction in diagnostically relevant locations. Our paradigm for multi-scale lesion analysis accounts for lesion size, color, and texture changes. Meta-learning methods refine the proposed model to make it generalizable across skin tones and imaging settings. Our model outperformed state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms on benchmark skin cancer datasets.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Use of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the petroleum industry could be a cause for concern due to the large volumes of produced water (PW) generated during oil and gas extraction, the reuse of these wastes in water-stressed regions, and adverse health outcomes related to PFAS exposures. However, PW PFAS characterization is nearly absent in the literature, and hydraulic fracturing (HF) chemical disclosures often omit the identities of additives as proprietary. Here we evaluate PFAS in PW samples from three petroleum wells in the Denver Basin during their first year of production. Total concentrations of targeted PFAS (Σ 40 PFAS) were &lt; 35 ng/L in PW samples, with short-chain PFAS like perfluorobutanoic acid persisting throughout the sampled duration. Analysis of freshwater inputs for hydraulic fracturing (Σ 40 PFAS ~ 113 ng/L) and mixed fracture fluid (Σ 40 PFAS ~ 69 ng/L) indicated much of the targeted PFAS content was derived from the input water, and not from HF additives, however samples subjected to oxidation indicated the presence of PFAS precursors that would not be detected by targeted analysis. This study highlights that while PFAS content is low in the studied PWs, the potential for redistribution of PFAS in the environment may be a consideration for reuse applications.",

    "Abstract": "The rapid expansion of edge-cloud infrastructures and latency-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications has intensified the challenge of intelligent task offloading in dynamic and resource-constrained environments. This paper presents an Adaptive and Intelligent Customized Deep Q-Network (AICDQN), a novel reinforcement learning-based framework for real-time, priority-aware task scheduling in mobile edge computing systems. The proposed model formulates task offloading as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and integrates a hybrid Gated Recurrent Unit-Long Short-Term Memory (GRU-LSTM) load prediction module to forecast workload fluctuations and task urgency trends. This foresight enables a Dynamic Dueling Double Deep Q-Network [Formula: see text] agent to make informed offloading decisions across local, edge, and cloud tiers. The system models compute nodes using priority-aware M/M/1, M/M/c and M/M/∞ queuing systems, enabling delay-sensitive and queue-aware decision-making. A dynamic priority scoring function integrates task urgency, deadline proximity, and node-level queue saturation, ensuring real-time tasks are prioritized effectively. Furthermore, an energy-aware scheduling policy proactively transitions underutilized servers into low-power states without compromising performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that AICDQN achieves up to 33.39% reduction in delay, 57.74% improvement in energy efficiency, and 81.25% reduction in task drop rate compared with existing offloading algorithms, including Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), Distributed Dynamic Task Offloading (DDTO-DRL), Potential Game based Offloading Algorithm (PGOA), and the User-Level Online Offloading Framework (ULOOF). These results validate AICDQN as a scalable and adaptive solution for next-generation edge-cloud systems requiring efficient, intelligent, and energy-constrained task offloading.",

    "Abstract": "In this study, a novel heterogeneous palladium complex stabilized on Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) was synthesized via a three-step procedure involving the functionalization of iron oxide surface with an electrophilic group (C-Cl), subsequent nucleophilic substitution reaction with 2-picolylamine, and final complexation with palladium chloride. The catalytic performance of the resulting magnetic heterostructure was then evaluated in the selective hydrogenation of nitroarenes and N-heteroarenes using NaBH<sub>4</sub> as a reducing agent. The reactions proceeded efficiently under mild, green conditions specifically, in water at room temperature to delivering the desired aniline derivatives in good to excellent yields (81-98%) within short reaction times (25-90 min). While electronic and steric factors influenced the reaction outcome, this system consistently outperformed previously reported methods in terms of both yield and reaction speed. Moreover, the catalyst exhibited exceptional stability and reusability, maintaining its structural integrity and high catalytic activity over five successive cycles without significant degradation.",

    "Abstract": "Perceptual decision-making involves distinct sub-processes, including sensory encoding, decision formation, and motor execution. Studying the specific contributions of cortical areas to these components could deepen our understanding of decision-making mechanisms and inform therapeutic approaches for cognitive impairment. Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (spTMS) enables the functional investigation of cortical involvement during task performance, revealing the participation of specific regions in cognitive processes. When combined with the drift diffusion model (DDM), spTMS can precisely characterize effects on different decision sub-processes. In this study, 30 healthy participants performed a perceptual decision-making task requiring right-hand finger responses to complex visual stimuli. We delivered spTMS to sensorimotor cortex regions at two time points during task performance (200 ms and 800 ms post-stimulus onset). Results demonstrated region-specific modulation patterns: stimulation of the premotor dorsal caudal cortex (PMdc) selectively reduced reaction time (RT) by decreasing non-decision time (NDT), indicating its role in motor preparation. In contrast, primary motor cortex (M1) and primary somatosensory cortex (S1) stimulation produced opposing effects - decreased NDT coupled with increased evidence accumulation time (EAT) - resulting in no net RT change. These findings highlight how spTMS combined with DDM can dissect distinct cortical contributions to decision-making sub-processes.",

    "Abstract": "The development of low-cost insecticidal formulations using readily available household materials presents a potential alternative to synthetic pesticides, particularly in resource-limited settings. In this study, a kerosene-salt-detergent emulsion was formulated and optimised using a Box-Behnken experimental design to evaluate its insecticidal performance against field-collected adult cockroaches and its effect on neem seed germination. Percentage insect mortality (PIM) and neem seed germination percentage (GP) were modelled as response variables using response surface methodology. The optimised mix ratio consisting of 8.29 ml of kerosene, 7.41 g of salt, and 10.56 g of detergent produced a balanced formulation that the model estimated would achieve near-complete insect mortality while maintaining acceptable seed germination. Experimental validation of the optimised mixture produced a mean observed PIM and GP of 90% each, indicating modest deviations from the model predictions. Probit analysis of knockdown data yielded an estimated LT<sub>50</sub> of 12.0 min with a wide 95% confidence interval of 2.9-50.3 min, reflecting limited temporal resolution. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis identified broad functional groups consistent with the chemical composition of the formulation components. A preliminary material-cost assessment suggested that the formulation could be produced at low cost relative to some commercial insecticides. Overall, the results demonstrate a laboratory-scale proof-of-concept for a low-cost insecticidal formulation with strong knockdown potential, while highlighting the need for further species-specific efficacy testing, safety evaluation, and field validation before practical application.",

    "Abstract": "Ocular vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (oVEMP) using the belly-tendon (BT) electrode montage have well-documented superiority over other montages in healthy adults. However, little is known about its clinical superiority, especially in disorders with rock-bottom response rates, like Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorders (ANSD). Therefore, this study aimed to compare the response parameters of oVEMP to 500 Hz tone bursts from BT, infra-orbital (IO), chin-referenced (CR), and sternum-referenced (SR) electrode montages, between 30 adults with ANSD and 30 age-matched controls. Similar to the well-documented superior response characteristics in healthy adults, the BT montage showed superior response characteristics in ANSD, too. Additionally, the BT montage showed better inter-group discriminability than the IO montage. With a higher response rate, larger peak-to-peak amplitude, and better potency in discriminating a pathological condition from the controls, BT montage affirms clinical superiority over the other electrode montages for recording oVEMPs.",

    "Abstract": "Improving rice productivity remains essential under land constraints and rising food demand. However, spatial yield variation of super hybrid rice across agroecosystems and the mechanisms driving it is not fully resolved. We evaluated how thermal regimes, nitrogen management and genotype jointly shaped yield differences of super hybrid rice across two ecological regions. Field experiments (2021-2022) used three super-hybrid cultivars - Liangyoupeijiu (LYPJ), Y-liangyou-1 (YLY1) and Y-liangyou-900 (YLY900) - under four N rates (0, 150, 240, and 330 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) at Longhui and Changsha. Averaged across varieties and years, grain yield in Longhui exceeded Changsha by 16.8% (2021) and 26.7% (2022). These site differences were associated with higher temperatures in Changsha during panicle initiation and grain filling, which were accompanied by reductions in spikelets per panicle (~ 5.6%), total spikelets (~ 7.7%) and seed-setting rate (~ 10.6%). Longhui also exhibited greater leaf area index, dry-matter accumulation, and crop growth rate, supporting superior sink formation and grain filling. Partial least squares path modeling indicated that crop growth rate, total dry weight, and seed-setting rate mediated much of the observed yield gap. Nitrogen at 240 and 330 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> narrowed inter-site yield differences by improving yield components and growth traits. Among cultivars, YLY900 achieved the highest yield, while YLY1 showed the greatest cross-site stability. Under the tested conditions, these results suggest that aligning N management with genotype selection relative to local thermal regimes can help reduce temperature-driven yield losses in super hybrid rice.",

    "Abstract": "Connected Banking System Optimizer (CBSO) is a recently proposed meta-heuristic inspired by inter-bank financial transactions. It models inter-bank transaction behaviors across four sequential stages, collectively balancing exploration and exploitation. When confronted with complex landscapes, however, CBSO exposes three critical weaknesses: limited global-search capacity, an abrupt phase switch that disrupts the exploitation-exploration balance, and a pronounced tendency toward premature stagnation. These shortcomings become more conspicuous as problem complexity rises, undermining the algorithm's ability to locate the true optimum. To overcome these deficiencies, this paper presents an enhanced variant-ECBSO-which incorporates three complementary mechanisms: dominant group guidance strategy, guided learning strategy, and hybrid elite strategy. The ECBSO algorithm is comprehensively evaluated on the CEC 2017 benchmark suite and on real-world constrained engineering problems, outperforming CBSO, ISGTOA, EMTLBO, LSHADE, APSM-jSO, GLS-MPA, ESLPSO, ACGRIME, RDGMVO in all comparisons. Statistically, ECBSO secures first place across every test case, delivering Friedman ranks of 2.069, 2.138, 2.690, and 2.759, thereby confirming its superior convergence accuracy, search reliability, and optimization precision across diverse landscapes.",

The consolidation and hardening treatment of large areas of sludge in mudflat is the primary technical problem in the development and construction. On site research has shown that using solidifying agents to chemically reinforce coastal silt is an effective method. The curing agent was selected from three components: cement clinker, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>, etc. Through a three factor four level orthogonal experiment, it was found that the optimal formula for the curing agent was clinker 20%, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>4%, Na<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub> 1%。 The unconfined compressive strength test was used to verify the 28 day strength of the consolidated soil. The test results showed that the activity of slag in the solidifying agent was fully stimulated, and the solidification effect on silty sand was very significant. This curing agent formula has high scientificity and is suitable for the specific engineering geological conditions of Qianwan, providing accurate guidance for on-site construction.",

    "Abstract": "Aerial images suffer from problems such as extremely small target sizes, drastic multi-scale variations, and excessive background interference, which cause current object detectors to inadequately extract small object features, thereby leading to insufficient detection accuracy. To address these issues, we proposed the Cross-Stage Edge Information Fusion Network (CEIFNet). This network utilizes multiple Cross-stage Transformer (CST) Blocks for feature extraction, which are then fed into the Global Edge Information Interaction (GEII) structure for multiple transmissions of shallow edge information. GEII first generates processed shallow edge information through a Multi-scale Edge Information Generator (MEIG), then, to better perform cross-channel feature fusion, Cross-channel Feature Fusion (CFF) is proposed to fuse edge information with features extracted by conventional convolutions. Finally, after feature interaction through an encoder, detection results are output via a dynamic head (DyHead). Experimental results demonstrate that CEIFNet achieves mAP@50 of 43.1% and 95.0% on the VisDrone2019 and HIT-UAV datasets, respectively. Compared to the baseline model, the mAP@50 improves by 10.5% and 2.8% on the two datasets. Visualization results further validate the effectiveness of CEIFNet under conditions of excessive scale variations and severe background interference.",

    "Abstract": "Penicilliopsis clavariiformis Solms. is a rare filamentous fungus previously reported from various woody substrates and decaying plant matter. In this study, we report the first time host association of P. clavariiformis on seeds of Diospyros ferrea (Willd.) Bakh., collected from the Manoli Reserve Forest in the Northern Western Ghats, India. The fungus was isolated using standard seed mycobiota screening methods and identified based on both morphological features such as distinctive clavarioid ascomata, septate conidiophores, and cyanophilic conidia and molecular characterization of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA region. The ITS sequence showed > 99% similarity with authenticated P. clavariiformis sequences in GenBank. This is the first confirmed report of P. clavariiformis from seeds of Diospyros ferrea, expanding its known ecological and substrate range. The finding highlights the underexplored fungal diversity associated with forest seeds and emphasizes the need for targeted mycological surveys in biodiversity hotspots like the Western Ghats. Our results contribute to the growing knowledge of seed-associated fungi and provide a baseline for future ecological and pathological investigations involving this species.",

    "Abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of inter-vehicle communication, taking into consideration the stochastic nature of primary user spectrum occupancy, the highly dynamic fluctuation of channel states, and the timeliness requirements for communication among vehicles. The study investigates the joint channel selection and power control resource allocation problem in cognitive Internet of Things (CIoT) under high-speed mobility, with the aim of minimizing the system's Age of Information (AoI). The presented problem is modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and incorporates a meticulously designed reward function. Furthermore, to meet the timeliness demands, a multi-agent reinforcement learning approach is employed, with vehicles serving as intelligent agents that gather localized observational information and directly determine their transmission strategies. An improved Multi-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (IMAPPO) algorithm is proposed, which is based on a centralized training and distributed execution framework. Enhancements to the Actor network within the algorithm enable it to address the challenges presented by the discrete-continuous hybrid action space. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the enhanced multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm are verified through simulations. The results demonstrate that compared to alternative approaches, the CIoT resource allocation scheme based on the improved multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm significantly reduces the AoI for vehicle users.",

    "Abstract": "Despite cropland changes' critical role in ensuring food security, fostering socio-economic development, and balancing ecological protection, the regional variability in cropland dynamics within large-scale watershed economic belts remains understudied. To address this gap, we mapped land use change intensity to analyze cropland change patterns and stability in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB). Through statistical analysis, we identified key driving factors and predicted cropland changes for 2030 using the FLUS model. We also proposed region-specific sustainable use scenarios. The results reveal a systematic trend of cropland conversion to built-up land and water transforming into cropland in the YREB. Despite a steady decline in cropland area over the past two decades, the intensity of cropland inflows and outflows has remained balanced. The cropland center of gravity follows an east-north trajectory, with local meandering, isotropic shifts, and transverse displacements. Transport networks significantly influence cropland changes in the upper YREB, while climate impacts on cropland in the lower YREB are increasing. Future projections suggest the cropland center of gravity will shift toward southern mountainous regions in the upper and middle YREB and toward northern plains in the lower YREB. Among the proposed scenarios, only the Cropland Protection Scenarios (CPS) align closely with the cropland coverage targets of the Sustainable Pathways in Shared Socio-Economic Development Pathways (SPP1). Urban expansion encroaching on agricultural land is evident in Deyang and Mianyang, while competition with ecological space is pronounced in the middle and lower reaches and in riverine and coastal areas. This study provides a novel perspective on cropland changes in the YREB, emphasizing regional variability and the need for tailored policy interventions, thereby offering a scientific foundation for cropland management and planning.",

Theoretical properties of the estimator were obtained, such as the formula of bias and Mean Squared Error (MSE), which proves the analytical superiority of the estimator. The empirical efficiency of the simulation was demonstrated by the simulation performance in datasets of the health and education sectors, and the MSE values are consistently lower than those of the classical and competitive estimators. In further supporting its predictive power, machine learning classifiers (Regression Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression) were also trained on the same auxiliary inputs and evaluated benchmarked on the basis of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Although Machine Learning (ML) models demonstrated good predictive power, the estimator used had good interpretability and theoretical foundations. Moreover, the three-parameter Weibull distribution was found to be the most suitable and cut-points were calculated to facilitate stratified interpretation of distributional analysis. In general, the research proves the usefulness of minimal auxiliary information as complemented by structured sampling and hybrid modeling to enhance precision of estimation of variance in applied studies.",

The purpose of the paper is to create a nail disease detection system based on the advanced machine learning methods, including transfer learning and federated learning. The research seeks to show how machine learning and federated learning can be combined to detect nail disease performance with high accuracy without having to share data. The data include pictures of diverse nail conditions including Acral Lentiginous Melanoma, Onychogryphosis, and Pitting among others that are checked to maintain the quality of data in a uniform manner to facilitate the effective training of the models. The most common feature extraction models are ResNet152V2, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2, and InceptionResNetV2 that produce between 1,280 and 2,048 features per image. These characteristics are then pooled to create a unified feature space of 6,784 dimensions which is further narrowed to five major characteristics with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to create an efficient form of classification. A range of classification models, including Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) are compared, with the last one reaching the highest classification accuracy of 91.8%. The federated learning strategy enables the joint training of DL models by different clients to ensure data-privacy and has validation-accuracy rates exceeding 99-percent in both uniformly random and structured data distributions.

This coupling influences, often limiting the performance of metamaterials, filters, and phased arrays. In this study using both numerical simulations and experimental validation, we explore the electromagnetic coupling between identical helical microwave resonators and demonstrate how, under specific geometric conditions, near-zero coupling can be achieved even at highly sub-wavelength separations ( $$&lt;\\frac{\\lambda }{10}$$ ). Experimental samples are produced using 3D-printed molds subsequently filled with low-melting-point Field’s metal, enabling precise and repeatable resonator construction. The numerical analysis is further extended to infinite periodic chains of identical helices, revealing that similar geometric conditions enable control over propagating mode dispersion, including near-zero group velocity.",

However, conflicting results have emerged regarding whether PERM1 loss of function affects cardiac contractility. Here, we present data from a retrospective study compiling echocardiography data from all Perm1-knockout (Perm1-KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates used for various molecular biology experiments in our laboratory between April 2022 and September 2023. This yielded an atypically large number of subjects per group-84 WT mice and 88 Perm1-KO mice. We analyzed echocardiography-derived parameters of left ventricular (LV) systolic function. The ejection fraction (EF) was 65.43 ± 7.13% in WT vs. 53.98 ± 8.80% in Perm1-KO mice (p = 5.21E-17, unpaired t-test). Other parameters showing statistically significant differences between WT and Perm1-KO (p < 0.05) included LV fractional shortening, LV diastolic and systolic diameters, LV anterior and posterior systolic wall thickness, LV posterior wall systolic thickening, stroke volume, and cardiac output. Importantly, this large cohort of echocardiography analyses revealed a broad range of cardiac contractile function among WT mice, and this degree of variability persisted in Perm1 KO; however, the entire distribution was shifted downward, suggesting that Perm1 deficiency reduces mean cardiac performance without altering intrinsic variability. Overall, our study indicates that constitutive Perm1 deletion leads to reduced contractility partially compensated by increased LV circumference. This study provides strong evidence that Perm1-KO causes specific remodeling of cardiac contractile function and provides a retrospective power analysis to guide future prospective studies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This paper investigates the time–space fractional classical Boussinesq equation, a nonlinear partial differential equation that describes long-wave propagation in shallow water. The modified extended tanh function formalism yields bright and dark solitons, breather-type waves, and periodic waves. The dynamical behavior of these solutions is revealed with bifurcation theory and phase-plane analysis: stable and unstable wave profiles change, and there may be chaotic interactions among them. The sensitivity analysis and the linear stability analysis have guaranteed the robustness of the solutions to small perturbations. The key results indicate that the equation facilitates a deep set of stable nonlinear wave forms, which exhibit predictable dynamical actions, to promote research into nonlinear fractional wave phenomena. Shallow water hydrodynamics, plasma physics, and nonlinear lattice systems can utilize these findings. The future research could take these findings to a new level by adding stochastic effects, fractional systems of higher dimensions, and numerical simulations to make the analysis and feasible validation more thorough.",

    "Abstract": "Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) often use cardiovascular medications due to their increased risk of cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated the associations of baseline use of these drugs with survival and adverse events in MM patients initiating daratumumab, lenalidomide, or bortezomib combination treatments. Data from Phase III trials (CASTOR, MAIA, and POLLUX) were analysed, focusing on beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, ACE inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), diuretics, and statins. Cox proportional hazard analysis and logistic regression were used to assess associations with survival and grade ≥ 3 adverse events. Among 1804 patients, ACEI/ARBs were most common (31%), followed by beta-blockers (23%), statins (21%), calcium channel blockers (17%), and diuretics (16%). ACEI/ARBs was associated with better progression-free survival (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) [95% CI] = 0.84 [0.71-0.99], P = 0.034) but also higher odds of grade ≥ 3 adverse events (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.45 [1.06-1.97], P = 0.019). Diuretics were similarly associated with grade ≥ 3 adverse events (aOR = 1.53 [1.01-2.34], P = 0.047). Other cardiovascular drugs showed no significant associations. While ACEI/ARBs may improve progression-free survival, they pose safety concerns. It is reassuring that other cardiovascular drugs were not significantly associated with MM treatment outcomes. Further research is essential to fully understand the implications of these medications.",

    "Abstract": "Recent innovations have made it possible to produce megalibraries, millions of structurally and compositionally distinct nanoparticles on a chip. These megalibraries yield vast volumes of data that are impossible to analyze manually, necessitating the development of automated tools. In previous work, we created a binary classification machine learning model to select quality nanoparticle images for downstream analysis. In this work, we show that adding a custom image processing step before training can produce significantly higher-performing models in a fraction of the time and make them more robust to different image noise levels and microscope acquisition settings. The image processing pipeline proposed here effectively cleans raw nanoparticle images, enhances key features, and allows us to use much lower resolution images and simpler neural network model architectures. These features result in higher performance and significant cost savings. Experiments demonstrate superior performance relative to baseline, including an 18.2% improvement in recall and a 13.1% increase in accuracy. Given the high cost of downstream analysis, it is critical to minimize false positives, and our best-performing model reaches a precision of 95.9% and a weighted F-score of 95.1% on an unseen test set. Additionally, model training time is reduced from hours to less than a minute. We also show that, using this custom image processing pipeline, model performance is significantly improved at lower pixel resolutions compared to downsizing alone. We expect that adopting this pipeline for AI-driven automated nanoparticle characterization will allow researchers to rapidly and accurately analyze much greater volumes of data, thereby accelerating materials discovery.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents an AI-based generative model to address the cybersecurity threats in software development for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). The model aims to address the unique challenges SMEs face in implementing effective cybersecurity practices by leveraging generative AI to enhance threat detection, prevention, and response. Initially, we conducted a multivocal literature review (MLR) and an empirical survey to identify and validate cybersecurity threats and the generative AI practices used in secure software development for SMEs. An expert panel review was then assigned for the process of artificial neural network (ANN) and interpretive structural model (ISM). The ANN model can predict potential cybersecurity threats by learning from historical data and software development patterns. ISM is used to (1) structure and visualize (2) relations between identified threats and mitigation approaches and (3) offer a combined, multi-layered risk management methodology. A case study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. The evaluation has shown that the model significantly enhances SME online security and enables rapid adoption of sophisticated AI-based practices for detecting and responding to primary and advanced cyber threats. Phishing and ransomware received high assessments (Advanced), whereas some advanced techniques, e.g., AI-guided evasion and zero-day attacks, were at early stages of development (Understanding and Development). The general results indicated that generative AI can help organizations enhance SME cybersecurity, and some efforts are underway to develop use cases for advanced threats further. The AI-based generative model is a viable and scalable approach to the cybersecurity of SME software development. Such AI-based practices will enable SMEs to effectively protect themselves against various cyber threats systematically. Future studies should focus on developing contemporary threat strategies and on the impediments to global implementation, particularly in less resource-rich settings.",

    "Abstract": "In this single-center retrospective study, we compared visual performance and optical quality between a new refractive extended depth-of-focus intraocular lens (EDoF IOL, Model ZEN00V, n = 44), with a slightly myopic target, and an enhanced monofocal IOL (Model ICB00, n = 44), with the target refraction closest to emmetropia on the myopic side. The IOL power for the EDoF IOL was selected to achieve postoperative refraction of -0.50 to -1.00 D. Monocular distance visual acuity (VA) and iTrace aberrometry were assessed. Bilateral cases were analyzed to evaluate intermediate and near VA, and photic phenomena. Preoperative target diopter and postoperative spherical equivalent were more myopic in the EDoF IOL group than in the monofocal IOL group (all p < 0.001). Uncorrected and corrected distance VA were comparable between the two groups (all p > 0.05). Higher order aberrations were comparable between the two groups (all p > 0.05) except for spherical aberrations, which were lower in the monofocal group (p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis revealed superior near VA (p = 0.02) and an extended range of defocus in the EDoF IOL group with comparable photic phenomena. Implantation of the new refractive EDoF IOL, the TECNIS PureSee™, with myopic target diopter may be a viable option for improving intermediate and near visual performance while preserving distance vision and visual quality.",

    "Abstract": "This study developed a strategic framework for electronic waste management in Tehran, Iran's capital megacity, by integrating SWOT analysis with the Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (QSPM). Insights were obtained from a balanced panel of 30 local stakeholders: 15 public-sector officials from Tehran's Waste Management Organization and 15 managers of private recycling facilities. The QSPM analysis was then employed to prioritize the strategies, identifying six key approaches. The formulation of comprehensive health, safety, and environmental (HSE) regulations for e-waste recycling emerged as the top-priority strategy (Total Attractiveness Score (TAS) = 12.418). Subsequent priorities included optimizing e-waste collection processes (TAS = 10.764) and establishing dedicated e-waste sorting centers (TAS = 10.66). Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of this ranking against variations in key factor weights. The study identified significant gaps in supervision, infrastructure, and technical expertise, while also recognizing opportunities presented by Tehran's high population density and the availability of advanced technologies. To our knowledge, this work represents the first application of an integrated SWOT-QSPM framework to Tehran's e-waste challenge, offering a novel and replicable model for megacities facing comparable governance complexity and public-private integration barriers. The proposed framework provides municipal policymakers with a practical roadmap, indicating that the integrated SWOT-QSPM approach effectively generates tailored waste management strategies for megacities.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the role of miR-25-3p carried by human amnion epithelial cell (hAEC)-derived exosomes in regulating MUC5AC production and apoptosis in conjunctival goblet cells. hAEC-derived exosomes were isolated, characterized, and evaluated for their uptake by conjunctival goblet cells. qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, Western blotting, and ELISA were used to assess the effects of exosomes on MUC5AC expression and apoptosis, with a focus on the contribution of miR-25-3p. The interaction between miR-25-3p and its predicted target BCL2L11 was examined using dual-luciferase reporter assays. Conjunctival goblet cells efficiently internalized hAEC-derived exosomes. Exosome treatment increased MUC5AC expression (P < 0.01) and reduced apoptosis (P < 0.01). miR-25-3p was found to mediate these effects, at least in part, through targeting BCL2L11, thereby promoting MUC5AC production (P < 0.01) and decreasing apoptosis (P < 0.01). hAEC-derived exosomes, particularly those containing miR-25-3p, modulate mucin expression and apoptosis in conjunctival goblet cells. These findings provide mechanistic insight into how exosomal miRNAs may contribute to maintaining ocular surface homeostasis, suggesting a potential role for exosomal miR-25-3p in supporting ocular surface health.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Herbal medicines, derived from medicinal plants, are in high demand due to global population growth and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases; however, the use of substitutes or adulterants can compromise the quality of these medicines. DNA barcoding and metabolite fingerprinting are used to identify plants and ensure the safety of drugs. The effectiveness of authentication methods depends on the availability and coverage of the reference library. However, reference DNA barcodes and metabolite fingerprint libraries for traditional Indian medicinal plants are lacking, which hinders the authentication of herbal drugs and the elucidation of the therapeutic effects of secondary metabolites. In the present study, we developed a user-friendly ‘Comprehensive Database of Medicinal Plants, Molecular Markers, and Metabolite Fingerprinting (CDMMM)’ that provides extensive details on traditional Indian medicinal plants used in drug formulations, DNA barcode sequences, metabolites, and their therapeutic targets associated with diseases. CDMMM is an expandable data resource comprising 89 experimentally obtained DNA barcode accessions from 67 plant species, 3033 annotated plant metabolites, and 1414 therapeutic targets associated with 441 diseases from 20 plant species. The ever-expanding CDMMM resource is available at https://slsdb.manipal.edu/cdmmm/ . Overall, it is a powerful platform for taxonomy, systematics, species identification, and drug discovery, promoting knowledge and addressing taxonomic uncertainties.",

The spin-resolved Seebeck coefficients [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] remain negative and metallic, with magnitudes of a few tens of [Formula: see text] between 0 and 500 K and only weak sensitivity to small rigid-band dopings. Because the transport formalism yields [Formula: see text], we estimate the relaxation time using two complementary models, namely an acoustic-phonon-limited deformation-potential approach and an empirical metallic lifetime inferred from the Seebeck coefficient. The former gives sub-picosecond to picosecond lifetimes, while the latter yields shorter lifetimes of a few tens to a few hundred femtoseconds. The resulting conductivities fall in a realistic thin-film range and show clear in-plane anisotropy with [Formula: see text], reflecting anisotropic band velocities and effective masses. Within a two-current description, the spin Seebeck coefficient [Formula: see text] reaches a few [Formula: see text] with deformation-potential lifetimes but is reduced to a directional average of about [Formula: see text] at 300 K when empirical lifetimes are used.

A convenience sample of 381 nursing interns completed standardized questionnaires assessing their demographic characteristics, learned helplessness, clinical learning environment, and self-esteem. Latent profile analysis revealed three distinct profiles of learned helplessness among the nursing interns: \"Low Helplessness-Low Hopelessness\" (n = 127, 33.3%), \"High Helplessness-Low Hopelessness\" (n = 172, 45.2%), and \"High Helplessness-High Hopelessness\" (n = 82, 21.5%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that male gender, current pursuit of a bachelor's degree, and working 4-6 night shifts during the past month were significantly associated with the \"High Helplessness-Low Hopelessness\" profile (OR = 5.113, 8.796, and 3.207, respectively). Holding an associate degree was significantly associated with the \"High Helplessness-High Hopelessness\" profile (OR = 7.221). Conversely, positive family relationships and fewer night shifts (0-3) during the past month were significantly associated with the \"Low Helplessness-Low Hopelessness\" profile (OR = 0.071 and 0.253, respectively). Additionally, a positive work atmosphere, individualized teaching, and high self-esteem were significantly associated with low levels of learned helplessness (OR = 0.850, 0.826, and 0.834, respectively; all p values < 0.05). Given the substantial proportion of interns in the \"High Helplessness-Low Hopelessness\" group, universities and hospitals should develop targeted educational strategies to effectively reduce learned helplessness among nursing interns.",

    "Abstract": "The Flow-induced Motion (FIM) of elastically-supported triangular prisms is experimentally investigated, with system comparisons conducted across generators of varying rated powers, to reveal the hydrokinetic energy conversion of disc-type generators. The incoming flow (U = 0.556 m/s-1.209 m/s) covers the Reynolds number range of 48,567 ≤ Re ≤ 105,606 in TrSL3. Variable load resistances R<sub>L</sub> (4 Ω ≤ R<sub>L</sub>≤31 Ω) are applied to change the total damping in the system, and the optimal damping is determined through power generation experiments. The oscillation responses and energy conversion of the system are analyzed, along with displacement time history and power spectrum of the oscillations. Through experimental studies, the disc-type generator exhibits better power generation performance compared to traditional rotational generators. The results contribute to a more comprehensive understanding on the flow-induced motion and energy conversion of the disc-type generators, and the main findings can be summed as: (1) The best branch for oscillation responses is defined as the galloping branch at a larger load resistance, the maximum amplitude ratio A<sup>*</sup>=1.72 is observed at R<sub>L</sub>=21 Ω with the generator rated at 300 W. (2) The energy conversion of the system varied with different generators, suggesting that there exists optimal damping for the generators. (3) The generator rated at 200 W has the best performance on energy harvesting in the tests. The maximum active power is P<sub>max</sub>=21.09 W at R<sub>L</sub>=11 Ω and U<sub>r</sub>=8.1, corresponding to the efficiency of η<sub>harn</sub> = 9.15%. The maximum energy conversion efficiency is 12.13% at R<sub>L</sub>=11 Ω and U<sub>r</sub>=5.2, corresponding to the active power of P<sub>harn</sub>=3.94 W.",

    "Abstract": "Balancing of rotors requires a specialized device known as a balancer, which measures centrifugal forces by rotating the rotor and applies corrective masses to achieve balance. Higher rotational speeds enhance the accuracy of the balancing process due to more pronounced centrifugal effects. In this study, a novel balancer is designed that employs the influence coefficient method for mass correction. The rotor's speed is controlled through a dual mechanism: PWM pulse generation and a gear-based transmission system. Force magnitude and phase are measured using load cells and an optical proximity sensor. Modal analysis of the balancer structure reveals a lowest natural frequency of 216 Hz, enabling safe operation at speeds up to 9500 RPM without inducing unwanted vibrations. Additionally, motion simulation was conducted to validate the governing equations and assess the impact of sensor misalignment. Results confirm the accuracy of the model and indicate a misalignment tolerance of up to 0.25 mm.",

    "Abstract": "Understanding emotions in text is an important part of sentiment analysis, especially in areas like mental health monitoring, customer feedback analysis, hate speech and disaster management. Unlike basic sentiment analysis that classifies text as positive or negative, real human emotions are complex and often overlapping, requiring multi-label classification to accurately capture multiple emotional states within a single input. While transformer-based models have improved performance, challenges persist particularly in low-resource languages and culturally diverse contexts due to the scarcity of annotated data and the difficulty in generalizing in different languages. This study proposes Hyb-Stack, a hybrid stacked ensemble framework that integrates simple stacking and cross-validation stacking, combining predictions from four transformer-base models (BERT, DistilBERT, RoBERTa, and mBERT) using a Random Forest meta-classifier to enhance classification accuracy, adaptability, and cross-lingual generalisation. Hyb-Stack was evaluated on three datasets: a high-resource English corpus (SemEval-2018 Task 1 E-c) and two low-resource corpora, the Bahasa Indonesia hate speech and HaEmoC_V1, a newly constructed Hausa-language emotion corpus developed to address the lack of annotated data for this language. Experimental results demonstrate that mBERT outperforms individual base models, achieving F1-scores of 82.28 (HaEmoC_V1), 85.33 (Bahasa Indonesia), and 88.90 (SemEval-2018 English). Also, the EM-9 ensemble set (BERT + DistilBERT + mBERT) improves performance, yielding F1-scores of 89.48, 88.19, and 90.67 on the respective datasets, which surpasses both individual models and conventional ensemble strategies such as averaging and weighted averaging. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining multiple transformers with an optimized decision layer to advance multi-label emotion classification on diverse linguistic contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) represents an extremely aggressive brain malignancy with limited treatment options, poor prognosis and a highly heterogeneous cellular architecture, including a subpopulation of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). These CSCs frequently rely on developmental signaling pathways such as Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), which are typically dormant in adult tissue but reactivated in tumors. This study aimed to investigate how SHH pathway inhibition affects both bulk GBM cells (GBMCs) and CD133+ GBM cells (GBM CSCs), with particular emphasis on the influence of astrocyte co-culture, which more closely mimics the brain tumor microenvironment. GBMCs and GBM CSCs were cultured in mono- and astrocyte co-culture systems. They were evaluated through RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA, TUNEL assay, and cell cycle analysis. By comparing treatment and culture context independently, cyclopamine-mediated SHH inhibition and astrocyte-dependent signals use distinct but interacting effects on cell behavior. Cyclopamine treatment changed SHH pathway activity depending on the cell type and culture condition, whereas astrocyte co-culture regulated GLI1, GLI3, and SUFU expression through a mechanism different from cyclopamine's effect. GBM CSCs exhibited higher SHH secretion in monoculture, which was attenuated under co-culture with cyclopamine. Cell cycle analysis revealed G2/M arrest in GBMCs and G0/G1 arrest in CSCs, with astrocyte co-culture shifting CSCs toward G2/M. Apoptotic gene expression and TUNEL staining indicated enhanced extrinsic apoptosis (via CASP8) in CSCs, further intensified by SHH inhibition and co-culture. Astrocyte co-culture significantly modulates the molecular and phenotypic response of GBM cells to SHH inhibition, reshaping apoptotic and proliferative behaviors in both CSCs and bulk populations. These findings highlight the critical importance of the tumor microenvironment in therapeutic response and suggest that effective targeting of SHH signaling may require models that account for astroglial interactions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study develops and evaluates a high-renewable hybrid microgrid for rural Bangladesh. The objective is to design a reliable, affordable, and grid-compliant system that supports residential, institutional, and irrigation loads. The work integrates techno-economic optimization, sensitivity analysis, and voltage–frequency stability assessment within a single framework. HOMER Pro is used to analyze multiple hybrid configurations, while MATLAB evaluates dynamic stability. The proposed contribution lies in modeling realistic field-based load profiles, incorporating converter constraints, and assessing stability across different operating conditions. A PV–wind–biogas–battery microgrid emerges as the optimal option. It achieves 88.2% renewable penetration with a net present cost of USD 206,841 and a levelized cost of energy of USD 0.0207/kWh. Solar PV and wind provide most of the annual energy, while grid support remains limited. Sensitivity analysis shows that solar and converter costs strongly influence project economics. Dynamic simulations confirm secure voltage–frequency performance and compliance with Bangladesh Grid Code limits. The results demonstrate that the proposed system offers a practical pathway for low-cost, reliable, and sustainable electrification in rural communities. The framework can also be adapted to other locations with similar resource and load characteristics.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This study introduces a hybrid stellar oscillation optimizer with differential evolution (hSOO-DE) for high-performance tuning of PID controllers with derivative filtering (PID-F) in nonlinear temperature regulation of continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs). The hybrid approach combines the global exploration capability of the stellar oscillation optimizer (SOO) with the local exploitation strength of differential evolution, ensuring a well-balanced search between diversification and intensification during parameter optimization. The proposed algorithm was applied to a benchmark nonlinear CSTR model and comprehensively compared with state-of-the-art metaheuristic optimizers SOO, birds of prey-based optimization (BPBO), covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and differential evolution (DE) as well as classical tuning techniques including Ziegler-Nichols, Tyreus-Luyben, and Simulink Tuner. The optimization objective jointly minimizes overshoot and integral absolute error to enhance transient and steady-state control quality. Statistical analyses, including boxplot evaluations and Mann-Whitney U-tests, demonstrate that hSOO-DE achieves the lowest mean objective value with minimal variance compared to recent optimizers. Time-domain results confirm superior transient performance, reflected in reduced rise and settling times and minimal overshoot, while integral performance indices verify improved steady-state precision. Validation against conventional PID-F tuning methods further highlights the robustness and reliability of the proposed design. The findings demonstrate that embedding DE within the oscillatory structure of the SOO yields a robust and efficient framework for PID-F controller tuning in nonlinear chemical reactor systems.",

    "Abstract": "Traditional DRL-based resource allocation for cloud-edge-end computing primarily depends on known state parameters and real-time feedback rewards when making decisions. The traditional model, which heavily relies on prior knowledge and real-time feedback of the scene, faces challenges in delivering effective services in complex scenarios. We propose a DT-aided Expert-driven Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (E-GAIL) model that leverages imitation learning capability to jointly allocate multiple constrained resources. Firstly, we introduce a single-expert trajectory generation algorithm based on Actor-Critic and Noisynet by using the rich historical data provided in DT Networks. This idea can enhance the fidelity of the imitated expert trajectory by utilizing the critic to update the network iteratively. Secondly, we fuse different single-expert trajectories into a multi-expert trajectory to expand the coverage area. We also employ the Nash equilibrium to identify the optimal equilibrium solution and reduce the conflicts among different experts. Finally, the parameters of the generator and discriminator in E-GAIL are updated according to the respective gradients to fit the multi-expert trajectory during the training process. Once the task is uploaded, the E-GAIL Agent in the edge server can rapidly obtain the resource allocation policy even without prior knowledge or real-time reward feedback. The experiment results indicate that E-GAIL can obtain the best-fit expert trajectory in large-scale noisy environments.",

    "Abstract": "Sustainable development globally is highly impacted by increased air pollution which is attributed to increasing population, commercial and industrial activities. Combustion gas emissions attributed to transportation, social and other activities are a major cause of air pollution. To mitigate adverse impact of air pollution on human health, forecasting PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> is a necessity. This study employs Fourier series decomposition approach in combination with support vector machine and long short-term memory machine learning algorithms to predict PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. Hourly data was obtained from December 2020 to November 2021 for Mohammedia city in Morocco. The model's performance was evaluated using RMSE, MAE and R<sup>2</sup>. LSTMF and SVMF models in combination with Fourier series decomposition performed better than the SMV and LSTM standalone models. Hourly prediction of PM<sub>10,</sub> LSTMF model performed better than other models during Autumn season with closely followed by the model in winter seasons. For PM<sub>2.5</sub> prediction the model during autumn season was observed to be outperforming other models in all other seasons. These results were based on hourly prediction based on season. Then this study also, forecasted seven ahead for PM<sub>10</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub>. LSTMF model performed best with R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.95 (winter), 0.93 (spring), 0.85 (summer) and 0.96 (autumn) for PM<sub>2.5</sub>. For PM<sub>10</sub> the LSTMF performance was also good with R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.84 (winter), 0.92 (spring), 0.84 (summer), and 0.92 (autumn). This study highlights how hourly prediction can be achieved to identify in advance the patterns and trends for particulate matter concentration. This will aid the decision and policy makers to adopt mitigation measures and policy in advance to address air pollution issues during peak hours.",

Artocarpus lakoocha Roxb.

Total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of AL was evaluated using Folin-Ciocalte and DPPH tests. Cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects were measured with MTT and live-dead assays, while CASP-3, BAX, and BCL-2 expressions were analyzed via qRT-PCR and western blotting. Cell migration inhibition was determined by scratch-wound healing assay. The total phenolic content of AL was calculated as 541.3 ± 14.1 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g. The IC<sub>50</sub> value for the scavenging effect of AL against DPPH radical was 98.03 ± 0.5780 µg/mL. AL demonstrated dose- and time-dependent in-vitro cytotoxic effects on Hep-2 and SCC-90 cells and exhibited higher selectivity toward cancer cells than Detroit-551 fibroblasts. Microscopic imaging confirmed that AL caused a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability and a dose-dependent cancer cell death. AL also inhibited migration of cancer cell lines and modulated apoptosis related genes and proteins by upregulating CASP-3 and BAX while downregulating BCL-2. Overall, the high phenolic content, antioxidant capacity and observed in-vitro anticancer effects of AL support its consideration as a biologically active natural compound for further investigation in laryngeal cancer.",

    "Abstract": "Sandwich composites are broadly recognised for their excellent stiffness, strength, and durability while minimising their weight. This study investigates the fabrication, mechanical testing, thermal analysis, and microstructural characterisation of magnesium-carbon fiber sandwich composites for aircraft applications. The composite panels were fabricated using traditional methods such as filament drum winding, followed by hand layup and compression moulding with six stacking sequences, including unidirectional ([0°], [45°], [90°]), bidirectional ([0°/90°], [45°/-45°]), and multidirectional ([0°/90°/45°/-45°]) fiber orientations. X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigated phase composition and crystalline structure. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed two-stage degradation, with [0°/90°]<sub>4</sub> retaining the highest residue (73-75%), followed by the quasi-isotropic laminate (69-71%), while [90°]<sub>8</sub> showed the lowest stability (51-53%). Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) confirmed decomposition onset between 250 °C and 380 °C, with balanced laminates exhibiting reduced endothermic peaks. Mechanical testing revealed strong orientation dependence, with the [0°]<sub>8</sub> laminate exhibiting the highest tensile (223.8 MPa) and flexural strength (700.9 MPa), while the [90°]<sub>8</sub> configuration showed the lowest values. Impact behaviour contrasted with tensile and flexural results, where the [45°/-45°]<sub>4</sub> laminate absorbed the highest impact energy (0.42 kg·m; 101.43 kJ/m<sup>2</sup>). The quasi-isotropic stacking sequence Mg/CF[0°/90°/45°/-45°]2/Mg exhibited a well-balanced multifunctional response, attaining the third-highest tensile strength, second-highest flexural strength, and second-highest impact energy absorption among the evaluated laminates, while also demonstrating enhanced thermal stability as evidenced by higher TGA residual mass and more stable DSC transition behaviour.

    "Abstract": "Venetoclax-azacitidine chemotherapy is a key treatment for older or medically unfit patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). As venetoclax is metabolized via cytochrome P450 3 A, dose adjustments are required when combined with antifungal agents. However, data on venetoclax concentrations and their impact on safety and efficacy remain limited. This study analyzed the association between venetoclax trough levels and treatment outcomes in 152 AML patients (median age: 70 years). The median trough level was 1,518 ng/mL (range: 60-11,328 ng/mL), with significant interindividual variability, even after adjusting for antifungal use. High venetoclax trough levels were significantly associated with elevated creatinine and total bilirubin levels. Patients with trough levels below 1857.3 ng/mL had lower rates of hematologic toxicity during the first treatment cycle (92.9% vs. 100%, P = 0.041). In the second cycle, hematologic toxicity was lower in patients with concentrations below 1,299.3 ng/mL (68% vs. 90%, P = 0.009). In the treatment-naïve group, trough levels above 1857.3 ng/mL were associated with a higher composite complete remission rate (77.3% vs. 47.8%, P = 0.042). These findings highlight the need for venetoclax dose optimization based on drug levels to improve both safety and efficacy in AML treatment.",

    "Abstract": "Advances in generative and federated artificial intelligence enable privacy-aware diagnostic systems that integrate multimodal reasoning and explainability. This work introduces DermaGPT, a federated multimodal framework for dermatology decision support that emphasizes trustworthy use under heterogeneous, privacy-sensitive data. The system combines a PaLI-Gemma 2 vision-language backbone, fine-tuned with low-rank adaptation, with a retrieval-augmented large language model that generates clinically coherent and patient-friendly explanations. To improve robustness and calibration across sites, a meta-learned trust function (MLTF) dynamically re-weights client updates based on uncertainty, calibration, and domain-shift indicators. Evaluated on four institutional datasets and an external cohort of 4,452 biopsy-confirmed clinical and dermoscopic images, DermaGPT achieved 90.2% diagnostic accuracy across 11 lesion types and 93.3% accuracy in malignancy prediction, with well-calibrated outputs under federated training. Expert dermatologists rated its explanations as clear and clinically relevant; these ratings were obtained on class-level canonical exemplars rather than per-image reports. In our deployment threat model, images are processed locally by the vision module; when a third-party LLM is used, only text (a short diagnostic summary and the user question) is transmitted, which may still be considered sensitive health data. Taken together, these results indicate that a trust-aware, federated multimodal design can deliver interpretable, efficient, and privacy-aware dermatology decision support that is intended to augment rather than replace clinician judgment.",

    "Abstract": "Heavy metal contamination in aquatic environments constitutes a critical environmental and public health challenge necessitating advanced remediation technologies. This investigation presents a novel dual-functional adsorbent design achieving synergistic selective adsorption through amino-carboxyl cooperative binding mechanisms. Dual-functional amino-carboxyl co-modified Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> nanoparticles (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-NH<sub>2</sub>-COOH) were synthesized via sequential silanization and carboxylation reactions, yielding functional group densities of 1.62 mmol/g (amino) and 1.23 mmol/g (carboxyl) while preserving strong magnetic properties (Ms = 58.4 emu/g) enabling efficient separation. The synthesized nanoparticles exhibited superior maximum adsorption capacities following Langmuir isotherm behavior: qm = 125.3 mg/g for Pb<sup>2+</sup> and qm = 98.7 mg/g for Cd<sup>2+</sup> in single-component systems, representing 27-30% enhancement compared to single-functional modifications. In competitive binary systems, selectivity coefficients (αPb/Cd = qe, Pb·Ce, Cd/qe, Cd·Ce, Pb) ranged from 2.8 to 4.7, demonstrating preferential Pb<sup>2+</sup> binding governed by hard-soft acid-base (HSAB) coordination preferences. Comprehensive characterization (XRD, TEM, FTIR, VSM, BET, XPS) confirmed successful dual-functionalization while maintaining the inverse spinel crystal structure (space group Fd3m, a = 8.392 Å). Kinetic studies revealed pseudo-second-order behavior (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.99) with rate constants k<sub>2</sub> = 0.00147 g·mg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> for Pb<sup>2+</sup> and k<sub>2</sub> = 0.00089 g·mg<sup>-1</sup>·min<sup>-1</sup> for Cd<sup>2+</sup>, indicating chemisorption-dominated mechanisms. Activation energies calculated from Arrhenius plots (Ea = 24.7 kJ/mol for Pb<sup>2+</sup>, 28.3 kJ/mol for Cd<sup>2+</sup>) confirmed chemical binding processes. Thermodynamic parameters (ΔG° = -18.7 to -24.3 kJ/mol, ΔH° = 12.4 kJ/mol, ΔS° = 98.5 J·mol<sup>-1</sup>·K<sup>-1</sup> for Pb<sup>2+</sup>) indicated spontaneous endothermic adsorption with increased entropy at the solid-liquid interface. Langmuir isotherm modeling (qe = qmbCe/(1 + bCe)) yielded excellent correlation (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.98) across concentration ranges of 5-300 mg/L. The synergistic mechanism between amino and carboxyl groups enhanced selectivity through differential coordination preferences, with quantified synergy factors (S = qe, dual/(qe, amino + qe, carboxyl)) of SPb = 1.34 and SCd = 1.18 demonstrating cooperative enhancement exceeding simple additive contributions. DFT calculations at B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level revealed ΔEbind = -198.5 kJ/mol for mixed-ligand chelate formation, providing 41.7 kJ/mol additional stabilization compared to single-site binding. The dual-functional magnetic adsorbent demonstrated > 85% capacity retention after five regeneration cycles, < 5 min magnetic separation time under 0.3 T field, and excellent performance in multi-metal systems with interference resistance (< 15% capacity reduction at 200 mg/L Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup>), showing significant potential for sustainable heavy metal remediation with enhanced selectivity in competitive adsorption scenarios.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2024 to January 2025, involving 3,000 older persons aged 60 years and above across 11 municipal zones of Shiraz. Stratified random sampling was used. Environmental data (green space per capita, population density, waste production) were extracted from municipal records. Health outcomes (BMI, frailty, depression, anxiety, and life satisfaction) were assessed using validated tools (GDS-4, GAI-5, LSI-Z). Statistical analyses included regression models and machine learning (Decision Tree, SVM). The SVM model demonstrated superior predictive performance (R²=0.75 for frailty) compared to Decision Trees (R²=0.71). Key predictive relationships emerged: each 1 m² increase in green space per capita predicted a 0.8-point reduction in depression scores (95% CI: -1.2 to -0.4) and 0.3-point lower frailty index. Waste production exceeding 250 kg/capita was associated with 35% greater fall risk (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.12–1.63). Population density showed nonlinear associations with outcomes in SVM models, with thresholds varying by health indicator. Environmental quality plays a critical role in older adults’ health. “Urban planning strategies that enhance green spaces and strengthen waste management systems may substantially improve health outcomes among older adults in urban settings.",

    "Abstract": "The persistent global spread of dengue virus (DENV) necessitates the identification of novel antiviral therapeutics. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain of the non-structural protein 5 (NS5) is a validated target for therapy due to its critical roles in viral genome replication. In this study, we used a structure-guided virtual screening approach to identify potent phytochemical inhibitors of DENV RdRp from the Plant Secondary Compound Database (PSC-db) by focusing on 326 flavonoids. Following drug-likeness filtering and hierarchical docking with MM-GBSA analysis, five top candidates were identified, with PSCdb01560 emerging as the most promising. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations over 500 ns revealed PSCdb01560's exceptional binding stability, characterised by low protein-ligand RMSD and sustained binding stability. Free energy landscape analysis demonstrated its occupation of deep, well-defined conformational basins. At the same time, post-MD MM-GBSA yielded a binding free energy of -91.65 kcal/mol-outperforming the reference compound. Structural superimposition confirmed strong conformational fidelity between docked and minimum-energy poses (RMSD 1.68 Å). Together, our approach points toward PSCdb01560 as the putative inhibitor molecule that outperforms existing flavonoid leads in thermodynamic and kinetic descriptors. The results thus provide the avenue for experimental validation, such as enzymatic and antiviral screens, in hopes of turning these in silico observations into viable therapeutic development for dengue.",

    "Abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains a challenging malignancy to treat, with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) revolutionizing patient management. This pilot study, evaluated the efficacy and safety of combination therapy comprising camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, and autologous cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell therapy in patients with refractory ccRCC. Twenty-one patients with refractory ccRCC were randomly assigned to receive either camrelizumab monotherapy (control group, n = 12) or camrelizumab combined with CIK cell re-transfusion (trial group, n = 9). Due to early termination (21 of 60 planned patients), all endpoints were exploratory. The objective response rate (ORR) was numerically higher in the combination group (55.6% vs. 41.7%; odds ratio 1.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32-9.51), but not statistically significant. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 28.5 vs. 8.67 months (hazard ratio [HR] 0.40, 95% CI: 0.12-1.34), and median overall survival (OS) was not reached vs. 57.47 months (HR 0.48, 95% CI: 0.09-2.53). One patient in the trial group achieved a complete metabolic response (CMR). The combination was well-tolerated without new safety signals. Exploratory analysis suggested that higher baseline PD-1 expression on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells might be associated with a better response, and the frequency of PD-1 positive cells tended to decrease after camrelizumab administration. The addition of CIK cell therapy to anti-PD-1 antibody showed signals of potential benefit in refractory ccRCC with a tolerable safety profile. This pilot study suggests the combination approach appears feasible and warrants investigation in larger trials in pretreated ccRCC patients.Registry: ClinicalTrials.gov, TRN: NCT03987698, Registration date: 17 June 2019.",

    "Abstract": "One-dimensional photonic crystal (1D-PC) biosensors are promising for applications like cancer detection due to their high sensitivity, but their performance is often compromised by unavoidable fabrication errors. However, theoretical analyses often do not quantitatively assess the impact of these fabrication errors on key sensor performance parameters, such as sensitivity and peak width. This study addresses this issue by performing a statistical analysis to investigate how random fabrication deviations influence these performance metrics, thereby providing a more realistic evaluation of sensor stability and robustness. For a designed 1D-PC biosensor, the transmission spectrum was first calculated using the transfer matrix method (TMM). A statistical simulation was then performed to analyze how random errors in layer thickness affect the sensor's performance at various error levels (δ) and at two incidence angles, 0° and 85°, with 100 iterations per level. The results showed that as fabrication errors increase, the values for the transmission peak position and Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) deviate from their ideal, error-free state. The sensitivity also fluctuates around the ideal value. Interestingly, it was found that some sensor instances could achieve sensitivities higher than the ideal, error-free value. The findings confirm that the 85° incidence angle, previously optimized<sup>1</sup> for high sensitivity, also provides enhanced resistance to fabrication errors compared to normal incidence, making it a robust choice for practical applications and guiding the design of more stable biosensors.",

    "Abstract": "The composition and metabolic characteristics of gut microbiota in heart transplant patients with and without preoperative and postoperative infection were investigated to elucidate the impact of antibiotics and immunosuppressants. Twenty patients undergoing allogeneic heart transplantation were enrolled. Gut microbiota profiles were analyzed via 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolic pathway prediction (PICRUSt2) at 5-9 days preoperatively and 30 days postoperatively. Patients were categorized into preoperative non-infected (Pre-NI), preoperative infected (Pre-I), postoperative non-infected (Post-NI) and postoperative infected (Post-I) groups for comparative analysis. Alpha/beta diversity, Maaslin and functional analyses were performed. Preoperative microbiota had similar α-diversity indices and community structures among groups. Pre-NI microbiota were dominated by Bacteroides and Pre-I samples were enriched with Enterococcus casseliflavus、Limosilactobacillus and Weissella cibaria. Post-NI patients showed higher microbial diversity (Shannon/Simpson indices) and Blautia (butyrate-producer) whereas Post-I patients formed a distinct cluster with Enterococcus faecium dominance. Metabolic analysis highlighted Blautia-associated pathways, e.g., L-1,2-propanediol degradation. Dynamic preoperative shifts in the Bacteroides-Enterococcus-Limosilactobacillus axis and postoperative shifts toward Blautia-Enterococcus dominance were found in heart transplant patients and were associated with infection status and antibiotic exposure. Dual-target intervention with an emphasis on restoring butyrate-producing microbiota and monitoring Enterococcus dynamics is recommended to optimize personalized infection control systems in transplant patients.",

    "Abstract": "This paper investigates the design of a robust controller for the trajectory tracking issue of an underactuated quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) subject to multiple disturbances. An anti-disturbance control framework is proposed by utilizing extended state observer (ESO) and neural network technology. Firstly, the dynamic model of the quadrotor UAV under wind and payload disturbance is established. To actively estimate the lumped disturbance of the UAV system, an ESO with only one parameter is introduced and the disturbances are transformed into the extended state of the UAV system for estimation. Secondly, an adaptive tracking controller that does not accurately obtain the dynamic model knowledge is constructed based on neural network method, where weights of the network can be automatically adjusted by the developed adaptive law. Then, finite-time convergency is analyzed for the ESO with only one parameter, and the Lyapunov criterion is adopted to verify the uniform ultimate boundedness of the UAV closed-loop system. Finally, various simulations under different scenarios are carried out to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. For comparison, linear active disturbance rejection control (LADRC), sliding mode control (SMC), model-free based terminal SMC (MFTSMC), and adaptive fractional-order control (ADFOC) algorithms are introduced. Moreover, the physical experiment is given to validate the practicability of the proposed method.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Arterial stiffening is influenced by the organization of focal adhesions in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We investigated the contribution of α v integrins to both arterial wall stiffness (Young’s modulus measured by echography) and VSMC stiffness (assessed by atomic force microscopy). Mice with VSMC-specific deletion of α v integrins (α v SMKO ) were compared with controls at baseline and following angiotensin II infusion. Unstimulated cultured α v -deficient (α v -KD) VSMCs exhibited higher stiffness than controls, with a further increase after angiotensin II. To interpret AFM measurements performed at shallow indentation depths, we developed a computational model of VSMC nanoindentation. Simulations showed that higher apparent Young’s moduli at shallow indentation fall within the experimental range of α v -KD cells. These cells also displayed enhanced actin polymerization, further amplified by angiotensin II through the formation of cortical F-actin. In vivo, arterial pressure and wall elastic modulus were similar between α v SMKO and control mice at baseline and after angiotensin II, despite α v SMKO mice exhibiting lower elastin and higher collagen content under angiotensin II. Together, these findings indicate that the comparable increase in arterial stiffness observed in α v SMKO mice under angiotensin II is driven primarily by elevated VSMC stiffness resulting from cortical actin redistribution, which outweighs extracellular matrix changes.",

    "Abstract": "MALAT1 is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) with altered expression in many cancers but poorly studied in B-cell neoplasms like mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a very aggressive B-cell lymphoma. To elucidate the role of MALAT1 in MCL we have investigated its expression in 219 primary tumors using microarray data. We also analyzed the expression of its natural antisense transcript (TALAM1), which is key for the processing of MALAT1 RNA to its active isoform. High expression of MALAT1/TALAM1 lncRNAs was consistently linked to favorable clinical behavior in MCL, independently of other alterations previously described to influence MCL prognosis. In concordance with the observed clinical association, we found that the increased expression of these lncRNAs was inversely associated with gene signatures related to a proliferative and activation phenotype (MCL35-proliferation/BCR signaling signatures) in MCL samples from lymph nodes as peripheral blood. Finally, functional studies of MALAT1 in MCL primary samples showed that its levels were downregulated by microenvironmental stimuli and EZH2 activity, a known epigenetic factor induced by pro-proliferative stimuli and previously related with poor MCL prognosis. Altogether, these data support the favorable prognostic value of MALAT1 expression in MCL, and the MALAT1 dual role as oncogene or tumor suppressor in different neoplasms.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Autonomous robotic prostheses can aid individuals with limb loss regain functionality and near-normal appearance. However, to psychologically integrate such limbs into one’s body image, it is necessary to understand how movement characteristics, such as movement speed, affect the sense of embodiment. Using a VR simulation, we investigated how the speed of autonomous lower-arm movements affects embodiment and user-perception. Nineteen healthy participants embodied an amputated virtual avatar with a prosthetic lower left-arm moving autonomously at six different speeds following minimum-jerk trajectories. Participants rated sense of body ownership, sense of agency, usability, competence, warmth, and discomfort after performing a reaching task at each speed. Ownership, sense of agency, and usability were highest for moderate speeds (autonomous movements lasting 1 s), and were significantly lower for both faster (125 ms) and slower (4 s) movements ( p &lt; 0.05). Competence was significantly higher at moderate and moderately fast speeds compared to slower speeds. Discomfort was significantly higher at the fastest speed compared to moderate and slower speeds. Overall, the results show a tendency of moderate movement speeds being favorable for user perception of autonomous limbs and hint at the existence of an optimal speed or a speed range for enhancing embodiment and usability.",

    "Abstract": "The objective of this paper is to analyze the species diversity change following the invasion of L. camara and grass coverage in the woodland in the Somaline Region, Ethiopia. To achieve the objectives, two adjusted sites were selected (invaded and non-invaded); at each site, a five-transect line with a distance of 500 m was established. In this transect line, 30 plots with a size of 20 m * 20 m and a distance of 200 m were established for collecting tree and shrub data, while seedlings, saplings, and herbaceous data were collected in a 1 m * 1 m plot. Diversity indices were used for the data analysis. The study result indicates that 23 species with 12 families of herb, grass, shrub, and tree species were identified in the study area. The comparison of the Shannon diversity index and evenness showed that the non-invaded site demonstrated more diversity as compared to the invaded site. Additionally, the correlation result indicates that the rate of L. camara invasion negatively correlates with the Shannon diversity index and evenness, with a correlation coefficient of -0.78 (p = 0.00) and - 0.73 (p = 0.00), respectively. Furthermore, grass and herb coverage: the non-invaded area has high grass and herb coverage with 77.7 ± 12.3, while the invaded area has 29.9 ± 17. In addition, the correlation results indicated that the rate of L. camara invasion had an adverse effect on grass and herb coverage. The invasion of L. camara leads to a decline in species diversity, the number of seedlings and saplings, and grass and herb cover in the study area. Consequently, future research explores the specific interactions between L. camara and native species to better understand the impact of this invasion on local ecosystems, as well as its effects on soil nutrients, microbial communities, and overall composition.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate prediction of the spectral power distribution of light-emitting diodes in multi-phosphor systems is challenging because of the influence of material composition and operating conditions. This paper proposes a spectral prediction framework that combines a Gaussian mathematical model with an improved residual neural network. First, light-emitting diode samples were fabricated using red and green phosphors, and their spectral power distributions were measured. The Gaussian model was then employed to extract the characteristic parameters from the continuous spectral power distributions, and these parameters were used to construct the corresponding dataset. Based on this dataset, a neural network framework was established to map the phosphor mixing ratio, phosphor-to-silicone ratio, and drive current to the Gaussian parameters. Through systematic comparative and extended validation experiments, it is demonstrated that the coefficient of determination for spectral power distribution reconstructed by the Gaussian mathematical model exceeds 0.99. The proposed improved residual network significantly outperforms baseline residual network and recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior predictive accuracy and stability. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the attention mechanism, while sensitivity analyses and independent dataset evaluations further confirm the robustness and generalization capability of the proposed framework. The proposed model significantly enhances spectral prediction accuracy in multi-phosphor systems and achieves rapid mapping from material composition and electrical parameters to the resulting spectrum. A new modeling framework for customized light-emitting diode spectral design is provided in this study, and theoretical support is offered for the intelligent optimization of healthy-lighting and high-color-rendering light sources.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Although proper donning and doffing of personal protective equipment (PPE) is critical for infection prevention, detailed characterization of problems encountered during these processes in real-world settings during large-scale infectious disease outbreaks remains insufficient. This study aimed to analyze the characteristics and distribution of interception problems in the process of donning and doffing process in a large cabin hospital during the 2022 COVID-19 pandemic in Shanghai. A prospective, real-world study was designed to collect and analyze data on irregularities observed during personal protective equipment (PPE) donning procedures in cabin hospital operations. The proportion of problems encountered during donning PPE was 5.29% (246/4,652), while during doffing PPE, it was 8.44% (382/4,525) ( P &lt; 0.001). The primary problem during donning PPE was related to problems with protective clothing, followed by problems with respirators. There was no significant difference in problem distribution among different posts ( P = 0.459). The problems related to protective clothing mainly focused on loose fitting around the head and neck, making them prone to exposure during donning (56.25%, 99/176) and contamination of the inner surface of protective clothing during doffing (46.43%, 91/196). Respirator-related problems included failure of the seal test during donning PPE (61.54%, 24/39) and shifting or loosening of the respirator during PPE doffing (73.68%, 14/19). These findings identify critical gaps in PPE procedures and highlight the need for targeted training to address these issues, thereby reducing the risk of infection among healthcare personnel in mobile cabin hospitals.",

    "Abstract": "Soft tissue calcifications are frequently encountered in radiographic examinations. Since some of these calcifications are associated with systemic diseases and potentially serious conditions, accurate radiographic diagnosis can assist in managing the underlying pathology. This study aimed to determine the frequency and size of soft tissue calcifications in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans covering either the maxilla or mandible. 420 CBCT scans with a field of view (FOV) of either the maxilla or mandible were evaluated in patients aged 6 to 82 years. Depending on the FOV type, the scans were evaluated for the presence and size of various calcifications. Furthermore, associations between calcification frequency and size with age and sex were statistically analyzed. A significance level of 0.05 was applied. Tonsilloliths were the most frequently observed calcifications in both FOV types, followed by calcified stylohyoid ligaments (CSLs), with most calcifications being of medium size. Overall, soft tissue calcifications were more frequently detected in the mandibular FOV (p = 0.01). Independent of calcification type and FOV, a significant correlation was observed between increased patient age and both higher frequency (p < 0.001) and larger size (p = 0.003) of calcifications. Tonsilloliths and CSLs are the most common calcifications observed in CBCT scans of both the maxilla and mandible. In mandibular FOVs, especially in patients ≥ 50 years, particular attention should be paid to calcifications of the carotid arteries, stylohyoid ligaments, and tonsilloliths. An FOV‑specific checklist may improve reporting consistency and referrals for appropriate medical/dental follow‑up.",

Identifying optimal pacing sites remains challenging, largely due to patient-specific anatomical variability and limitations of current individualized planning strategies. In a step toward an in-silico approach, we develop two geometric deep learning models, based on graph neural network (GNN) and geometry-informed neural operator (GINO), to predict activation time maps on left ventricular (LV) geometries in real time. Trained on a large dataset generated from finite-element simulations spanning a wide range of synthetic LV shapes, pacing site configurations, and tissue conductivities, the GINO model outperforms the GNN on synthetic cases (1.38% vs 2.44% error), while both demonstrate comparable performance on real-world LV geometries (GINO: 4.79% vs GNN: 4.07%). Using the trained models, we develop a workflow to identify an optimal pacing site on the LV from a given activation time map and show that both models can robustly recover ground-truth subject-specific parameters from noisy inputs. In conjunction with an interactive web-based interface (https://dcsim.egr.msu.edu/), this study shows potential and motivates future extension toward a clinical decision-support tool for personalized pre-procedural CRT optimization.",

    "Abstract": "In-person motor and cognitive assessments for Parkinson's disease(PD) face accessibility, scalability, and geographical diversity challenges. We aimed to address these by integrating large datasets, machine learning (ML), and videoconferencing. We developed the Motor and Cognitive Videoconference(MaC-VC) protocol, allowing non-experts to remotely administer the MDS-UPDRS III and MoCA tests. In this cross-sectional study, we administered MaC-VC to 145 participants from 60+ geographical locations and compared the results with a large (n = 1264), expert-rated, in-person assessments from the PPMI dataset. The abridged, online-feasible MDS-UPDRS III accounted for 95% of the variance in complete MDS-UPDRS III scores. When comparing early-versus-advanced PD in each dataset (In-Person/Online), we observed consistent significant trends in four measures: MDS-UPDRS-III, MoCA, disease-duration, and sex. Using a bidirectional cross-dataset-validation technique, ML classifiers yielded high classification performance both within-dataset and between-datasets(AUCs>0.9), demonstrating predictive power across diverse populations. These findings support the feasibility and generalizability of MaC-VC, paving the path for accessibility, scalability, and geographical diversity in PD assessments.",

    "Abstract": "The NF-κB pathway plays a critical role in mediating the innate immune response downstream of activated immune receptors such as the TNFαR. Activation of this pathway is induced by several ubiquitin ligases (e.g., cIAP, TRAFs, NEMO, β-TrCP, KPC1), including Nedd4-1. Nedd4-1 comprises a C2-WW(4)-HECT domain architecture. We recently characterized a primate-specific splice isoform of Nedd4-1, Nedd4-1(NE), in which the C2 domain is replaced by a large N-terminally Extended (NE) region. Using miniTurbo BioID, we identified here several components of the NF-κB pathway in complex with Nedd4-1(NE) (but not with the canonical Nedd4-1), including IKKα/β and p105-NF-κB1. We further show that (i) Nedd4-1(NE) ubiquitinates and promotes degradation of IKKβ, therefore inhibiting phosphorylation and promoting stability of its substrate, the inhibitory IκBα; (ii) active Nedd4-1(NE) binds and destabilizes NF-κB1, an interaction that is dependent upon Nedd4-1(NE)-mediated KPC1 ubiquitination. Furthermore, KPC1 promotes translocation of NF-κB1 to late endosomal membranes, where Nedd4-1(NE) resides, to facilitate the Nedd4-1(NE): NF-κB1 interaction. Consequently, Nedd4-1(NE)-mediated regulation of both IKKβ and NF-κB1 suppresses NF-κB1 nuclear translocation and activation of its target genes; and (iii) Nedd4-1(NE) (but not canonical Nedd4-1) mRNA expression is increased upon prolonged TNFα treatment of cells. This work uncovered an E3 ubiquitin ligase that suppresses the NF-κB1 pathway to ensure termination of this pro-inflammatory signaling pathway in primates via a negative feedback mechanism; Such an additional layer of immune regulation has important implications for understanding inflammatory homeostasis and its dysregulation in human disease.",

    "Abstract": "The enzymes acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (ACATs) are membrane-bound enzymes that play critical roles in the regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis in various tissues. Here, we aim to assess the effect of ACAT2 on lipid accumulation in cervical cancer (CC). ACAT2 expression is enhanced in CC and is closely associated with the immune evasion and clinical progression of CC. Knockdown of ACAT2 expression in CC cells inhibits CC growth, improves survival in tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice, and enhances anti-tumor immune responses by natural killer and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Protein expression of sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2) is elevated in CC and mediates the transcriptional activation of ACAT2. E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase parkin (PRKN) expression is attenuated in CC, which results in a diminished level of ubiquitination of SREBF2 and enhanced stability of SREBF2. PRKN inhibits cholesterol accumulation in CC, activates mitophagy, and ameliorates immune evasion through inhibition of SREBF2/ACAT2. Overexpression of SREBF2 blocks the anti-tumor effects of PRKN in an ACAT2-dependent manner. The present study underscores the pivotal function of ACAT2 in CC progression and delineates its potential as a therapeutic latent strategy. This approach involves the strategic obstruction of the metabolic pathway associated with ACAT2.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background There are known sex disparities in temperature perception with lower thermal detection thresholds found in people assigned female at birth compared to people assigned male at birth. However, underlying mechanisms of these differences and the influences of sex hormones are not yet sufficiently understood. Methods To assess the effects of sex hormones on temperature perception, we measured in a prospective observational cohort study temperature detection and pain thresholds with quantitative sensory testing and subjective temperature sensation in transgender patients undergoing gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT). We included 12 trans women (male-to-female transgender) and 17 trans men (female-to-male transgender) before and 3 and 6 months after start of GAHT. As a control group, we measured 13 cis women and 10 cis men without hormone treatment at the same timepoints. Results Here we show that temperature detection thresholds in persons assigned female at birth at baseline are lower than in persons assigned male at birth. Accordingly, in trans women, temperature detection thresholds decrease with GAHT. Pain detection thresholds do not differ between sexes assigned at birth and do not change with time. Conclusions We demonstrate that in trans women undergoing GAHT with estradiol and cyproterone acetate sensitivity to temperature changes increases, consistent with the greater temperature sensitivity observed in cis women compared to cis men. Future studies need to assess at which neurobiological processing stages the relevant changes occur and what molecular mechanisms play a role. Trial registration NCT04838249.",

    "Abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging-guided acoustic trapping is expected to manipulate drug carriers (e.g., microbubbles) within the body, potentially improving carrier concentration at tumor sites and thereby enhancing targeted therapy outcomes. However, accurate trap generation remains challenging due to complex wave propagation through multiple tissue materials. Moreover, respiration-induced tissue motion imposes stringent requirements on computational efficiency for rapid phase updates. Here we propose a machine learning-based model and a closed-loop control scheme to modulate phase patterns rapidly. The model delivers precise time-of-flight prediction (mean err. ≤ 0.24 μs) within 26 ms for 196 transducer elements. In proof-of-concept experiments, computer vision feedback permits fast (about 15 frames per second) position adjustment of a trapped polystyrene ball (Ø2.7 mm). This control scheme helps lessen the ball's spatial drift induced by time-varying multi-medium environments. These experiments on robotic manipulation support our model's potential for future magnetic resonance imaging-guided targeted therapy.",

Motivated by SDG 16 and UN Security Council Resolutions 2250, 2419, and 2535 - recognising and facilitating youth participation in fostering peace and social inclusion - we developed and validated a global Youth Peacebuilding Beliefs Scale (YPBS), a novel measure of different types of peacebuilding across levels of the social ecology (i.e., microsystem, mesosystem, and macrosystem). We used a sequential mixed-methods, cross-cultural design with adolescents (ages 14-17) and young adults (ages 18-26) across two studies (Study 1: Focus groups, N = 199, Northern Ireland n = 78, Colombia n = 60, Israel n = 41, Switzerland n = 20; Study 2: Survey, N = 2771, Northern Ireland n = 514, Colombia n = 806, Israel n = 833, Switzerland n = 618) across four diverse cases to explore youth's contributions along the peace continuum from active conflict to stable democracy.

The harvest consisted mostly of adult snakes, especially females, perhaps reflecting greater commercial value of larger animals. Females grew much larger than males but had shorter tails relative to body length. Clutch sizes ranged from 5 to 46 (mean = 21.0) and increased with maternal body size. Adult females produce a single clutch of eggs annually, prior to the onset of the rainy-season, and likely remain with those eggs until hatching (based on behaviour of the closely related F. piscator in India). Testis volumes in adult males showed strong seasonal variation. The high fecundity and ecological flexibility (diverse diets, use of disturbed habitats) of this species is likely to buffer it against any population-level impact of commercial harvesting.",

The authors include an analysis of the utility of the recent American Psychiatric Association's (APA) revision of DSM-5-TR that now includes moral issues and how this conceptualization captures the experiences of soldiers fighting in the Russia-Ukraine War. The case studies presented reveal that there remain important experiences and responses that are not fully captured by the new APA conceptualization of moral injury, such as existential ethical crisis, survivor guilt, disruption of one's role or identity, and the failure of others to uphold societal norms and expectations. Various approaches to facilitate recovery from moral injury are discussed. These approaches include the use of debriefings, remembrance memorials and structured therapeutic interventions. These approaches are intended to facilitate the soldier's recovery from moral injury by providing immediate emotional relief, and by facilitating the soldier's cognitive awareness of how morally injurious events can change and shape individual and collective identity. This study highlights the unique challenges faced by military personnel in modern, high-intensity warfare, and the need for early and targeted mental health interventions, including building resilience and promoting psycho-social well-being.",

Six affected unrelated probands were used for interpretation only. We detected recurrent variants in the germline lymphoid cancer gene <i>FAM160A1</i> in 4 (9%) of the 43 families, and variants in other genes involved in lymphoid cancers: <i>NPAT, BCL9, HCLS1</i> and <i>ID3</i>. Variants in genes including <i>BCL9, LEF1, TLE3,</i> and <i>KLHL12</i> involved in the WNT/β-catenin pathway were identified, representing a novel observation. Some variants appeared to segregate with specific types of lymphoid cancers; others were shared across different subtypes.

    "Abstract": "Oxidative stress within the follicular microenvironment plays a critical role in oocyte quality and reproductive outcomes. This prospective study examines the association between follicular fluid redox status, maternal age, ovarian reserve, and clinical outcomes in women undergoing in vitro fertilization. Follicular fluid samples were obtained from women undergoing fresh embryo transfer cycles and analyzed for oxidative damage markers (malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, ischemia-modified albumin, sialic acid) and antioxidant parameters (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, and thiol-disulfide homeostasis). Participants were stratified according to maternal age (≤35 vs. >35 years), serum estradiol levels on the day of human chorionic gonadotropin trigger (≤90th vs. >90th percentile), and clinical pregnancy outcome. Anti-Müllerian hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were recorded as indicators of ovarian reserve. Women aged >35 years exhibited significantly higher malondialdehyde and sialic acid levels, accompanied by reduced antioxidant enzyme activities. Cycles resulting in clinical pregnancy showed lower oxidative stress and higher antioxidant capacity compared with non-pregnant cycles. Malondialdehyde levels correlated positively with age and follicle-stimulating hormone, while antioxidant parameters correlated positively with anti-Müllerian hormone and pregnancy outcome. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated moderate discriminative ability of malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione for clinical pregnancy. These findings indicate that age-related redox imbalance in follicular fluid is associated with diminished ovarian reserve and reduced in vitro fertilization success. Assessment of follicular fluid oxidative stress parameters may provide clinically relevant insights into female reproductive potential.",

    "Abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the predominant form of lung cancer. Ferroptosis is a novel therapeutic target against treatment resistance in NSCLC. However, its regulation by m6A RNA modification remains incompletely elucidated. m6A RNA modification mediates mRNA stability, translation, and splicing to target transcripts. Methyltransferase like 7B (METTL7B) has been implicated in tumor progression, but its role in NSCLC ferroptosis via m6A modification have not been reported. We aimed to investigate the mechanism of METTL7B-medaited m6A modification in NSCLC cell ferroptosis. NSCLC cells (SK-MES-1/PC9/H1975/A549) and normal cells (BEAS-2B) were cultured. The expression of METTL7B, long non-coding RNA 02159 (LINC02159), and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like 2 (ARNTL2) was determined. After METTL7B knockdown, cell viability was measured by MTT assay; ferroptosis-related factors were analyzed. m6A quantification was performed. m6A enrichment on LINC02159 was analyzed. The interaction between LINC02159 and KAT2A was verified. KAT2A and H3K27ac enrichment on the ARNTL2 promoter was detected. The roles of LINC02159 and ARNTL2 were validated. METTL7B, LINC02159, and ARNTL2 were upregulated in NSCLC cells compared to BEAS-2B cells. METTL7B knockdown increased iron ions, reactive oxygen species, and malondialdehyde levels and decreased cell viability, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione levels. METTL7B potentially upregulate LINC02159 expression through m6A modification. LINC02159 may recruit KAT2A to enhance H3K27ac enrichment on the ARNTL2 promoter, thereby promoting ARNTL2 expression. Overexpression of LINC02159 or ARNTL2 partially reversed the pro-ferroptotic effects of METTL7B knockdown on NSCLC cells. In conclusion, METTL7B inhibits ferroptosis in NSCLC cells via the LINC02159/KAT2A/ARNTL2 axis in an m6A-dependent manner.",

    "Abstract": "Microalgae offer a sustainable and adaptable source of essential vitamins, making them a promising alternative to traditional synthetic and plant-based sources. As natural and bioavailable nutrients become increasingly important, microalgae such as <i>Chlorella</i>, <i>Spirulina</i>, <i>Dunaliella</i>, and <i>Haematococcus</i>, known for their ability to synthesize a wide range of vitamins, including A, B, C, D, E, and K, are gaining more attention. The biosynthesis pathways of these vitamins are explored, with a focus on stress-induced techniques and the impact of genetic engineering on production yields. Recent innovations in photobioreactors and hybrid open-closed systems, as well as advanced extraction methods, are explored for their potential to enhance efficiency and sustainability in vitamin recovery. Their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-boosting properties make microalgal vitamins valuable tools for addressing global nutritional deficiencies and improving overall health. Despite significant progress, challenges persist, including high production costs, scalability issues, and regulatory concerns. The review emphasizes the importance of developing cost-effective farming systems, advanced genetic engineering, and modern extraction technologies, and suggests directions for future research. Vitamins from microalgae hold great potential for transforming the global nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries, fostering innovation, creating revenue opportunities, and promoting a more sustainable and eco-friendly future.",

    "Abstract": "Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a major concern in medication safety. Although advanced artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning have improved DDI prediction, their adoption is limited by the need for specialized expertise and complex model development. This study introduces the first application of the AutoGluon AutoML framework to DDI prediction using molecular features, aiming to automate and simplify model development. A curated subset of 100,000 drug pairs from DrugBank was used, employing three molecular representations: 2D molecular descriptors, 2048-bit Morgan fingerprints, and their combination. Models were trained using AutoGluon-Tabular with no manual hyperparameter tuning. The descriptor-only model achieved the best performance, with 84.4% test accuracy and an AUC of 0.916, outperforming fingerprint-based and hybrid models. Feature importance analysis identified key physicochemical and topological descriptors-such as drug-likeness, electrotopological indices, and hydrophobic surface area-as critical predictors of DDIs. These results demonstrate that AutoML can extract chemically meaningful patterns while reducing technical barriers. Overall, our results validate AutoGluon as a scalable approach to DDI prediction that provides chemically meaningful, feature-level interpretability, and lay the groundwork for future applications involving larger datasets and more complex chemical representations.",

    "Abstract": "This review paper examines how natural fiber nano-fillers reinforced epoxy composites offer a viable solution to mitigate environmental impacts while enhancing the mechanical strength of the polymer matrix. Natural fibers, chemical treatments, types of polymers, polymer composites, mechanical properties and increment in mechanical strength with the addition of nano fillers are discussed in this review. Further, applications of natural fiber polymer composites in numerous commercial sectors are discussed. It is concluded that the natural fiber type, chemical treatment, matrix material, nano or natural filler addition and percentage ratio of natural fiber, matrix materials and fillers affect the mechanical properties of composites. Moreover, this review critically identifies the existing research gaps in natural fiber reinforced epoxy composites incorporating nano-scaled fillers, particularly concerning dispersion, size of nano fillers, percentage ratio in matrix, interfacial bonding, and agglomeration. Future research is advised to overcome these obstacles so that nano fillers pave the way for their expansion into a wide range of natural fiber composites applications.",

    "Abstract": "<i>Morus</i> plants are globally recognized as essential economic woody species. Investigating cross-kingdom interaction mechanisms between <i>Morus</i> and endophytes, along with the regulatory networks of secondary metabolism, is crucial for sustainable agricultural development and innovative drug research. However, systematic analyses remain lacking. The variations in endophytic communities across different mulberry species, varieties, and tissues have not been fully elucidated. This review systematically reviewed the diverse characteristics of endophytes in <i>Morus</i> plants and the biological activities of their secondary metabolites, with particular emphasis on the co-evolution mechanisms between endophytes and their hosts. It was demonstrated that the endophytic communities in <i>Morus</i> plants exhibited significant species-specific differences, tissue specificity, and cultivar dependence. These endophytic communities enhance host nutrient utilization efficiency and promote plant growth through metabolic reciprocity, primarily via nitrogen fixation and phosphorus solubilization. Furthermore, they directly synthesize bioactive metabolites (such as flavonoids and alkaloids) while functioning as biological elicitors that activate host secondary metabolic pathways, thereby facilitating secondary metabolites accumulation. Additionally, endophytes were observed to improve host stress resistance by enhancing photosynthetic efficiency, maintaining ion homeostasis, and regulating soil nutrients. Hairy root cultures facilitate industrial-scale production of secondary metabolites from <i>Morus</i> plants through efficient biosynthesis platforms. This review established a theoretical foundation for in-depth analyses of plant-microbe cross-kingdom interaction networks and the development of targeted regulation technologies. Future research should prioritize investigations into dynamic metabolic interaction mechanisms and ecological safety assessments of engineered strains.",

    "Abstract": "Non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) gas sensors have the disadvantage of high limit of detection (LOD), and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) has a significant impact on LOD. This paper proposes the application of matched filtering to NDIR gas sensors, a weak signal detection method that maximizes the SNR, improving the LOD. Experimental results show that matched filtering outperforms traditional methods, achieving an LOD of 1.131 ppm, while the LOD based on lock-in amplification is 7.350 ppm. The full-scale relative error and relative standard deviation (RSD) of the sensor in detecting different gas concentrations were optimized and improved. This approach provides a significant algorithmic improvement in the detection accuracy of NDIR gas sensors, offering potential for the detection of gases with less prominent absorption peaks, such as hydrogen.",

    "Abstract": "Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is associated with significant interpersonal difficulties, yet little is known about how individuals with SAD experience sexual interactions. The current study examined the emotional consequences of sexual interactions among individuals with and without SAD, using a 21-day daily diary design. Participants were 108 single young adults (54 with SAD; 54 without), all of whom were not in a romantic relationship. Participants reported daily on their sexual interactions and emotional experiences. We found no significant differences in the number of sexual interactions between individuals with and without SAD as well as when social anxiety was examined as a continuum of severity. However, for individuals without SAD, sexual interactions were followed by higher levels positive emotions, whereas for individuals with SAD, no such emotional benefit was observed (and this remained when examining social anxiety as a continuum of severity). Finally, we found differences in the experience of negative emotions following sex between individuals with and without SAD, but those were not found when social anxiety was examined as a continuum. Implications for research and treatment of SAD are discussed.",

    "Abstract": "The discovery of antibiotics marked a crucial milestone in medical history, widely credited for its pivotal role in saving countless lives. However, the escalating resistance of microbes to traditional antimicrobial drugs (antibiotics) now jeopardizes the effectiveness of these life-saving drugs. The World Health Organization adopted a Global Action Plan (GAP) in 2015, recognizing the looming threat to human health posed by antimicrobial resistance (AMR). As of 2019, 4.95 million global deaths are attributed to AMR, with 1.27 million deaths recorded in that year alone. In this review, a thorough literature survey was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science using keywords related to AMR, antibiotic action, the mechanisms of AMR, and treatment of AMR. There was a primary focus on alternative therapies and innovative medicinal advancements, such as bacteriophage therapy, antimicrobial peptides, probiotics, and synthetic inhibitors for ppGpp nucleotide messengers as potential treatment options to reduce our dependence on antibiotics. These innovative strategies broaden the currently limited scope of treatments against the emerging resistant strains of microorganisms.",

    "Abstract": "The launch of the ICESat-2 and GEDI spaceborne LiDAR missions has provided new opportunities for large-scale estimation of mangrove aboveground biomass density (AGBD); however, their footprint-scale performance remains unclear. This study evaluated and compared the performance of AGBD estimation models based on ICESat-2 and GEDI data from mangrove ecosystems. First, we examine the effects of different feature categories on model accuracy. Next, we compared the performance of Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Multilayer Perceptron in constructing the AGBD estimation frameworks. Finally, we assessed the estimation accuracies of the ICESat-2 and GEDI under different observation scenarios, including day/night and strong/weak beams. The results indicate that the combination of height, canopy coverage, and topographic features improves the ICESat-2 AGBD estimates, whereas height and topographic features enhance the GEDI estimates. Among all algorithms, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy (ICESat-2: R² = 0.71; GEDI: R² = 0.73). Under nighttime strong-beam conditions, the ICESat-2 and GEDI both achieved high accuracies (ICESat-2: R² = 0.80; GEDI: R² = 0.76). Considering the denser sampling of the GEDI, large-scale AGBD mapping is recommended. Overall, this study highlighted the potential of the ICESat-2and GEDI for mangrove biomass monitoring.",

    "Abstract": "Mentalization theory (MT) is an influential theoretical framework with deficits in mentalizing hypothesised to be a key transdiagnostic factor in the development and treatment of various psychopathologies. While studies of externalising disorders in adults generally support this hypothesis, less is known about how mentalization relates to internalising disorders in children and adolescents. This rapid scoping review aims to evaluate whether, in child and adolescent populations, there is evidence of an inverse correlation between mentalizing ability – operationalised as Reflective Functioning – and internalising symptoms i.e., whether better reflective functioning is associated with fewer symptoms. A total of 490 peer-reviewed publications were screened, with 22 studies included. Eight studies found evidence of an inverse correlation, where better Reflective Functioning was associated with fewer internalising symptoms. Six studies yielded mixed or unclear results, whereas eight studies produced findings that did not align with the theoretical prediction, showing either null or reverse findings. Taken together, the available research provides largely inconclusive evidence for an inverse correlation between mentalizing and internalising symptoms in children and adolescents, with the overall pattern suggesting limited support for a consistent association. Possible explanations, both methodologically and theoretically, are discussed. Further research is needed to elucidate the relationship between mentalization ability and internalising symptoms.",

    "Abstract": "Acidic industrial wastewater requires effective pH adjustment prior to discharge or reuse. The use of unground biomass ash as a geopolymer binder offers potential benefits in reducing processing energy and costs while promoting industrial waste utilisation. This study investigates geopolymer binders produced from unground palm oil fuel ash and fly ash for wastewater acidity reduction. Geopolymer mortars were synthesised using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) concentrations of 10–16 M, cured at 65°C for 24 h, and air cured. Compressive strength was evaluated at 3, 14, 28, and 56 days. Acid neutralisation performance was assessed by immersing geopolymer specimens in hydrochloric acid (HCl) with an initial pH of 3, including a single-cycle test at 28 days and repeated exposure over 15 cycles with pH measured after 24 h. Results showed that compressive strength increased with NaOH concentration up to 14 M but slightly declined at 16 M. The acidic solution pH increased above 9 within 24 h, with the 14 M mixture exhibiting the highest neutralisation efficiency. Although pH gradually decreased over cycles, geopolymer mortars consistently maintained alkaline conditions and outperformed conventional cement mortar under repeated acidic exposure. The use of unground palm oil fuel ash eliminates grinding and reduces energy consumption.",

This study integrates geospatial techniques (optimized Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) and weighted overlay analysis) with multi-source habitat variables (climate, soil, vegetation) to map current and future habitat suitability and migration pathways. Future climate projections were generated using the BCC-CSM2-MR climate model. Key findings: (1) The MaxEnt model achieved robust performance (AUC > 0.93, TSS > 0.70), with precipitation seasonality, isothermality, and elevation as dominant drivers. (2) Projections indicate climate change will expand suitable habitats for the two locust species, moderate-high suitability areas in L. migratoria migratoria and low-moderate zones in C. italicus will progressively shrink under future climates. (3) Four and six potential migration pathways were identified for L. migratoria migratoria and C. italicus, concentrated along the Irtysh/Ili Rivers, Balkhash/Alakol Lakes, and Tianshan northern slopes. (4) Future scenarios predict corridor shortening and southward shifts, with SSP585 intensifying L. migratoria migratoria habitat fragmentation. Spatial overlap occurs in Irtysh River and Alakol Lake regions, highlighting cross-border monitoring priorities. These results provide geospatial evidence for optimizing early-warning systems and transboundary pest management strategies under climate change scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "In the era of new media, social media platforms have become crucial venues for disseminating public event information and forming public opinion, with insufficient analysis of public opinion evolution on short-video-based social media platforms. Taking the major public emergency event ‘2023 Hebei Floods, China’ on TikTok as an example, this study employs the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm to extract hot topics of public opinion to reveal the focus of public attention. Based on combining three-layer prompt learning templates and deep learning, a Prompt-BERT-TextCNN sentiment classification model with multi-level feature fusion is used to explore public opinion's hot topics and sentiments at different stages. Empirical evidence demonstrates that the LDA model categorizes the discourse into four primary thematic clusters. Concurrently, the Prompt-BERT-TextCNN model has exhibited reliable performance in sentiment analysis, achieving an accuracy rate of 0.901 and an F1 score of 0.899. These metrics underscore the model's effective capability in sentiment recognition, rendering it a potent tool for discerning the sentiment trend of textual data. The findings provide scientific evidence for supervisory authorities and supporting organizations to implement differentiated and timely public opinion management based on the thematic hotspots and sentiment characteristics at different stages of public emergency events.",

    "Abstract": "Assessment of risk factors of breast cancer in the general population provides insightful information towards prevention of breast cancer. This study aimed to assess the risk factors of breast cancer among women in a community from a resource-limited setting in sub-Saharan Africa. This descriptive community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Dodoma, Tanzania, from July to December 2020. The study included women aged between 18 and 70 years. The data were analyzed using SPSS program version 25.0. Independent <i>t</i>-test was used to compare the mean age of the participants for the availability of risk factors of breast cancer. A two-tailed <i>p</i> < 0.05 was considered significant. A total of 354 women were analyzed, and the median age was 27.0 (23.0-35.3) years. Only 11.8% (<i>n</i> = 18) of all the participants did not have any of the risk factors examined. Not engaging in physical activity was the most frequent risk factor which accounted for 68.2% (<i>n</i> = 242) of all the participants. There were more 60.7% (<i>n</i> = 215) of the study participants with a low mean age (22.9 ± 3.5) who had more than 5 risk factors compared to 39.3% (<i>n</i> = 139) of the participants with a high mean age (25.3 ± 9.4) who had more than 5 risk factors, with no statistically significant difference (95% CI = 0.91-2.22, <i>p</i> = 0.31). There is a large proportion of women younger than 40 years in the population of Tanzanian women with many risk factors of breast cancer. This may contribute to the currently observed increase in the incidence of breast cancer in Tanzania for women aged less than 40 years. Therefore, there is an urgency for targeted awareness and screening for breast cancer among younger women in Tanzania so as to increase early detection and diagnosis.",

    "Abstract": "Spontaneous fermentation is a key stage in cocoa processing, during which the main flavor and aroma precursor compounds are formed as a result of microbial activity. This study provides the first integrated characterization of microbial diversity and associated biochemical properties during the spontaneous fermentation of fine-aroma cocoa in the Amazonas region of northern Peru. Using culture-dependent methods combined with DNA barcoding, a dynamic community of bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi was identified, with a total of 79 microbial species detected across 144 h of fermentation. Microbial diversity was highest during the early stages of the process (12–48 h), with Shannon index values ranging from 3.02 to 3.08; it gradually declined as temperature increased from 26 to 55 °C and pH decreased from 4.79 to 3.59. Biochemical characterization based on carbohydrate assimilation, ethanol tolerance, and pectinolytic activity allowed the identification of a select group of native microorganisms with high potential for use as starter cultures. Overall, these results provide a scientific basis for the development of locally adapted starter cultures aimed at improving the efficiency, consistency, and quality of the fermentation process in fine-aroma cocoa and chocolate production.",

    "Abstract": "This article examines Pepe (Nelson Carlo De Los Santos Arias, 2024) as an experiment in non-human representation and cinematic form. Rejecting conventional narrative and documentary forms, the film resists rendering the ‘cocaine hippo’ legible within frameworks of empathy, allegory, or mastery. Drawing on the concept of right to opacity, response-ability, and posthuman assemblage, I argue that Pepe enacts a politics of refusal that is both aesthetic and ethical. Through fragmented temporality, haptic visuality, and polyphonic voiceover, the film dislocates subjectivity across species, histories, and geographies, disorienting the spectator without offering resolution or closure. Instead of casting the hippo as a symbol or victim, the film sustains his spectral presence, maintaining a deliberate obscurity that exceeds comprehension or possession. Pepe challenges colonial and anthropocentric demands for transparency, aligning with a broader lineage of experimental cinema that unsettles the politics of visibility. This refusal of clarity is not the absence of meaning but an invitation to remain with non-human life in its unresolved material and ethical complexity.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the determinants of microcredit utilisation among smallholder farmers in the Morogoro region of Tanzania, where challenges in accessing and effectively using microcredit limit agricultural productivity and household livelihoods. Using a mixed-methods approach with cross-sectional data from 240 smallholder farmers, the study explores socio-economic and institutional factors that influence microcredit use. Results show that microcredit utilisation is influenced by sex of smallholder farmers, education, household size, loan amount, farm size, decision-making authority, income diversification and asset ownership, while microcredit fungibility, inadequate loan sizes and limited financial literacy undermine optimal use. These findings highlight that microcredit alone is insufficient; complementary interventions such as financial literacy programmes, customised loan products and stronger institutional support are essential. Strengthening these mechanisms can improve microcredit effectiveness, enhance agricultural productivity and support rural development.",

Facing challenges of language barriers and cultural differences in TCM communication, the model integrates TCM professional education with Chinese language training to cultivate localized talents proficient in both TCM practice and cross-cultural communication. Findings reveal that the model, featuring a 5–6-year curriculum with 25%–30% Chinese language credits and HSK Level 5 requirements, has effectively addressed terminological translation issues and improved clinical communication efficiency. Supported by Thai policies and Sino-Thai academic collaboration, the model has fostered 2194 registered TCM practitioners and a nationwide service network by 2024. It demonstrates that integrating professional competence, language proficiency, and cultural understanding can transform TCM from a “Chinese experience” to a “global solution,” providing a paradigm for international TCM education and cultural soft power enhancement.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Histone H1 and related linker histones play critical roles in chromosome organization in eukaryotic cells. Although histone H1 is essential for compacting nucleosomes into chromatin fibers and is a major structural component of chromosomes, its association with chromatin is highly dynamic. Histone H1 exchange modulates the accessibility of regulatory proteins to DNA and has been implicated in the regulation of gene expression and cellular pluripotency. Relatively little is known, however, about how histone H1 binding, exchange and function is regulated in vivo. In this study, we investigated the regulation of histone H1 function in Drosophila using live analysis and confocal microscopy. A gain-of-function genetic screen identified several factors that affect chromosome structure, histone H1 binding or histone H1 exchange, including the ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factor XNP, the hypoxia-induced factor Scylla, the winged helix transcription factor Jumeau and the microRNA bantam. Our findings show that altered expression of single factors can have surprisingly global effects on higher-order chromatin structure and histone H1 binding in vivo, with the potential to trigger large scale changes in genome organization and accessibility.",

    "Abstract": "Precise regulation of chromatin structure is essential for ensuring genome stability and cellular function. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the YEATS (Yaf9-ENL-AF9-Taf14-Sas5) domain protein Yaf9 is a shared component of the NuA4 acetyltransferase and the SWR1 chromatin remodelling complexes. We investigated the function of Yaf9 and discovered that it becomes essential for survival when histone H4 acetylation is impaired. The loss of Yaf9 in a strain with impaired H4 acetylation led to cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase and activation of the homologous recombination pathway. This synthetic lethality was not recapitulated by inactivating the Yaf9 YEATS domain, suggesting that it is independent of Yaf9's ability to recognise acyl-modified lysine residues. We also found that Yaf9 was required in both NuA4 and SWR1 complexes to ensure cell viability in the absence of H4 acetylation. Together, these findings reveal a compensatory relationship between Yaf9 and histone H4 acetylation, suggesting that Yaf9 acts as a functional link between chromatin remodelling and histone modification pathways to maintain genome integrity under conditions of chromatin stress.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction Green spaces are increasingly recognized as critical to public health. This study examines English local planning authorities’ green infrastructure strategies, evaluating how health improvement and inequality reduction goals are integrated. Methods A quantitative content analysis was conducted on publicly accessible green infrastructure strategy documents. Of 305 potential authorities, 133 (44%) were included based on eligibility criteria. Only strategies published from 2012 onwards were included. Data were coded across themes: health policy and actors, health outcomes, demographics and inequalities, environmental change and health. A scoring system quantified consideration of health and inequality, with descriptive statistics summarizing thematic presence, frequency, regional variation, and temporal trends. Results The integration of health and inequality varied substantially. Most strategies referenced general health outcomes, but fewer detailed actions targeting health inequalities or specific demographic groups. Regional differences were observed, and methods for monitoring health impacts were limited. Conclusion Local green infrastructure strategies in England increasingly recognize their health improvement potential, but inconsistent integration of health and inequality may limit impact. Stronger collaboration between planning and public health is needed to create equitable, accessible, health-promoting environments. Future research should explore longitudinal health impacts and identify best practices for integrating health equity in spatial planning.",

The widespread availability and the accessibility of guns-and their uniquely lethal risks-make gun violence a devastating national problem. Given that social workers deliver services in many settings where clients face high risk of gun violence victimization and perpetration, social work professional values, commitments, and perspectives afford a special responsibility and opportunity to work to reduce gun violence in the United States. In this article, authors overview the problem of gun violence in the United States and its legal backdrop, and then highlight some of the emerging knowledge regarding how social workers can assess and intervene to prevent gun violence to save lives, promote physical and mental well-being, advance social equity, and strengthen communities.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Pre‐implantation embryonic loss constitutes a major barrier to reproductive efficiency in livestock, yet the extrinsic determinants of embryonic survival remain poorly defined. Intra‐organoid fluid (IOF) faithfully recapitulates native tissue secretions across multiple organ systems. We hypothesized that bovine endometrial epithelial organoids (BEEO) would produce IOF that mirrored in vivo uterine luminal fluid composition and extend embryo culture duration in vitro. We pursued three objectives: (a) establish and morphologically characterize BEEO, (b) define BEEO transcriptomic and secretory responses to 17β‐estradiol (E2), medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), and interferon‐tau (IFNτ), and (c) determine whether BEEO‐derived IOF can support in vitro embryonic development beyond Day 8 (hatched blastocyst stage) under conventional culture conditions. BEEO were established from primary endometrial tissue ( n = 4) and maintained a stable epithelial phenotype through multiple passages. Transcriptomic profiling revealed robust responses to stimulation, with E2, MPA, and IFNτ inducing distinct gene expression programs consistent with in vivo effects. IOF metabolomic analysis confirmed hormone‐dependent regulation of IOF secretory output, with E2 + MPA (diestrus mimic) enhancing the production of metabolites implicated in conceptus development. Remarkably, IOF from diestrus mimic‐stimulated BEEO, despite being diluted approximately seven‐fold in PBS, maintained embryo survival rates comparable to optimized commercial medium and exceeded PBS‐only controls. These findings position BEEO as a physiologically relevant model for dissecting maternal‐embryo interactions in vitro and identifying targets to improve fertility in cattle and other livestock.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This study aims to develop a novel therapeutic strategy for osteoporosis (OP) by enhancing the osteogenic differentiation potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). A three‐channel biomimetic bone organ‐on‐a‐chip model was constructed. Through bioinformatics analysis, TPD52L1 , a key upregulated gene involved in the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, was identified. Molecular experiments were conducted to verify the effects of its overexpression on the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway. Critically, systematic knockdown experiments were performed to validate its necessity in mechanotransduction. Subsequently, functional experiments were performed to evaluate its role in the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of MSCs in a GIOP model. Safety assessments for TPD52L1‐ overexpressing MSCs covered subcellular localization, proliferation, anchorage‐independent growth, oncogene expression, and short‐term in vivo tumorigenicity. TPD52L1 overexpression activated the Wnt/β‐catenin pathway and promoted osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. Its knockdown blocked mechanical stimulation‐induced pathway activation and osteogenic marker upregulation, confirming its necessity in mechano‐osteogenic conversion. TPD52L1 upregulated osteoblast markers osteocalcin (OCN) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), downregulated the osteoclast marker tartrate‐resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), and reversed the osteoporosis phenotype. When combined with cyclic mechanical force stimulation in the organ‐on‐a‐chip system, a synergistic effect was observed, enhancing bone repair. TPD52L1 was localized in the cytoplasm, and its endogenous expression was upregulated by mechanical stimulation, indicating mechanosensitivity. TPD52L1 overexpression did not affect MSCs' proliferation, anchorage‐independent growth, or oncogene expression. Subcutaneous transplantation experiments confirmed that it did not induce tumor formation or significant pathological changes, demonstrating favorable biosafety. TPD52L1 serves as a key target for promoting the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Cholesterol lowering through diet, lifestyle, and pharmacologic therapy remains central for limiting atherosclerosis and prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events. Yet, 33%–50% of individuals on lipid‐lowering therapy continue to exhibit elevated inflammation. Middle age (MA) represents a critical window for disease acceleration, underscoring a need to better understand nonresolving inflammation in this time frame. Here, we rendered young (2 months) and MA mice (10 months) hypercholesterolemic with an AAV8‐PCSK9 virus and western diet (WD). Following 20 weeks on WD, mice were switched to a chow diet for 6 weeks to induce lipid lowering. This design models dietary cholesterol reduction to dissect lipid‐driven versus inflammation‐driven pathways in atherosclerosis. At baseline atherosclerosis, we found that MA mice had increased plaque necrosis as well as increased circulating and bone marrow PMN compared to young mice. After chow switch, unlike in young mice, MA mice had increased plaque necrosis and reduced remodeling, as well as increased circulating white blood cells and bone marrow hematopoietic stem cell progenitors (HSPCs). In MA chow‐switched mice, circulating neutrophils correlated with necrosis whereas young mice exhibited no correlation. Furthermore, MA atherosclerotic mice had bone marrow HSPCs and neutrophils that exhibited a more activated phenotype relative to young after chow switch. In addition, we observed elevated neutrophil–endothelial contacts in the hippocampal vasculature of MA mice after chow switch. While dietary intervention and lowered plasma cholesterol restrained atheroprogression in young, it was inadequate in MA mice, failing to reduce systemic inflammation and indicating the need for complementary therapies during this time frame.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Marked trabecular bone loss of the distal femoral and proximal tibial regions is one of the most common and devastating complications of spinal cord injury (SCI) with highest incidence of fracture and no efficacious treatment to date. Osteocytes exhibit increased transforming growth factor‐β (TGF‐β) signaling 5 weeks after SCI. Whether reducing TGF‐β signaling will restore trabecular bone structure after development of bone loss with SCI has not been tested. To address this, male mice underwent laminectomy (sham) or thoracic (T10) contusion SCI resulting in complete hindlimb paralysis. Five weeks later, sham and SCI mice received either control (IgG) or anti‐TGF‐β neutralizing (ID11) antibody (10 mg/kg/day, twice weekly) for 5 weeks before sacrifice. Micro‐computed tomography (micro‐CT) analysis of the distal femoral region showed that, compared to sham‐IgG animals, treatment with ID11 significantly ( p &lt; 0.05) restored trabecular fractional bone volume (107% SCI‐ID11 vs. 65% SCI‐IgG), thickness (109% SCI‐ID11 vs. 88% SCI‐IgG), connectivity (99% SCI‐ID11 vs. 78% SCI‐IgG), and structure model index (101% SCI‐ID11 vs. 118% SCI‐IgG). In contrast, analysis of femoral mid‐shaft regions showed that both SCI‐1D11 and SCI‐IgG mice exhibited reduced cortical thickness (91% vs. 84%). Histomorphometric analysis revealed no differences in indices of osteoblast or osteoclast numbers or surfaces between SCI‐IgG, SCI‐1D11, and sham‐IgG groups. Similarly, analysis of femoral bone marrow supernatants demonstrated no significant difference in levels of procollagen type 1 intact N‐terminal propeptide (P1NP) or tartrate‐resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRAcP‐5b). Thus, TGF‐β signaling may be a promising therapeutic target to regain trabecular bone architecture and prevent fractures after SCI.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Although immunotherapy has shown promise in improving outcomes for bladder cancer (BCa) patients, treatment responses remain highly variable. A comparative examination of the tumor microenvironment (TME) between responders and non‐responders may reveal key resistance mechanisms and identify potential therapeutic targets. We integrated spatial transcriptomics, single‐cell RNA sequencing, and multiplexed immunofluorescence to characterize spatial structures within the TME that influence response to anti‐PD‐1 therapy in BCa patients. In non‐responders, we observed an accumulation of stem‐like malignant epithelial cells with high MYBL2 expression near the tumor boundary. Furthermore, we identified a spatial triad structure—composed of SPP1 + tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs), POSTN + cancer‐associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and endothelial cells—located at the tumor periphery. This structure was associated with T‐cell exclusion and reduced efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade. In a preclinical model, inhibiting SPP1 enhanced the response to anti‐PD‐1 therapy, resulting in reduced CAF infiltration and increased recruitment of cytotoxic T cells. Our study reveals a triad cellular structure mediated by SPP1 + TAMs, POSTN + CAFs, and endothelial cells that contribute to immunotherapy resistance in BCa. Targeting this structure, particularly through SPP1 blockade, represents a promising strategy to augment the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to introduce and evaluate two brief screening instruments for autism in Brazil. Initial data on reliability, validity, norms and proposed cutoff scores are presented. Design/methodology/approach Each brief scale was completed by 700 independent participants, gathered as a convenience sample. The mean age of participants completing the Brief Screening for Autism Spectrum (Brief-Spec) A was 37.6 years (SD = 11.7) with balanced gender distribution (50.0% male); Brief-Spec F had a mean age of 40.3 years (SD = 10.3). Most participants had college or postgraduate degrees. Data were collected online, with informed consent obtained. Psychometric evaluation included confirmatory factor analysis, ordinal alpha and omega estimates, and correlations with Autism Spectrum Quotient-10 scores. Findings Both tools demonstrated strong structural validity and high reliability. Brief-Spec A showed acceptable fit (CFI = 0.915, TLI = 0.903, RMSEA = 0.085, SRMR = 0.048; α = 0.87 – 0.90, ω = 0.84 – 0.89). Brief-Spec F also showed acceptable fit (CFI = 0.922, TLI = 0.907, RMSEA = 0.098, SRMR = 0.067; α = 0.82–0.93, ω = 0.82 – 0.90). Both showed substantial convergent validity and practical cutoff scores. Research limitations/implications Both instruments are efficient, reliable and sensitive screening tools for Brazilian adults, with sensitivity to sex and gender differences. Practical implications These instruments offer practical benefits for rapid, reliable, autism screening in adults and carry important social implications by supporting earlier identification and reducing diagnostic inequities. Originality/value This study introduces the first brief, psychometrically robust autism screening tools specifically developed and validated for Brazilian adults, thus addressing a critical gap in culturally adapted assessment resources. By providing separate versions that are sensitive to sex- and gender-related differences, the instruments have the potential to improve diagnostic equity and inclusivity. The brevity of the instruments, combined with strong reliability, supports practical use across diverse contexts, including primary care, community programs and large-scale surveys. In addition, the provision of normative data and preliminary cutoff scores facilitates application in both clinical and research contexts, supporting earlier identification, improved access to appropriate follow-up, and responsiveness to intervention.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Co-design aims to strengthen design outcomes by meaningfully engaging users in design processes. To enhance architectural accessibility, there is increased interest in engaging people with disability in co-design processes. However, little is known about how co-design is implemented in the design of large-scale public buildings, what outcomes are achieved and what factors influence the meaningful participation of people with disability in architectural co-design. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative approach was employed to explore stakeholder perspectives on a co-design initiative undertaken to enhance the universal design of a civic precinct in Australia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine participants – five architects, three City Council employees and one Council Access and Inclusion Advisory Committee member. Data were analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. This approach identified key themes that encapsulated participants’ experiences and perceptions of co-design with people with disability to enhance the universal design of a public building. Findings Four overarching themes were identified from the analysis: (1) Co-design is shaped by those involved; (2) Co-design must be meaningful and inclusive; (3) Co-design and universal design must be prioritised throughout design stages; and (4) Co-design leads to improved design and capacity building. Originality/value This study contributes new knowledge about the practice of co-design in the context of large-scale public architecture. It provides valuable insight into the experiences of architects, people with disability and local government stakeholders, revealing both the complexities and potential of inclusive co-design. Findings also suggest a reciprocal relationship between universal design and co-design whereby application of one approach may strengthen application of the other.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This article aims to improve the centrifugal pump’s head performance and hydraulic efficiency through the application of an integrated multi-objective optimization (MOO) approach. Optimization of impeller design parameters seeks to enhance operating efficiency and increase the pump’s operating range in terms of changing flow rates. Design/methodology/approach The suggested methodology combined computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, surrogate modeling, and Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). Three geometric parameters (outlet width, blade outlet angle and wrap angle) were systematically varied. In order to accurately forecast pump performance, radial basis function (RBF) networks and linear regression surrogate models have been developed. Subsequently, NSGA-II was utilized for MOO targeting improvements in head and hydraulic efficiency. Two optimization strategies have been implemented: one focus on best efficiency point and the second on different flow ranges. Findings The first optimization approach resulted in improvements of 4.39% in head and 5.94% in hydraulic efficiency at BEP. The second optimization process enhanced head performance by 6.42% and efficiency by 7.63% and produced a steeper H-Q curve for uses where high control sensitivity of the flow is needed. The width of the impeller outlet was the controlling factor, while blade outlet angle had little effect in range of the test. Originality/value Using simulation coupled with efficient surrogate modeling techniques, it builds computationally efficient framework to reduce optimization time while preserving accuracy. It highlights the strong impact of impeller outlet width on pump performance and introduces a multi-optimization strategy to promote operational flexibility, providing significant insights and guidelines for designing superior turbomachinery.",

It also seeks to investigate the effects of integrating recycled aluminum soda cans as thermal energy storage media on system performance. Design/methodology/approach The proposed system comprises a rectangular wooden air duct equipped with transparent polymer side walls and a high-transmittance glass cover, operating under forced convection using an axial fan. Experimental investigations were carried out for three different configurations, namely an empty duct, a parallel arrangement and a crosswise arrangement of recycled water-filled aluminum cans, while three-dimensional CFD simulations were used to analyze internal airflow characteristics, temperature distribution and associated heat transfer behavior. Findings The designed solar air heater increased the indoor air temperature after continuous operation from noon to evening. Performance and efficiency improvements were achieved through black-coated absorber surfaces, aerodynamic duct optimization and the use of water-filled cans as thermal storage. Originality/value This study presents a novel combination of experimental testing and CFD-based analysis to evaluate a solar air heating system specifically designed for large indoor spaces, an area that has received limited attention in previous research.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study reinterprets a year-long Lesson Study dataset to examine how instructional vision is collaboratively co-constructed. Using a retrospective conjecture map and an operational matrix that links elements, mechanisms, and indicators, the theory of change is made explicit for tracing vision management across cycles. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative secondary analysis of an existing corpus (lesson plans, observation notes, videos, artefacts) from a one-year Lesson Study in a Japanese elementary classroom. The analysis preserves the original coding pipeline and aligns data excerpts with E/M/I identifiers. Findings Across four phases, collaborative construction and inclusive epistemic expectations primarily supported equitable talk moves (I1/I2); flexible adaptability enabled the relaxation of time-bounded rules (I2/I4); and role-switching routines widened entry points (I3). Mechanisms overlap and reconfigure rather than progress linearly, forming a mechanism-centred process model of teacher learning and vision evolution. Research limitations/implications A single-site, single-teacher case based on retrospective analysis provides existence-proof support for several observed links among elements, mechanisms, and indicators, while leaving others provisional for future testing. Findings are framed for analytic rather than statistical generalisation. Practical implications The contribution is procedure-level: teams can adapt routines (co-authored norms, paraphrasing before adding, time-bounded relaxations, rotated roles, and public criteria discussion) within local constraints to address the exact mechanisms and indicators. These serve as resources for co-design, not programme prescriptions. Social implications Making mechanisms for equitable participation visible and discussable can support inclusive classroom cultures through collaborative inquiry, without assuming uniform effects across sites.

    "Abstract": "Purpose Poverty significantly impacts the Muslim world’s social and economic development. Somalia, a country with a rich cultural heritage, is among the poorest nations in the world due to poverty. Hence, this study aims to investigate the crowdfunders’ behavioral intention to use the crowdfunding waqf model (CWM) as a financing mechanism for livestock sector and as a tool for poverty alleviation in Somalia. Design/methodology/approach The primary data for this paper were gathered from 205 respondents, mostly youth from several universities in the capital city of Mogadishu, through online questionnaires. Structural equation modeling with partial least squares was adopted to test the hypotheses. This paper adopted the technology acceptance model variables, along with the social media variable, to assess the crowd funder’s behavior. Findings This research found that both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use positively influence the behavioral intent of crowd donors to use the CWM for developing the livestock sector in Somalia. Furthermore, social media usage does not have a direct or positive influence on crowdfunders’ behavioral intentions to use CWM. Research limitations/implications Future studies may concentrate on the applicability of the CWM to other businesses or industries and incorporate new variables to increase CWM’s robustness. Originality/value This study presents a significant opportunity to increase awareness of the CWM’s role in raising waqf funds to support the livestock sector and promote poverty alleviation in Somalia.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Understanding volunteers’ motivations is crucial for enhancing the effectiveness of volunteering. While prior research has largely focused on other-oriented motivations, studies on self-oriented motivation remain limited and report conflicting findings. By integrating self-actualisation theory with the functional approach, this study proposes a moderated mediation model with double-edged effects to examine when and how self-oriented motivation influences voluntary behaviour in humanitarian non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Design/methodology/approach Regression analysis and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) were employed to analyse data collected from 426 Iranian NGO volunteers. Findings The results reveal double-edged effects. While self-oriented motives negatively influence voluntary behaviour, non-profit public service motivation (NPSM) partially mediated this relationship, producing a positive indirect effect. In addition, collectivism moderates these relationships by strengthening the link between self-oriented motivation and NPSM, while weakening its association with voluntary behaviour. Originality/value This study provides a novel perspective on self-oriented motivation by applying a moderated mediation framework that captures its complex and dual nature. The findings advance theoretical understanding of volunteer behaviour and offer practical insights for social service management, particularly in volunteer recruitment and retention strategies within NGOs.",

We propose that social trust is an important informal institution that promotes ethical behavior and accountability, leading corporate managers to produce clearer, more accessible annual reports for stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of 44,799 firm-year observations from 1,076 publicly listed US firms, we analyze the impact of regional social trust on the readability of financial reports. We further investigate how this relationship varies across different organizational and managerial characteristics, including stakeholder orientation, geographical dispersion, monitoring environments, managerial capabilities and chief executive officer (CEO) experience. Findings Our results provide strong evidence that firms located in regions with higher social trust produce less obfuscated financial reports. This negative relationship is more pronounced in firms with higher stakeholder orientation, lower geographical dispersion, stronger monitoring environments, more capable managers and CEOs with broader work experience (generalist CEOs). Practical implications The findings suggest that social trust is a significant driver of financial report readability.

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study examines women's entrepreneurship in Lebanon amid a prolonged crisis, exploring how individual motivations, relational networks and structural and socio-cultural barriers shape entrepreneurial agency. It highlights how women's ventures, often necessity-driven, sustain households, strengthen socio-economic resilience and promote relational, community-oriented and inclusive forms of leadership. Design/methodology/approach Grounded in institutional theory, the study draws on 20 in-depth semi-structured interviews with women entrepreneurs across diverse sectors in Lebanon to examine the institutional conditions that affect them, the leadership styles they enact and the socio-economic contributions they generate. A multi-level framework captures the interplay of micro-, meso- and macro-level dynamics, providing a basis for analyzing the challenges and opportunities that shape women's entrepreneurial trajectories. Findings This study finds that women's entrepreneurship in Lebanon is primarily driven by necessity and household responsibilities and affected by institutional collapse, limited resources and socio-cultural norms. Despite these constraints, their ventures provide vital safety nets, support livelihoods and reinforce community resilience. It also underlines that women enact leadership characterized by empathy, inclusivity and relational support. They rely on informal networks, adaptive strategies and improvisational learning to navigate systemic neglect, while making significant socio-economic contributions through job creation, household sustenance and the preservation of local markets. Originality/value This study situates women's entrepreneurship in a fragile crisis context, challenging trait-based and Western-centric models. It frames entrepreneurship as a gendered survival strategy rooted in necessity, responsibility and adaptation. By highlighting women's dual role as socio-economic providers and community leaders, the findings offer actionable insights for designing inclusive, context- and gender-sensitive policies to support women entrepreneurs in crisis settings.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Despite recent progress in target tracking control of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), achieving fast and effective tracking performance still faces challenges. To address this issue, this paper aims to design a distributed finite-time (FT) cooperative control method, which enables multiple USVs to track a target in FT with external disturbances. Design/methodology/approach By incorporating the position difference between the USV and the target as the system state in the USV model, an error system can be formed. Cooperative target tracking control can be achieved by driving these system states to zero. First, a Lyapunov function is constructed for each USV under the directed communication topology. Using the proposed controller, it is proven that all system states converge to zero in FT. Then, an event-triggered mechanism (ETM) with the control error term is incorporated, which reduces computing burden while maintaining the expected control performance. Finally, theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed event-triggered FT cooperative tracking controller can effectively achieve the purpose of this paper. Findings In the presence of nonlinear time-varying external disturbances, USVs are able to track the target in FT. Furthermore, the ETM effectively prevents Zeno behavior, demonstrating that the presented method can be applied to actual physical systems. Originality/value The proposed method, which ensures FT stability while guaranteeing Zeno-free, can be applied not only to USVs, but also to the control problems of other multi-agent systems, such as multiple unmanned aerial vehicles and multiple unmanned ground vehicles.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to examine how artificial-intelligence capabilities in business education catalyse green innovation (GI) and how those innovations translate into stronger sustainable performance (SP) and circular-economy (CE) outcomes. It also evaluates whether big-data analytics and knowledge-management systems strengthen the pathway from artificial-intelligence capability to GI. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through structured questionnaires from 712 participants occupying high-level academic and administrative positions across 25 universities in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. A two-wave, time-lagged design with approximately four weeks’ separation (Wave 1: AIC/big data analytics/KMS; Wave 2: GI/SP/CE) provided temporal and source separation. Analysis combined partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modelling (including PLSpredict for out-of-sample performance) and a cross-validated artificial neural network to capture potential non-linear effects. Findings Artificial-intelligence capability is positively associated with GI, and GI is linked to stronger SP and more circular economy practices. Big-data analytics and knowledge-management systems each amplify the influence of artificial-intelligence capability on GI, with moderation magnitudes best characterised as modest yet statistically significant (small f²) and practically meaningful in aggregate. Prediction tests indicate meaningful out-of-sample relevance, and the neural-network analysis corroborates the salience of data and knowledge infrastructures alongside GI in explaining sustainability outcomes. Research limitations/implications The design is cross-sectional at analysis despite time-lagged measurement and relies on self-reported assessments, which constrains causal inference. These concerns are mitigated through rigorous validity checks and prediction assessment. Future research should incorporate longitudinal designs, objective operational metrics and broader organisational contexts to verify and extend these relationships. Practical implications Business schools and university leaders seeking tangible sustainability gains should co-invest in artificial intelligence capabilities, enterprise-level analytics and knowledge management infrastructures, and explicitly channel these assets towards green process and product initiatives. Establishing cross-functional governance and dashboards that track CE indicators can accelerate impact and guide continuous improvement. Ethical guardrails (privacy, bias auditing and green-IT practices) are recommended to avoid unintended consequences. Originality/value The paper advances scholarship by linking artificial-intelligence capability to GI and downstream sustainability within business education, and by demonstrating that data and knowledge systems are critical first-stage contingencies. Methodologically, it integrates PLSpredict with neural networks to deliver prediction-validated evidence that is theoretically grounded and directly actionable for institutions seeking to pursue sustainability leadership. The study also maps HEI-specific sustainability dimensions to sustainable development goals to support audited, management-relevant reporting.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose Vibrating screens are widely used for material classification, but their core component – the exciter – can experience polarization phenomena under long-term cyclic loading. Such phenomena may accelerate structural deterioration, cause severe damage to the exciter, and ultimately lead to equipment failure. Therefore, accurate detection and characterization of polarization phenomena in vibrating screens are of great importance. Design/methodology/approach A column-type three-dimensional force sensor was developed to detect polarization phenomena in vibrating screens. Finite element simulations were carried out to examine the strain distribution characteristics under different dimensional conditions. The effects of axial slot length and alternative Wheatstone bridge configurations on the mechanical performance of the sensor were systematically investigated. Findings The results indicate that the optimal strain-zone bridge configuration can more effectively characterize the coupling interference among forces in different directions. Moreover, when the columnar structure is subjected to radial forces in arbitrary directions, its deformation trends remain highly consistent, while axial forces exert a uniform influence on the radial bridge outputs. These findings provide a theoretical basis for improving the decoupling performance of column-type sensors. Research limitations/implications The main limitation of this study is the absence of experimental validation. Nevertheless, the results derived from theoretical analysis can serve as a reasonable prediction and reference for future experimental outcomes. Originality/value This study introduces a novel column-type three-dimensional force sensor together with an optimized bridge configuration strategy for detecting polarization phenomena in vibrating screens. The proposed approach not only enables accurate monitoring of the exciter’s operating state but also offers new insights into the structural design of columnar elastic bodies, thereby contributing to the advancement of multidimensional force sensor technology under complex industrial conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study aims to improve the dynamic performance of multidimensional force sensors used in cutting force measurements. Conventional sensors often suffer from low intrinsic frequencies, poor damping ratios and limited bandwidths, which restrict their ability to capture dynamic forces accurately. Design/methodology/approach A dynamic compensation method based on the improved red-tailed hawk algorithm (IRTHA) is proposed. The algorithm uses sine–tent–cosine chaotic mapping to enhance population diversity and introduces a cosine-based transition factor with dynamic weights to balance exploration and exploitation. Enhanced gravity factors and hybrid perturbation strategies further strengthen global and local optimization. The method is validated through benchmark functions and dynamic calibration experiments of a 3D force sensor. Findings Results show that the IRTHA-based compensator significantly reduces overshoot and regulation time, improving both the dynamic response and measurement accuracy of the sensor. Originality/value This work presents a novel dynamic compensation framework integrating advanced chaotic mapping and adaptive search mechanisms. The proposed method offers superior optimization capability and provides an effective solution for enhancing the dynamic measurement performance of multidimensional force sensors.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Accurate and reliable estimation of wildlife population density is fundamental to effective conservation and management. While camera traps show potential for monitoring ground‐dwelling mammal densities, labour‐intensive data processing remains a significant constraint. Ideally, conservation efforts would benefit from the continuous monitoring of multiple species across broad spatial scales; however, the time and effort required for data processing make achieving this challenging. We developed the RAD‐REST (Random Encounter and Staying Time model Relying on All Detections) model, an extension of the Random Encounter and Staying Time model, to enable multi‐species density monitoring with substantially reduced effort. By explicitly modelling the probabilistic process of animals entering a predefined focal area, our model allows density estimation by analysing entry counts and staying times in only a subset of videos, while incorporating trapping rates from all video data. We also developed a user‐friendly R package ‘ctrest’ to implement the model's fully Bayesian framework, including estimation of activity levels. Using data from the Boso Peninsula, Japan, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations to determine the number of videos required to achieve (1) standard precision for density estimation (coefficient of variation, ) and (2) more stringent wildlife management standards (). The RAD‐REST model produced unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage rate. Although the original REST model showed superior precision, RAD‐REST model achieved acceptable estimation precision with dramatically reduced analytical effort. To reach acceptable values (≤0.35) using a 200‐camera array, most species (10 of 12) required analysing only 100 videos for entry counts and measuring staying times in videos with ≥1 entry (approximately 60%–70% of analysed videos). For higher precision (), a larger 400‐camera network was necessary, requiring analysis of 7.00% (single‐species) or 6.45% (multi‐species) of total expected videos (&gt;ca. 40,000 videos). Although precise estimates might still demand substantial effort, the RAD‐REST model enables cost‐effective monitoring by either supplementing photo‐trap arrays with a subset of video data or deploying dedicated video cameras across a portion of the network. This approach marks a critical advance towards large‐scale monitoring efforts, enabling more robust, multi‐species density estimation across diverse ecological contexts.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Ecological novelty is emerging rapidly due to global change drivers such as climate shifts, species introductions, defaunation, and land‐use transformation. These changes challenge how we assess, understand and manage ecosystems in the Anthropocene. We present an interdisciplinary framework for analysing the processes that generate novel ecosystems—across biotic and abiotic dimensions, and within their broader social context—rather than focusing solely on identifying novel communities or states. Through this framework, we gain an opportunity to identify ecosystems likely to develop novel properties in the future. The framework distinguishes among four key dimensions of novelty: compositional (species identity and community structure), functional (traits and ecosystem processes), abiotic (environmental conditions) and social (human interactions with, and perceptions of, nature). It accommodates variation in spatial and temporal scale, reference baselines and driver interactions. Our framework emphasises a multi‐process approach, covering different pathways for analysing and understanding many processes measured in a particular location. Designed to be both conceptually robust and operationalisable, the framework supports the development of metrics for monitoring, modelling and conservation decision‐making, applicable to both research and large‐scale ecosystem planning. We integrate perspectives from ecology, conservation biology, paleoecology, archaeology, global change science and the social sciences to guide the development of novel ecosystem research and philosophy. We finally illustrate its application in contexts such as refaunation, assisted migration and adaptive conservation planning. By focusing on novelty‐generating processes, our framework provides a shared foundation for researchers and practitioners to assess, anticipate and manage the emergence of novel ecosystems in an increasingly transformed biosphere.",

    "Abstract": "In the last decades, critical advancements in research technology and knowledge on disease mechanisms steered therapeutic approaches for chronic inflammatory diseases towards unprecedented target specificity. For allergic and chronic lung diseases, biologic drugs pioneered this goal, acquiring on the way-through the clinical use of monoclonal antibodies-a deeper understanding of how inflammatory and immune pathways are configured in disease-specific patterns. In this biomarker-driven approach, synthetic small molecule drugs (SMDs) were perceived as lagging behind in innovation for their relative lack of specificity. This was, however, mostly due to a shift in focus towards biologics rather than true obsolescence of SMDs. In the same timeframe, in fact, advances in structural biology and medicinal chemistry, bioinformatics and artificial intelligence held steadily SMDs' innovation and relevance. The use of kinase inhibitors, well established in the treatment of cancer and rheumatological diseases, is now approved for some allergic skin diseases and is approaching asthma and COPD with several clinical trials; moreover, new therapeutics targeting mast cell receptors and molecules involved in innate immunity are entering preclinical and clinical testing. Alongside, the portfolio of biologics is harboring the expansion of RNA therapeutics, which gained global recognition during the COVID-19 pandemic due to RNA vaccines. Different types of RNA therapeutics, including those based on different non-coding RNAs, are advancing to agency approval and market, thanks to improvements in molecule stability and delivery systems. In summary, the evidence presented in this position paper illustrates that precision medicine is becoming a goal shared between synthetic SMDs and biologics, both protein/antibody-based and RNA therapeutics. We review the current state, unmet needs and opportunities within this evolving landscape, highlighting how small molecular species, both synthetic as SMDs and biologic in nature as RNA, can contribute to the precision medicine approach along with protein and antibody-based biologics and cell therapies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This review summarizes the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying busulfan‐induced male infertility and evaluates the translational potential of current and emerging therapeutic strategies. Evidence indicates that busulfan induces germ cell DNA alkylation damage, triggers sustained oxidative stress, and activates multiple cell death pathways. These events are accompanied by supporting cell dysfunction, disruption of the blood–testis barrier (BTB), and endocrine imbalance, collectively driving progressive impairment of spermatogenesis. In response to these pathological processes, various interventions have been explored, including antioxidant molecules, natural extracts, epigenetic modulation, and stem cell–related approaches, many of which show partial improvement of spermatogenic function in experimental models. In addition, clinical strategies used for other forms of male infertility, such as gonadotropin supplementation and antioxidant supportive therapy, provide relevant reference frameworks for chemotherapy‐associated fertility impairment. However, most studies on busulfan‐induced infertility remain preclinical, and their benefits largely reflect supportive modulation of the testicular microenvironment rather than definitive restoration of spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) or repair of genotoxic damage. Based on an integrated assessment of current evidence, this review highlights key unresolved challenges, including the lack of a defined therapeutic safety window, limitations in targeted delivery, and difficulties in achieving fundamental reconstruction of the spermatogenic system. Accordingly, future studies should place greater emphasis on more effective isolation and protection of testicular tissue, development of targeted drug delivery systems, and strategies aimed at spermatogenic system reconstruction.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18F FDG PET) aids in assessing adrenal lesions, but variability in reporting and wide diagnostic standardised uptake value maximum (SUVmax) ranges hinder routine use. This study aimed to identify the utility of FDG_PET in guiding malignancy risk stratification and define diagnostic thresholds for FDG‐avid adrenal lesions. Methods A multi‐centre retrospective cohort study of adrenalectomies (2006–2024) was conducted. Of 1136 adrenalectomies, 138 had pre‐operative FDG‐PET. Clinicopathological and imaging data were reviewed. Imaging parameters, including unenhanced Hounsfield units (HU), SUVmax, SUVmean and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), were independently and blindly re‐reported. Results One hundred and four cases were included (53.8% male, median age 65, median lesion size 40 mm). Malignancy was confirmed in 65.4%. Mean SUVmax was 10.6 for malignant versus 4.7 for benign lesions ( p &lt; 0.001). An optimal SUVmax cut‐off of 5.63 yielded 75% sensitivity and a 19.4% false‐positive rate. In the sub‐analysis excluding histologically confirmed RCC lesions, sensitivity increased to 82.5% at a SUVmax of 11.7. Multivariate analysis identified SUVmax ≥ 5.63 (OR 6.0, CI [1.1–33.7], p = 0.004) as independently predictive of malignancy. Additional predictors included ROC HU ≥ 37 (OR 9.3, CI [1.8–47.2], p = 0.001), current practice HU ≥ 20 (OR 22.8, CI [1.3–41.0], p = 0.003), and &gt; 1 avid lesion (OR 5.4, CI [1.1–25.2], p = 0.003). Conclusion FDG‐PET is a useful diagnostic adjunct in undifferentiated adrenal lesions, with defined thresholds (SUVmax ≥ 5.63 and HU ≥ 20) guiding malignancy risk stratification. FDG‐PET should be considered in large, suspicious lesions or those with a history of malignancy.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The Central Nervous System (CNS), comprising the brain and the eye, is considered to have a ‘privileged’ mechanism for dealing with immunological challenge (immune privilege, IP). CNS IP has been revealed through experiments using foreign protein antigens and cell and tissue alloantigens (grafts), but evidence for a role for IP in modulating host–pathogen interactions in the CNS is limited. However, the low frequency of CNS infection in the face of widespread systemic exposure to CNS‐tropic infectious agents, together with the high incidence of CNS infection in immunocompromised individuals, suggests that in healthy individuals, the CNS has tightly controlled regulatory mechanisms to protect against infectious agents. Although the naïve healthy brain and retina parenchyma largely lack adaptive immune cells, their border tissues (meninges, uveal tract) contain a full complement of resident immune cells, including CNS‐specific regulatory T cells (Tregs), which have a fundamental role in controlling infection in the brain parenchyma. Tregs also underpin ocular IP, particularly of the neural retina. Recent studies report that Tregs are transcriptionally ‘customised’ to the CNS and function at a distance; that is, are located in niches/hubs around the venous sinuses of the border tissues. T cells resident in the uveal tract probably play a similar role. We propose that Tregs are key drivers of CNS IP and do so by promoting latency of infectious agents.",

    "Abstract": "Background and Purpose EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homologue 2) inhibitors are an emerging class of drugs that target epigenetic regulation. However, their efficacy in solid tumours has been limited, partly due to drug‐induced upregulation of fatty acid synthesis. Combining lipid metabolic modulation with EZH2 inhibition may offer a promising strategy to enhance antitumor activity. Experimental Approach We conducted a screen of clinically approved lipid‐lowering drugs to identify candidates that could enhance the efficacy of EZH2 inhibitors and found that fenofibrate significantly potentiated the antitumor effects of EZH2 inhibition. Mechanistic studies revealed that this synergistic effect was associated with the degradation of EZH2 protein. To uncover the underlying regulatory pathway, we performed mass spectrometry analysis, which identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM21 and the deubiquitinase OTUD4 as key mediators of fenofibrate‐induced EZH2 degradation. Key Results Fenofibrate significantly enhanced the antitumor effects of EZH2 inhibitors in melanoma, independent of its conventional lipid‐lowering function. TRIM21 and OTUD4 were identified as critical mediators of this synergistic effect. Fenofibrate disrupted the non‐canonical functions of EZH2 by promoting its destabilization, thereby exerting dual effects—inhibiting EZH2 enzymatic activity and accelerating its degradation. Combination therapy with fenofibrate and EZH2 inhibitors resulted in a potent synergistic suppression of tumour growth. Conclusions and Implications Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for fenofibrate in augmenting EZH2‐targeted therapy. This study provides a novel strategy to improve the efficacy of epigenetic therapies in cancer by combining EZH2 inhibitors with fenofibrate, offering potential clinical benefits for precision oncology.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background and Purpose Despite breakthroughs in immunotherapy and targeted therapies, chemotherapy remains indispensable in oncology. Experimental Approach This study seeks to pinpoint key pathways in doxorubicin (DOX)‐treated mouse hippocampus, utilising comprehensive transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, and validating the mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. Key Results Our multi‐omics investigation revealed that sustained DOX exposure induced significant down‐regulation of 5‐aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2) and its catalytic product 5‐aminolevulinic acid (5‐ALA) in the hippocampal region. ALAS2 deficiency was specific to hippocampal neurons, which were more sensitive to oxidative damage than astrocytes or microglia. In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that 5‐ALA administration or ALAS2 overexpression protected the brain from DOX‐induced neurotoxicity. ALAS2 catalyses the condensation of glycine and succinyl‐CoA to form 5‐ALA, the key precursor of haem. Beyond its role in erythropoiesis, haem is a metabolite that modulates cellular redox homeostasis through interactions with the BACH1 (BTB and CNC homology 1)/NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2) pathway. We found that DOX suppressed the ALAS2/5‐ALA axis, thereby enhancing BACH1 stability. This stabilised BACH1 competes with NRF2 for binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in target gene promoters. Conversely, reinforcing the ALAS2/5‐ALA axis elevated intracellular haem levels, promoting BACH1 degradation and enhancing NRF2 activity. Using a zebrafish model, we further highlighted the antioxidant and neuroprotective role of 5‐ALA against DOX‐induced neurotoxicity. Conclusions and Implications In conclusion, this study elucidates a novel endogenous neuroprotective mechanism wherein the ALAS2/5‐ALA axis modulates the BACH1/NRF2 pathway. 5‐ALA shows promise for repurposing to mitigate chemotherapy‐associated neurotoxicity.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Learners' engagement is crucial in educational achievement, especially in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learning, in which psychological sources and motivation are vital. Within the changing perspective of online teaching, maintaining students' engagement in AI‐supported settings offers mental difficulties and opportunities. Based on the Conservation of Resources (COR) theory and Positive Psychology (PP), the present research examines the effect of Psychological Capital (PsyCap) for predicting EFL students' engagement indirectly and directly by the mediating effect of ER. To this end, 328 college learners in China who had registered in AI‐supported EFL classes participated in the research. Data collection was done through valid self‐report tools and analysed utilising structural equation modelling to unravel the particular and general contributions of PsyCap and ER to students' engagement. The results revealed that both PsyCap and ER emerged as significant predictors of engagement, with ER being the strongest general predictor, uniquely accounting for 10.9% of the variance in engagement scores. Collectively, the general and specific factors explained 52.9% of the variance in engagement, underscoring the substantial role of psychological resources and ER in fostering students' engagement in AI‐supported EFL contexts. Moreover, a significant part of the relationship between PsyCap and engagement is shared by ER. The study offers theoretical contributions to the understanding of PsyCap within AI‐enhanced education and provides practical implications for designing interventions that support learner well‐being and motivation in digitally mediated EFL classrooms.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Teachers face significant occupational health challenges, particularly related to mental health. While interventions implemented in the workplace have demonstrated potential across different professions, their effectiveness for teachers remains understudied. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of workplace‐based mental health promotion programmes for teachers at all educational levels. Following PRISMA guidelines, 10 databases were systematically searched to identify relevant studies. Nineteen studies meeting inclusion criteria were analysed for intervention characteristics, outcomes and methodological quality. The review encompassed 2084 participants across diverse intervention types. Short‐duration interventions (≤ 30 days), particularly app‐based mindfulness and cognitive‐behavioural programmes, showed rapid improvements in mental health and well‐being. Yoga‐based interventions, despite short durations, demonstrated significant stress reduction when delivered intensively. Moderate‐duration interventions (31–90 days) generally provided more sustained benefits. Unexpectedly, low‐frequency classroom interventions and long‐duration programmes (&gt; 90 days) showed limited effectiveness in improving teachers' mental health. Findings suggest that short‐duration, high‐intensity programmes may be particularly effective and feasible in educational settings. However, significant heterogeneity in study designs and methodological quality limits definitive recommendations. Future research should prioritise standardised, high‐quality studies with longer follow‐up periods to build a robust evidence base for tailored effective mental health promotion programmes for teachers across various educational contexts.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This study, based on the social exchange theory, investigated the potential mechanisms of principals’ transformational leadership in teachers’ unethical professional behaviour. After collecting the data of 489 teachers in junior schools, we found that: (1) Perceived transformational principal has an indirect positive relationship with teachers’ unethical professional behaviour and this relationship is mediated by psychological empowerment. (2) School power distance negatively moderated the effect of perceived transformational principal on teachers’ psychological empowerment, which means that when the power distance was higher, the positive relationship of perceived transformational principal and teachers’ psychological empowerment would be weakened.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Driven by the escalating global emphasis on research impact, contemporary science policy has solidified around a valorisation imperative that increasingly treats knowledge as a strategic asset rather than a common heritage. This paper interrogates the ethical paradox that emerges as research outcomes are progressively viewed through the prism of economic utility, clashing with the foundational mission of science as a public good. By conceptualising publicly funded knowledge as a Polanyian fictitious commodity, the analysis deconstructs the institutional mechanisms that facilitate its disembedding from the social commons. Through a critical examination of two emblematic cases—the commercialisation of CRISPR gene‐editing and the technical enclosure of foundational AI—the inquiry reveals how pathways of legal and technical gatekeeping transform social resources into proprietary assets. Critically, it demonstrates that these valorisation regimes co‐produce systemic injustices, ranging from prohibitive price tags for essential therapies to the concentration of unaccountable digital power. In response to these structural failures, the paper proposes a normative framework wedding the principle of value pluralism with the procedural engine of Responsible Research and Innovation. By advancing these principles, it contributes to a critical reimagining of research valorisation, charting a principled course to better align scientific practice with its noble calling to serve the common weal.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Research has widely underscored the role and importance of students' inner variables in their learning process and academic outcomes. Two significant but less attended to constructs pertaining to primary school students are their senses of curiosity and creativity. There may be several driving forces triggering these factors among young English as a foreign language (EFL) learners. However, there is insufficient research on facilitative factors and specific activities that may foster the creation and maintenance of students' curiosity and creativity in primary school contexts. To fill the gap, drawing on a positive psychology (PP) perspective, this qualitative research invited 20 primary school EFL students, at K4–K6 levels, to an interview focusing on their perceptions. The findings of the thematic analysis demonstrated that different factors related to learners, teachers, materials, and context influenced the students' curiosity and creativity. The themes are discussed, and implications for EFL teachers, students, teacher educators, and policymakers are provided to encourage them to seek a pedagogy that cultivates creativity and curiosity. Insights for expanding theories related to learner psychology are also presented.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The impact of the COVID‐19 virus disproportionately affected U.S. Indigenous peoples, who experienced the highest infection and death rates in comparison with non‐Indigenous peoples. In this article, we use the framework of historical oppression, resilience, and transcendence (FHORT) to understand how Southeastern Indigenous peoples in the United States navigated hardships associated with the COVID‐19 global pandemic. This culturally congruent framework contextualizes imbalances found at individual, family, and community ecological levels, illustrating a direct correlation to sociopolitical, historical, and cultural oppression. This research assessed interconnections of structural inequity and associated disruptions to Indigenous wholistic wellness amid the pandemic. Thirty‐one community‐based, critical ethnographic interviews were conducted following an Indigenous toolkit for ethical and culturally sensitive research to understand quantitative risk factors associated with participant responses to COVID‐19. The following themes emerged: (a) racism, sexism, and discrimination; (b) increased trauma, financial stress, and violence; (c) physical symptoms; (d) impaired unity; and (e) disintegrated support and kinship networks. Risk factors associated with COVID‐19 emerged in large part from systemic inequity, incongruence between Indigenous family values and physical distancing protocols, and impaired collectivism. Future crisis interventions should promote traditional protective factors to offset the impact of historical oppression, consistent with the FHORT.",

    "Abstract": "Coenzyme A (CoA) is a vital cofactor involved in 8–10% of all metabolic reactions in human cells. Different inherited enzyme deficiencies in which the oxidation of acyl‐CoAs is hampered have been hypothesised to share a phenotype characterised by toxic accumulation of acyl‐CoA and a concomitant decline in free CoA (CoASH) levels, whereby CoASH becomes limiting for other metabolic reactions. This is referred to as CoASH sequestration. There is, however, limited experimental evidence for this hypothesis. Using a combination of approaches, we test this hypothesis in medium‐chain acyl‐CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD), the most common deficiency of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation (mFAO), under energetic stress. Both in vitro MCAD‐knockout (KO) HepG2 cells and a kinetic model of mFAO showed decreased CoASH, elevated medium‐chain acyl‐CoA, and decreased long‐chain acyl‐CoA levels. MCAD‐KO mice exposed to fasting and cold as energetic stressors had a significantly increased total CoA pool and increased expression of CoA biosynthetic enzymes in the liver, indicative of an upregulated CoA biosynthesis. Expression of carnitine acyltransferases and acyl‐CoA thioesterases, enzymes that liberate CoASH from acyl‐CoAs, was also upregulated, suggesting an adaptive response of CoA metabolism to decreased CoASH. Finally, computational model simulations showed that a combination of elevated total CoA and thioesterase activity led to normalisation of both CoASH and medium‐chain acyl‐CoA levels. Together, the results provide the first evidence for the CoA sequestration hypothesis in MCADD. The observed adaptation of CoA metabolism under energetic stress may act as a compensatory response that counteracts CoASH depletion and accumulation of toxic medium‐chain acyl‐CoAs.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background There is a paucity of data regarding the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib as a second‐line treatment following first‐line combination immunotherapy with durvalumab and tremelimumab (Dur + Tre). Methods This retrospective multicenter study included 14 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma who received lenvatinib after progression on Dur + Tre therapy, conducted at five institutions, including Hiroshima University. In cases where the multidisciplinary team determined that concurrent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) would be beneficial, on‐demand TACE was administered concomitantly with lenvatinib. The therapeutic response and safety profile of lenvatinib were evaluated in all enrolled patients, including those who underwent TACE. Results The objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and median progression‐free survival (PFS) for Dur + Tre and subsequent lenvatinib treatment were 14.3%/30.7%, 57.1%/61.5%, and 2.4/2.3 months, respectively. Five patients (35.7%) received combined lenvatinib and TACE therapy. Among these, one patient each with stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) on Dur + Tre improved to partial response (PR) during lenvatinib therapy. Two patients (14.3%) remained on lenvatinib at the time of analysis. Six patients (42.9%) transitioned to subsequent lines of systemic therapy, all receiving atezolizumab combined with bevacizumab. Overall, five patients (35.7%) had died at the data cutoff, with a median overall survival (OS) of 18.4 months. Grade 3 or higher adverse events (AEs) were observed in 7 patients (50%) across both Dur + Tre and lenvatinib treatment phases. Conclusions Lenvatinib administered after progression on Dur + Tre demonstrates promising efficacy and an acceptable safety profile in patients who tolerate the therapy. The integration of TACE in suitable candidates warrants further exploration, and timely transition to subsequent systemic therapies should be considered when adverse events or intolerance are encountered.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aim Hepatic edema indicates a poor prognosis and impaired quality of life in patients with cirrhosis. Tolvaptan is used in Japan to treat patients who do not respond to conventional diuretics. However, the long‐term prognostic effect of tolvaptan has not yet been fully determined in large‐scale, real‐world cohorts. Methods We conducted a retrospective multicenter study of patients with cirrhosis and hepatic edema who were treated with tolvaptan at 17 centers to identify the clinical predictors of treatment response and long‐term survival. An early response was defined as a ≥ 1.5‐kg weight reduction within 7 days. Results Of 1165 patients, 58.8% showed an early response. In a multivariate analysis, blood urea nitrogen concentrations (BUN; per 1.0‐mg/dL decrease), serum sodium concentrations (per 10‐mEq/L increase), and the absence of hepatocellular carcinoma were independently associated with an early response. Early responders had longer overall survival than non‐responders (median, 15.3 vs. 7.7 months; p = 2.70 × 10 −6 ). An early response remained an independent factor associated with 5‐year survival (hazard ratio: 0.83; p = 2.60 × 10 −2 ) after adjustment for age, hepatic functional reserve, hepatocellular carcinoma, serum sodium concentrations, and BUN concentrations. Subgroup analyses of liver‐related mortality were consistent with the primary survival analysis. Conclusions An early response to tolvaptan, which is more likely to occur in patients without elevated BUN concentrations or hyponatremia, is independently associated with improved long‐term survival in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic edema. Our findings indicate the importance of initiating tolvaptan treatment before renal impairment or hyponatremia develops.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arbovirus belonging to the Flaviviridae family and Orthoflavivirus genus, with a pronounced tropism for the central nervous system (CNS), where it induces neuroinflammation and neuronal death. ZIKV is known to exploit host cellular mechanisms, including the activation of survival pathways such as the PI3K/AKT signalling cascade, to evade apoptosis and enhance its replication. However, the role of the PI3Kγ isoform in ZIKV‐induced neuroinflammation has not been previously explored, and this study aimed to investigate PI3Kγ in ZIKV pathogenesis. Primary neuronal cultures from PI3Kγ‐deficient mice (PI3Kγ kd/kd ) and human neuroblastoma SH‐SY5Y cells treated with the PI3Kγ inhibitor AS605240 were infected with ZIKV to assess the impact of PI3Kγ signalling on viral replication and neuronal survival. Additionally, interferon α/β receptor knockout (A129) mice were treated with AS605240 either before or after ZIKV infection to evaluate the pathway's role in neuroinflammation. In vitro, both genetic ablation and pharmacological inhibition of PI3Kγ suppressed ZIKV replication (~3% and ~17%, respectively) and prevented neuronal death (~16%). In vivo, mice treated with the PI3Kγ inhibitor exhibited enhanced protection against ZIKV infection, characterised by reduced viral load (~12%) and diminished brain and optic nerve damage. This neuroprotective effect correlated with reduced TNF production (about ~67%) by microglia. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3Kγ curtailed the recruitment and activation of CD8+ T cells and decreased the production of pro‐inflammatory mediators, including IFN‐γ and IL‐17, in the brains of ZIKV‐infected mice. These findings suggest that PI3Kγ activation facilitates ZIKV infection and exacerbates neuroinflammation. Pharmacological inhibition of the PI3Kγ pathway may offer therapeutic benefits by limiting viral replication and alleviating neuroinflammatory responses during ZIKV infection.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Crimean‐Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick‐borne orthonairovirus associated with severe hemorrhagic fever and high mortality in humans. The genome is comprised of three segments of single‐stranded, negative‐sense RNA. The nucleocapsid (NP) protein, which is the focus of our study, encoded by the smallest (S) segment, plays a central role in viral RNA encapsidation and is known to be highly immunogenic, eliciting innate, humoral and cellular immune responses. This study aimed to identify the immunodominant regions of the NP that trigger T cell‐mediated immune responses. To this end, three truncated variants of the NP from the CCHFV Kelkit'06 strain [NPdelN(1–135 aa), NPdelM(136–295 aa) and NPdelC(296–482 aa)] as well as the full‐length NP(1–482 aa) were tested. Following mice immunisations, local lymph node cells were used as the source of lymphocytes and these cells were assessed to gauge the T cell responses. Stimulated splenocytes were analysed for lymphoproliferative responses and cytokine mRNA expression to evaluate T cell polarisation. Based on the data obtained, it appears that the amino‐terminal region (1–135 amino acids) of NP is significantly more immunogenic than the other regions. In contrast, the carboxy‐terminal region (296–482 aa) appears to play a suppressive role in cellular immune activation. Additionally, the middle region (136–295 aa) of the NP is identified as being responsible for inducing Th17‐type cellular immune responses. In conclusion, this study points out to the specific regions of the CCHFV NP that are involved in shaping the cellular immune responses, representing a crucial step toward refining the structural elements contributing anti‐viral immunity and providing a sound ground for modulation efforts.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aim To synthesize scientific evidence on the factors influencing the implementation of cultural competence by nurses in the care of migrant populations. Background/Introduction Global migration has intensified cultural diversity in healthcare settings, highlighting the need for nurses to develop cultural competence to deliver safe and equitable care. However, evidence on factors influencing its implementation in nursing practice remains fragmented. Methods An integrative literature review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and PRISMA guidelines. A systematic search of CINAHL, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science using the PICo framework identified peer‐reviewed primary studies published between 2014 and 2024 in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. Fourteen studies met the eligibility criteria, were critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Qualitative Checklist, and classified according to Melnyk and Fineout‐Overholt's levels of evidence. Results All included studies were classified as Level VI evidence, with overall good methodological coherence. Facilitating factors for cultural competence included respect for cultural differences, exposure to multicultural contexts, and continuing education in cultural diversity. Persistent barriers were language difficulties, limited cultural knowledge, and a lack of structured training in cultural competence. Discussion The findings indicate that cultural competence is a dynamic and context‐dependent process shaped by individual experiences, educational opportunities, and organizational support, consistent with established transcultural nursing frameworks. Conclusion Effective implementation of cultural competence in nursing requires sustained education, experiential learning, and institutional commitment to address persistent barriers in migrant care. Implications for Nursing Identifying facilitators and barriers supports the development of strategies to enhance nurses’ cultural competence in diverse care settings. Implications for Nursing Policy These findings inform institutional policies that promote culturally competent nursing care in multicultural health systems.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Aim To examine how green organizational culture and nurses’ climate change skepticism influence hospitals’ eco‐capability, and whether climate skepticism moderates this relationship. Background Hospitals contribute significantly to environmental degradation, highlighting the importance of eco‐capability in achieving sustainable healthcare. Nurses play a central role in implementing environmental practices; however, their engagement may be hindered by skeptical beliefs about climate change. Methods A cross‐sectional survey was conducted among 564 nurses from five hospitals in Egypt. Validated Arabic versions of the Eco‐Capability in Healthcare Scale, the Green Organizational Culture Scale, and the Climate Change Skepticism Questionnaire were used. Multiple regression and moderation analyses were applied to test study hypotheses. Results Green culture was positively associated with eco‐capability, while climate change skepticism had a strong negative effect. Skepticism also moderated the culture–capability link. Eco‐capability was highest among nurses with low skepticism and lowest among those with high skepticism. Participation in climate training and involvement in initiatives independently predicted higher eco‐capability. Discussion The findings show that eco‐capability depends on the alignment between organizational culture and nurses’ beliefs. A supportive green culture encourages sustainable practice, but its influence is reduced when nurses hold skeptical views about climate change. Educational exposure and participation in environmental activities appear to strengthen engagement and help counter belief‐based barriers. Conclusion Eco‐capability can be enhanced when hospitals strengthen green culture and reduce climate skepticism among nurses. Implications for Nursing Integrating sustainability and climate content into nursing education and professional development can reduce skepticism and promote environmentally responsible practice. Implications for Nursing and Health Policy Policymakers should integrate eco‐capability benchmarks into accreditation standards, link sustainability indicators to nurse performance appraisal, and allocate resources for participatory initiatives that actively engage nurses.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Far‐right politics has re‐emerged as a significant force in mainstream Western liberal democracies, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, where it has been linked to rising levels of racial discrimination and violence that threaten to erode the fragile ideals of democratic peace within these contexts. In a 'post‐truth' era, digital aesthetics that blur the line between extremist propaganda and innocuous entertainment are being used to mainstream far‐right ideologies, including Whiteness and White racial supremacy, through sites of public pedagogy, particularly social media platforms, where they are normalised as ‘commonsense’. In response, progressive scholars have called for the mainstreaming of peaceful civic dissent in Western liberal democracies to counter the far‐right. Yet this call unfolds in a context in which democratic governments frame peaceful civic dissent—such as protests against racialised inequalities—as threats to democratic peace, rather than acts that defend democracy. As physical dissent faces heightened surveillance, digital platforms offer alternative, albeit contested, spaces for political action. However, there is a dearth of research on how digital platforms are being used to mobilise dissent against pernicious racial ideologies of Whiteness that have become normalised as ‘commonsense’ in Western liberal democracies, including those that operate through far‐right digital aesthetics. This paper addresses this gap by analysing how innovative contemporary art practices employ digitally mediated forms of aesthetic dissensus to stage and mobilise dissent against such ‘commonsense’ racial ideologies of Whiteness within and through mainstream social media platforms. I argue that such dissent does not threaten democratic ideals, such as peace, but instead sustains them through emancipatory public pedagogies that challenge racially inequitable norms and progressively reconfigure what counts as ‘commonsense’ within democratic life.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Ethnic differences in type 2 diabetes risk highlight the need for accurate detection of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) across all ethnic groups. This study assessed the sensitivity and specificity of HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 1‐h plasma glucose for identifying IGT in 66 Black African (BA) and 77 White European (WE) men. Participants underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, and diagnostic performance was evaluated using ROC analyses. One‐hour glucose showed the highest sensitivity (BA 77.8%, WE 94.1%) and AUC (0.78), whereas FPG 6.1–6.9 mmol/L had the poorest sensitivity (≤7.4%) and lowest AUC (0.49). HbA1c demonstrated ethnic variation: WHO criteria (6.0–6.4%) were more sensitive but less specific in BA than WE men; ADA criteria (5.7–6.4%) showed reduced specificity in BA men. Optimal cut‐points differed by ethnicity for all markers. Findings suggest HbA1c and FPG may inadequately detect IGT, while 1‐h glucose offers superior diagnostic performance.",

    "Abstract": "Infectious salmon anaemia virus (ISAV) can cause disease and mortality in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). The virus is endemic in several regions including the Atlantic coast of Canada. Lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) are increasingly utilised as cleaner fish to control sea lice levels in Atlantic salmon farms. With welfare concerns for both species, and the possibility of escaped fish, the objective of this study was to determine the susceptibility of lumpfish to ISAV. Lumpfish were exposed to two ISAV isolates (high and low virulence) through a cohabitation challenge (i.e., exposure to infected salmon) and through an intra-peritoneal challenge. Naïve salmon were exposed simultaneously to the same isolates tested to verify their virulence. In the cohabitation challenge, ISAV infection progressed as expected in the naïve salmon. ISAV was detected in a small number of lumpfish gill samples, but the lack of detection in other organs, e.g., heart, kidney, spleen, liver, and blood, suggests environmental contamination. Although two lumpfish blood samples tested positive in the later stages of the challenge, all other disease indicators, including a lack of anaemia, did not support potential for virus replication in lumpfish. Based on both exposure experiments, lumpfish do not appear to be susceptible to ISAV.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background Congenital upper airway malformations and malacia are important causes of respiratory morbidity in early infancy, yet population‐based epidemiological data remain scarce, particularly in Latin America. Most available estimates derive from single‐centre cohorts, limiting generalizability and health system planning. Methods We conducted a nationwide, retrospective, population‐based study using Colombia's administrative healthcare database (RIPS). We identified healthcare encounters coded with ICD‐10 diagnoses corresponding to congenital upper airway malformations and malacia among children younger than 1 year between 2016 and 2024. Crude and sex‐specific prevalence rates were calculated per 100 000 children. Age‐standardised prevalence rates were estimated using the WHO world standard population. Temporal trends were assessed using Poisson regression models with population offsets and visualised using LOESS smoothing. Results A total of 29 450 cases were identified, corresponding to a national crude prevalence of 263.0 per 100 000 children and an age‐standardised prevalence of 23.1 per 100 000. The most frequent diagnoses were congenital nasal septum perforation, laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, and unspecified congenital nasal malformations. Overall prevalence was higher among females than males, although marked heterogeneity was observed across specific diagnoses. Temporal trend analysis demonstrated a significant annual increase of approximately 3% in upper airway malformations, with diagnosis‐specific patterns showing increasing, stable, or decreasing trends over time. Conclusions Congenital upper airway malformations and malacia represent a substantial and evolving burden in Colombian infants. Population‐based administrative data provide valuable insights into disease frequency, sex differences and temporal trends, supporting their use for health system planning and epidemiological surveillance.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective This study evaluated the association between intestinal anatomical characteristics—including the resected bowel segment, residual small bowel length (RSBL), and preservation of the ileocecal valve (ICV)—and treatment outcomes in children with short bowel syndrome (SBS). Methods A retrospective study was conducted of 35 paediatric SBS patients who underwent small bowel resection at the study site from July 2021 to July 2024. SBS was defined by an RSBL ≤ 25% of the expected length for age or dependence on parenteral nutrition ≥ 60 days. Treatment outcomes were categorised as successful (clinical stabilisation and discharge) or unsuccessful (death or lack of improvement). Results Most patients underwent surgery during the neonatal period (91.4%). A majority had RSBL &gt; 38 cm (88.6%), preserved ICV (74.2%), and intact colon (67.7%). The overall treatment success rate was 60% ( n = 21), while mortality or failure occurred in 40% ( n = 14). The mean RSBL in the success group (86.1 ± 28.1 cm) was significantly longer than in the failure group (52.7 ± 24.9 cm; p &lt; 0.001). All patients with very short (15–38 cm) or ultra‐short (&lt; 15 cm) RSBL experienced treatment failure or death ( p &lt; 0.05). Preservation of both the colon and ICV was significantly associated with treatment success ( p &lt; 0.05). Patients without ICV preservation had longer median hospital stays than those with ICV preservation (126 days vs. 100.5 days; p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion Colon and ileocecal valve preservation are key prognostic factors improving outcomes and reducing hospitalisation in paediatric short bowel syndrome.",

    "Abstract": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of betamethasone following intra-articular administration to horses have been described; however, studies characterizing intramuscular administration are lacking. Twenty-four horses received an intramuscular dose of 12 mg betamethasone sodium phosphate/betamethasone acetate. Blood and urine were collected at post administration for up to 408 h. Concentrations of betamethasone were determined using LC-MS/MS and pharmacokinetic parameters determined using a Population PK three-compartment model. The duration of pharmacodynamic effects was assessed by measuring changes in cortisol and inflammatory biomarkers utilizing an ex vivo model. The C<sub>max</sub>, T<sub>max</sub>, and terminal half-life of betamethasone were 6.43 ± 1.70 ng/mL, 0.75 (0.5-2.0 h; median and range), and 30.5 ± 20.4 h, respectively. Covariates were not found to have significant effects on the variability of pharmacokinetic parameters. Based on Monte Carlo simulations, for 1000 horses, a detection time of 23 days is recommended for concentrations to fall below the screening limit of 10 pg/mL in 99% of the population. Urine concentrations were above the limit of quantitation in 2/24 horses at 408 h. Suppression of cortisol lasted for 360 h. Effects on inflammatory biomarker production lasted for a prolonged period. An extended withdrawal time for intramuscular administration prior to competition is warranted.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This study examines the intricate relationships between external debt and the depletion of economic resources across 54 African economies between 1990 and 2023, by running dynamic panel methods such as System GMM and panel cointegration to analyze endogeneity. The assessment points out a nonlinear debt limit at 55% of GDP and shows that Chinese secured loans have a greater negative impact on the environment than loans from other creditors. Our findings show that a 10% increase in the debt‐to‐GDP ratio leads to a 1.7% increase in deforestation and a 2.3% increase in mineral extraction, with these effects being more acute in resource‐dependent economies. The analysis further uncovered that the climate‐debt spiral, in which debt distress impels short‐term resource harvesting, therefore perturbing long‐term sustainability. The analysis gets a nonlinear threshold of debt at 55%, which elucidates the pronounced environmental impact of Chinese secured loans relative to other financing sources. We propose policies that can harmonize debt sustainability with ecological protection by means of conditional debt relief, governance reforms, and technology‐driven monitoring. The study adds to the flow of works on debt overhang, environmental economics, and sustainable development in resource‐abundant, capital‐scarce environments.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Objectives The main goal of this article is to investigate individual‐level standards of evidence in the political realm. Our specific objective is to understand what evidentiary standards voters rely on when they evaluate the effectiveness of legislation passed by their in‐party versus an out‐party. Methods Our empirical investigation is based on original survey data collected in August 2023 in the United States. We presented people with a hypothetical economic policy, and we randomized policy authorship (Democrat / Republican / Bipartisan). Respondents were then asked to state what outcomes they would need to observe to evaluate whether the presented policy was effective. Results Our analysis provides two main findings. First, both Democrats and Republicans apply looser evidentiary standards for policies passed by their own party. Second, we find that policy authorship also influences the type of evidence that people rely on when they evaluate policy. Our models suggest that individuals are (1) less likely to consider long time horizons and (2) less likely to reflect on alternative causes when they evaluate the efficacy of a bipartisan economic policy compared to one authored by only one major party. Conclusion Our findings suggest that Democrats and Republicans consider their own policies as more efficacious at least in part because they have adopted less stringent standards for perceived policy success. Thus, our work highlights a novel cognitive process that contributes to partisan bias in policy evaluation.",

To acquire events occurring in the sensitive volume with a high granularity, the Cygno collaboration is developing a solution where the light generated during the avalanche processes occurring in a multiplication stage based on Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) is read out by optical sensors with very high sensitivity and spatial resolution.

This paper presents data collected with a prototype featuring a sensitive volume of about two liters, together with a model developed by the collaboration to describe and predict the gain dependence on charge density. A comparison with experimental data shows that the model reproduces, with a percent-level precision, the gain behaviour over nearly one order of magnitude.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Exploring the limits of color interactions in multiquark states is an important topic. Within the bag confinement picture of hadrons, we find that for singly heavy pentaquark systems, the bag confinement radius falls precisely within the range of color interaction limits provided by lattice QCD (approximately 1.17–1.29 fm). This leads us to suggest that these singly heavy pentaquark states may lie close to the compact limit, yet retain the potential to form prominent resonant states. Inspired by singly heavy baryons, we consider their mirror pentaquark counterparts. By incorporating both chromomagnetic and color-electric interactions between heavy and strange quarks, we calculate the mass spectrum of singly heavy pentaquarks in the $$qqqQ\\bar{q}$$ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>q</mml:mi> <mml:mi>q</mml:mi> <mml:mi>q</mml:mi> <mml:mi>Q</mml:mi> <mml:mover> <mml:mrow> <mml:mi>q</mml:mi> </mml:mrow> <mml:mrow> <mml:mo>¯</mml:mo> </mml:mrow> </mml:mover> </mml:mrow> </mml:math> configuration and analyze the stability of their S-wave two-body strong decays. Our computations show that the masses of the singly heavy pentaquark system are generally about 500 MeV higher than those of the corresponding mirror baryon ground states, a result consistent with findings from chiral methods. Based on light-quark flavor symmetry, we establish a mass mapping relation between singly heavy pentaquarks and singly heavy baryons. The analysis of strong decays indicates that these singly heavy pentaquarks are unstable against strong decays, which aligns with our initial hypothesis.",

    "Abstract": "Online Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms have become indispensable tools for users seeking expert solutions to their technical queries. The effectiveness of these platforms relies on their ability to identify and direct questions to the most knowledgeable users within the community, a process known as Expert Finding (EF). EF accuracy is crucial for increasing user engagement and the reliability of provided answers. We present TUEF, a Topic-oriented User-Interaction model for EF , which aims to fully and transparently leverage the heterogeneous information available within online CQA platforms. TUEF integrates content and social data by constructing a multi-layer graph that maps user relationships based on their answering patterns on specific topics. By combining these sources of information, TUEF identifies the most relevant users for any given question and ranks them using learning-to-rank techniques. Our findings indicate that TUEF's topic-oriented model significantly enhances performance, particularly in large communities discussing well-defined topics. Additionally, we show that the interpretable learning-to-rank algorithm integrated into TUEF offers transparency and explainability with minimal performance trade-offs. The exhaustive experiments conducted across six CQA communities show that TUEF outperforms all competitors, achieving a minimum performance boost of 42.42% in P@1, 32.73% in NDCG@3, 21.76% in R@5, and 29.81% in MRR.",

    "Abstract": "Query performance prediction (QPP) is a technique for evaluating the retrieval quality of a search system for a given query without relying on human relevance judgment. Recently, large language models (LLMs) presented a promising avenue for this task. However, while existing pointwise methods have proven effective, they do not fully exploit the potential advantages offered by comparative analyses, such as pairwise comparisons between retrieved elements. Our study evaluates the suitability of these approaches for post-retrieval, LLM-based QPP. We conducted a comprehensive analysis comparing LLMs’ (Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-8B) outputs with human-judged performance using correlations of metrics such as NDCG@10 and RR@10 and assessed computational efficiency regarding the number of LLM inferences. When evaluated on the correlation between actual retrieval performance and performance predicted by LLM methods, nearly all pairwise approaches outperform the pointwise baseline in the setting without fine-tuning, and in selected fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, pairwise approaches show substantially higher correlation with the ANCE retriever, while their correlation with BM25 varies across methods, with some exhibiting stronger alignment and others performing similarly or worse than the pointwise method. Our approach reduces computational complexity by introducing comparisons only against a selected subset of reference items.",

    "Abstract": "Source-free domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims at adapting a model trained on the source domain to the target domain without requiring access to the source data. Self-training has emerged as a leading approach to address this challenging problem. However, without robust denoising mechanisms to reduce the noise in pseudo labels, it still easily fall into biased estimates. Most existing methods address this issue by introducing novel architectures, but often at the cost of increased model complexity or reliance on additional input modalities. Different from previous studies, this paper introduces UniSFDA , a unified multi-stage self-training framework that integrates cross-model transfer learning, uncertainty-aware pseudo label fusion, and intra-domain style augmentation, thereby enhancing both segmentation accuracy and test-time efficiency. Our proposed framework offers exceptional flexibility, with each component being independent and ready to be integrated into any existing self-training framework. Additionally, we investigate the performance of various representative segmentation models, including DeepLabv2, SegFormer, DFormer, and ViT-Adapter, within our framework. It is worth noting that UniSFDA is model-agnostic, allowing both source and target networks to be instantiated with arbitrary segmentation architectures, and thus readily benefiting from future advances in segmentation models. Experiments on the GTA5 \\(\\rightarrow\\) Cityscapes and SYNTHIA \\(\\rightarrow\\) Cityscapes benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. With DeepLabv2 (SegFormer) as the source model, UniSFDA establishes new state-of-the-art performance, achieving mIoU scores of 61.8% (65.4%) and 57.9% (59.6%) on the two benchmarks, respectively.",

    "Abstract": "Metamorphic testing (MT) is a black-box testing technique to alleviate the oracle problem via leveraging Metamorphic Relations (MRs) based on the domain knowledge of the software under test. In recent years, software testing researchers have made significant research advancements on MT in fundamental theories (e.g., MR identification and composition), methodologies (e.g., test input generation), and fault detection effectiveness in various application domains. However, there still exist some major challenges of MT yet to be addressed, such as the needs for a general MR description language, and an automated system that supports all major steps of MT and integrates the various MT tasks. To address these challenges, we have developed a general MR description language (called the Category-Choice Metamorphic specification Language; abbreviated as CCML), through which an automated supporting tool (called the Category-Choice Metamorphic testing Tool; abbreviated as CCMT) integrating the various MT tasks has been built. CCMT supports the automatic generation of test inputs and composite MRs and integrates various run-time optimization strategies. We have also conducted empirical studies to evaluate the expressiveness of CCML and the performance of CCMT in various testing aspects. Overall, our empirical findings are encouraging, and have demonstrated the merits of CCML and CCMT. In this regard, our work contributes to improving the fault detection effectiveness, efficiency, and practicality of MT and, hence, brings the use of MT to a new height.",

    "Abstract": "Eye-tracking-driven controls for assistive robotic arms provide people with severe physical disabilities with intuitive interaction opportunities.In this context, shared control can improve acceptance of the robot by partially automating task execution. Based on recent literature, we present a Wizard of Oz design for shared control driven by eye-tracking. This approach allows for the rapid exploration of user expectations to inform future design iterations. Two studies were conducted to assess user experience, identify design challenges, and determine ways to improve usability and accessibility. The first study involved people with severe motor disabilities (PSMD) and consisted of an online survey. The second study aimed to gain technical insights through direct robot interaction to provide a comprehensive overview of the findings.",

    "Abstract": "The cellular biology of macrophages underpins the multitude of roles that these cells undertake under homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. Macrophages populate all tissues where they contribute to organ physiology while acting as sensors of health and triggering inflammation in response to organ dysfunction, trauma and infection. Sharing key characteristics such as a highly developed endocytic compartment, secretion of growth factors and cytokines, motility and antigen presentation, macrophages undergo specific adaptations in each niche guided by environmental clues that result in diverse phenotypes that support tissue-specific roles such as iron recycling, synaptic pruning, bone reabsorption and processing of lung surfactant. This review will provide an overview of macrophage biology and heterogeneity that underpin their contribution to homeostasis and inflammation to illustrate their importance as therapeutic targets in a wide range of inflammatory diseases.",

    "Abstract": "Background Hypoalbuminemia is associated with worse postoperative outcomes, but data is limited in the bariatric population. Patients with BMI ≥50 may represent a higher-risk group for malnutrition. Methods We analyzed MBSAQIP data (2015-2022) for patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Propensity score matching was used to control for 22 preoperative variables. We compared 30-day outcomes and bariatric-specific complications in patients with albumin &lt;3.5 g/dL vs ≥3.5 g/dL across four groups: SG with BMI ≥50 (analysis 1), RYGB with BMI ≥50 (analysis 2), SG with BMI &lt;50 (analysis 3), and RYGB with BMI &lt;50 (analysis 4). Results Among 728,915 patients, matched cohorts in analyses 1 (n = 17,548), 2 (n = 9459), 3 (n = 16,025), and 4 (n = 6787) had similar preoperative characteristics. Hypoalbuminemia was associated with increased complications across all groups. In patients with BMI ≥50, hypoalbuminemia was significantly associated with increased mortality (SG 0.2% vs 0.1%, P = 0.011; RYGB 0.3% vs 0.1%, P &lt; 0.001), unplanned ICU admission (SG 1.0% vs 0.7%, P = 0.020; RYGB 1.6% vs 1.2%, P = 0.034), and non-home discharge (SG 0.8% vs 0.5%, P &lt; 0.001; RYGB 0.9% vs 0.6%, P = 0.009). These mortality differences were not observed in patients with BMI &lt;50. Conclusion Hypoalbuminemia is associated with higher complications rates after bariatric surgery and increased mortality in patients with BMI ≥50. Preoperative nutritional optimization is strongly recommended in this high-risk group.",

    "Abstract": "The discussion of labor return migration has often framed workers’ reintegration and settlement within the migration-development debate, with a particular interest in promoting migrant entrepreneurship. This article extends such discussion beyond the confines of the development frame by providing a dynamic and diverse understanding of return using a bottom-up perspective. Building on the critical scholarship on labor return migration, it stresses that through the process of their migratory life, workers undergo shifts in, and reflections of, their value system and life goals. Our findings, drawn from interviews with migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong, and return workers in Indonesia and the Philippines, show that while some workers might continue to conduct circular returns for economic and other purposes, others embarked on home-return for settlement, also for different purposes. The fact that both their home-bound and destination-bound returns entail motivations beyond economic narratives, leads us to propose a broad conceptual frame, the ‘returnscape’. This concept allows the capturing of the different temporalities, spatialities, motivations and outcomes of labor return migration derived from the emic perspectives of return. This article thus helps stretch the scholarship of labor return migration beyond the migration-development nexus, and provides a proactive and more nuanced approach to the complex nature of ‘returning’.",

    "Abstract": "ObjectiveThis study investigated the effect of sharing vehicle situation awareness (VSA) on driver takeover behavior in complex urban environments.BackgroundAs automated vehicles (AV) expand their operational design domain, little is known about driver interactions with driving automation in complex urban settings. Drivers often become either overly reliant on automation or fail to rely on it even when capable, leading to misuse or disuse. Sharing VSA information could enhance drivers' awareness of the AV system and response when AVs request manual control in complex situations.MethodsA driving simulator tested sharing VSA information via augmented reality head-up displays (AR HUDs) during takeover scenarios. Participants were assigned to control or experimental groups that received different combinations of VSA elements: perception (object highlighting), comprehension (confidence assessment), and projection (trajectory information). Two urban driving scenarios (parking lane and intersection) were tested.ResultsSharing VSA information reduced driver-initiated automation disengagement before takeover requests without delaying response times. Perception information alone showed no significant difference from baseline, but adding egocentric projection information significantly reduced driver-initiated overrides, while allocentric projection did not. Adding confidence assessment further enhanced effectiveness. The parking lane scenario was associated with quicker responses, fewer full takeovers, and softer braking.ConclusionSpecific combinations of VSA information reduced driver-initiated disengagement from automation without compromising response times. The type and presentation of shared information significantly affect human-automation interaction.ApplicationThese findings can guide the design of AV systems that better support driver-vehicle interaction in complex urban environments.",

    "Abstract": "People experiencing homelessness (PEH) face more mental health-related problems and a worse quality of life (QoL) than the general population. This research aimed to know the repercussion of a psychosocial healthcare program with PEH using mobile phones. This quasi-experimental study previously and subsequently evaluated interventions with 30 users (Complete Intervention = 23; Partial Intervention = 7) at 3 and 6 months. They periodically attended two municipal shelters for PEH.. At 3 months, those who did the complete intervention presented significant improvements in self-perceived QoL, with this significance moving toward anxiety/depression and responsible alcohol consumption. Those who completed the study indicated a high degree of satisfaction with it and adhered to scheduled appointments. The PEH who adhered to the study obtained a better initial psychosocial evaluation than those who dropped out. Thus, future studies with more participants would clear up doubts about the tendency of the variables that improved in this study. We recommend healthcare professionals to go directly to where PEH are and to set up mobile phone follow-up because PEH's personal conditions do not allow them to go to mental health appointments.",

    "Abstract": "Amputation may disrupt body schema through impairments in attentional mechanisms within the central nervous system. This study examined behavioral performance and low-frequency oscillatory (LFO) activity in individuals with upper-limb amputations (ULA), lower-limb amputations (LLA), and healthy controls (HC). Participants included six ULA (5 Male, 1 Female), nine LLA (7 Male, 2 Female), and eleven HC (8 Male, 3 Female). During electroencephalography (EEG) recording, participants performed a hand laterality task with stimuli varying in laterality (right vs. left) and angular orientation (0° vs. 180°). EEG was recorded before and after lateralization training. Accuracy was higher for stimuli presented at 0° than at 180° (<i>p</i> < .05), and overall accuracy significantly improved following training (<i>p</i> < .001). ULA exhibited slower reaction times than LLA (<i>p</i> < .05). EEG results showed a greater increase in delta (1.5-3 Hz) power in ULA compared with HC (<i>p</i> < .05). Right-hand stimuli and those presented at 0° modulated delta phase responses (<i>p</i> < .05). Increased theta (4-7 Hz) power and phase responses after training suggest enhanced oscillatory entrainment through attentional engagement (<i>p</i> < .05). Overall, behavioral and electrophysiological findings provide insight into bodily attention mechanisms in amputees and have implications for neurorehabilitation. Future studies with larger and more homogeneous samples are needed to improve generalizability and clarify underlying mechanisms.",

Ten males who completed the ESS intervention were recruited through purposive sampling and participated in semi-structured interviews exploring helpful aspects, barriers to access, relationships with staff, the intervention environment, and experiences of personal change. Thematic analysis generated three superordinate themes: “Positive change is experienced through ESS,” “Making a change is not straightforward,” and “The environment needs to be considered.” ESS was experienced as transformative, with trusting relationships with staff central to change. However, participants highlighted the difficulties of making and sustaining changes within custody. The findings emphasize the challenges of delivering a psychologically informed service in prison and the importance of service user choice and relational practice in meeting the aims of ESS and the wider OPD pathway.",

    "Abstract": "Based on three case studies of living forms coexisting in the Atacama Desert, we use a perspective of feminist care to analyze how humans and non-humans (cells) live, adapt or transform in the face of the effects of extractivism in northern Chile. Firstly, we analyze gender roles within the context of extractive mining in the Antofagasta region, including the role of madresposas (mother-wives) in the state mineral deposits of Chuquicamata and the role of sex workers in the nitrate ruins of Pampa Unión. Secondly, we examine forms of care provided by women in the Indigenous pastoral space of the Puna de Atacama. Finally, we analyze how female aquatic invertebrates (rotifers) from the Inka-Coya Lake react to threats on desert ecosystems by developing different forms of resistance to extractivism. These three cases each paradoxically show care practices associated with repair and adaptation aimed at sustaining life in highly intervened environments. As an alternative to the “technical masculine” approach typically used to analyze the exploitation of nitrate, copper, and lithium in northern Chile, this work helps us understand relationships of human and non-human communities with their environment. Basándonos en tres estudios de caso sobre formas de vida que coexisten en el desierto de Atacama, adoptamos una perspectiva de cuidados feministas para analizar cómo humanos y no humanos (células) viven, se adaptan o se transforman frente a los efectos del extractivismo en el norte de Chile. En primer lugar, analizamos los roles de género en el contexto de la minería extractiva en la región de Antofagasta, incluyendo el papel de las madresposas en los yacimientos minerales estatales de Chuquicamata y el rol de las trabajadoras sexuales en las ruinas salitreras de Pampa Unión. En segundo lugar, examinamos las formas de cuidado brindadas por mujeres en el espacio pastoril indígena de la Puna de Atacama. Finalmente, analizamos cómo invertebrados acuáticos hembra (rotíferos) del lago Inka-Coya reaccionan ante las amenazas a los ecosistemas desérticos desarrollando distintas formas de resistencia al extractivismo. Estos tres casos muestran, de manera paradójica, prácticas de cuidado asociadas a la reparación y la adaptación orientadas a sostener la vida en entornos altamente intervenidos. Como alternativa al enfoque “técnico masculino” que suele emplearse para analizar la explotación del salitre, el cobre y el litio en el norte de Chile, este trabajo contribuye a comprender las relaciones de comunidades humanas y no humanas con su entorno.",

Findings revealed that private sector mothers experienced higher guilt than those in the public sector. Mothers working fewer than 6 hours daily reported lower guilt and higher job satisfaction compared to those working 9 hours or more. Although no significant relationship was found between perceived social support and employment guilt, results indicated that job satisfaction decreased as guilt increased. The study highlights challenges in balancing work and family roles and underscores the need for family-friendly workplace policies. These policies could reduce maternal guilt and improve job satisfaction, offering practical insights for organizations to better support working mothers.",

Through the utilization of semi-structured interviews conducted with five mothers and fifteen teachers, the research applied thematic analysis to elucidate patterns regarding the recognition and nurturing of talents such as artistic expression, mechanical proficiency, and academic capabilities—within both domestic and educational contexts. The results indicate that although both stakeholder groups recognize the varied competencies of deaf students, their endeavors are frequently hindered by systemic obstacles, including insufficient teacher training, absence of specialized resources, communication barriers, and socioeconomic challenges. Mothers assume a pivotal role in providing emotional and material support; however, numerous individuals encounter impediments such as illiteracy and financial constraints. Teachers, while perceptive of students’ strengths, often lack the necessary resources and institutional backing to effectively cultivate talent.",

    "Abstract": "This article analyses the imaginaries and identities that comprised the idea of Global Britain in the post-Brexit period. Global Britain emerged as a re-articulation of the United Kingdom’s place in the world following the vote to leave the European Union in 2016. Drawing on six discrete but related articles, this Special Issue on Global Britain shows what drove this idea and how audiences, domestic and international, responded to its narrative with a mixture of enthusiasm, mockery, disdain, and even anger for this renewed vision of Britain and its place in the world. From internal disputes within the Conservative Party to attitudes towards the Monarchy, via foreign policy formation, technological innovation, and message reception among foreign media, Global Britain was articulated in order to mitigate the sense of ontological insecurity generated by the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union and the new geopolitical environment of the 2020s. Part foreign policy, part national narrative, it was not the first such re-articulation of England, Britain, and the United Kingdom, nor will it be the last. This is because such narratives are not only broad foreign policy frameworks but are national narratives that seek to provide a sense of ontological security at a moment of geopolitical change.",

    "Abstract": "Background Despite anticoagulation, 50% of proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) cases progress to post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). While percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) reduces thrombotic burden, optimal venous access selection (popliteal vs infrapopliteal) remains unestablished. This study compares long-term outcomes between these approaches. Methods A retrospective cohort of 56 acute DVT patients (28 per group) underwent propensity score matching for age, sex, symptom duration, and thrombus extent. All received PMT via either infrapopliteal access or popliteal access at a tertiary center (2021-2024). Primary outcomes included PTS incidence and access site complications. Results Popliteal access demonstrated shorter establishment time (15 vs 22.5 min, p &lt; .01), while infrapopliteal access preferentially utilized the peroneal vein (69.2%). No intraoperative complications; minor postoperative events occurred in 5.4% (3/56) without intergroup difference. 48 patients (85.7%) completed ultrasound surveillance (mean follow-up: 21.4 ± 12.4 months). PTS rates were significantly lower with infrapopliteal access (12.5% vs 41.7%, p = .023), with a markedly lower incidence of moderate-to-severe PTS (Villalta ≥10) in the infrapopliteal group (4.2% vs 25.0%, p = .097). These benefits were observed despite comparable residual thrombosis (70.8% overall) and DVT recurrence (12.5%). Conclusion Infrapopliteal PMT, with selective adjunct CDT, is associated with a lower risk of PTS compared to popliteal access, likely due to more complete distal thrombus clearance. Despite longer access times, this approach demonstrates favorable long-term outcomes and represents a viable alternative for DVT management.",

    "Abstract": "Interest in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) physiology and its relevance to neurological disease has increased markedly in recent years. Classical descriptions portray CSF as a unidirectional flow from the choroid plexus to the dural venous sinuses and rarely distinguish between its solutes and the solvent (water) component, which constitutes ~99% of CSF. We conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate current evidence for water exchange between CSF and blood across the blood–CSF barriers (BCSFB). Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria: 15 in experimental animals and six with humans, spanning more than 70 years and employing diverse methodologies. This literature review shows that CSF water moves freely and bidirectionally between CSF and blood across multiple BCSFB sites along the craniospinal axis, including the choroid plexus, ependymal surfaces, pial vessels, and perivascular spaces. The net direction of movement varies locally with hydrostatic, osmotic, and molecular gradients that transiently favor either inflow or outflow. Blood–CSF water exchange occurs predominantly by diffusion and is modulated by aquaporins and local vascular forces. These findings challenge the classical concept of unidirectional CSF production and absorption, supporting instead a dynamic equilibrium where distributed, gradient-driven water flux maintains brain water homeostasis.",

    "Abstract": "Small-scale H-Darrieus turbine ( HDT ) often struggles to reach self-sustained power producing speed due to low start-up torque. Low torque is sometimes manifested in the form of torque plateau or ‘ dead band ’. To improve torque development, turbine design variables such as blade chord-to-radius ratio ( c/r ) and solidity ( σ ) play critical role. To understand the effect of c/r only, this study analyses turbines with identical σ but different c/r using unsteady computational fluid dynamics ( CFD) . Results show that larger c/r enhances torque by influencing the leading-edge flow and vortex formation and convection. Two mechanisms are identified: (i) amplification of the variation of incidence angle along blade chord, effectively acting as aerofoil-camber morphing, and (ii) high blade pitch rate effect, especially at low λ (&lt;1) where intra-cycle pitching is significant. These findings highlight the sensitivity of torque generation to c/r , offering design guidance for improving HDT start-up performance.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Bilateral hip arthroscopy (HA) for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) has demonstrated favorable short-term outcomes. However, the long-term results remain unclear and warrant further investigation. Hypothesis/Purpose: To compare 10-year patient-reported outcomes (PROs), clinically significant outcomes (CSOs), and reoperation-free survivorship between bilateral and unilateral HA. It was hypothesized that both groups would demonstrate comparable PROs, CSO achievement, and survivorship. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A prospective repository was retrospectively reviewed to identify patients undergoing bilateral HA for FAIS between January 2012 and January 2015 with 10-year follow-up. Patients were propensity-matched 1:1 to unilateral HA patients controlling for age, sex, body mass index, and Tönnis grade. Exclusions included revision HA, concomitant procedures, congenital hip disorders, non-FAIS pathologies, staged periacetabular osteotomy, Tönnis grade &gt;1, and missing 10-year follow-up. Hip Outcome Score (HOS) subscale for Activities of Daily Living and the HOS Sports Subscale (HOS-SS), International Hip Outcome Tool, modified Harris Hip Score, and visual analog scale (VAS) for pain/satisfaction were collected. Minimal clinically important difference (MCID), Patient Acceptable Symptom State (PASS), and reoperation-free survivorship were compared. Improvements from baseline to 10 years were correlated between hips. Analysis of variance evaluated differences based on bilateral HA timing. Results: A total of 80 hips in 40 patients with bilateral HA were matched to 80 hips in 80 patients with unilateral HA. Mean follow-up was 10.4 ± 0.6 years. PROs at all time points were comparable. MCID and PASS achievement rates were similar between groups. Reoperation-free survivorship was comparable ( P = .70). Change in index hip scores positively correlated with contralateral hip changes. A 0- to 3-month interval demonstrated superior preoperative HOS-SS compared with 6 to 12 months, whereas a 3- to 6-month interval demonstrated superior 10-year VAS-Pain score compared with 0 to 3 months. Conclusions: Bilateral HA achieved long-term outcomes and reoperation-free survivorship comparable to those of unilateral HA. Index and contralateral hip outcomes were positively correlated. Shorter intervals between procedures were associated with better preoperative function, whereas intermediate intervals were associated with lower long-term pain, but finding this requires further investigation with larger sample sizes.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Cognitive load is an important factor influencing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries. However, few studies have systematically manipulated and quantified cognitive load to examine its biomechanical and neurophysiological consequences. Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the impact of varying cognitive load levels on biomechanical variables associated with ACL injury risk. The study further explored whether individual cognitive performance was related to alterations in ACL injury risk indicators and examined prefrontal cortical activity as an objective marker of mental workload. Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: A total of 30 athletes engaged in team sports performed a single-leg drop vertical jump (SL-DVJ) under 5 cognitive conditions of varying complexity using a modified Go/No-Go task. Biomechanics, behavioral, and prefrontal hemodynamic data variables were recorded. Cognitive performance was assessed through a computerized Go/No-Go task. Results: Higher cognitive load significantly increased peak ground-reaction forces and altered joint kinematics, specifically reducing knee flexion and increasing knee abduction during landing, especially in conditions that required high cognitive demand ( P &lt; .001). These changes were accompanied by increased prefrontal hemoglobin (OxyHb) concentrations, suggesting elevated cortical activation. Furthermore, lower cognitive performance, notably lower accuracy and higher precision-adjusted response time, was associated with more pronounced biomechanical patterns (such as greater ground-reaction forces) and an increase in the risk of ACL injury ( r = −0.471, P &lt; .01; r = 0.650, P &lt; .001, respectively). Conclusion: An increased cognitive load altered the biomechanics of movement during an SL-DVJ, leading to a potential for increased risk of ACL injury. Moreover, athletes with poorer cognitive control may have been more susceptible to these effects. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity increased under conditions of higher cognitive demand. The pattern of regional activation varied according to the type of stimulus (eg, higher OxyHb concentrations for the ventrolateral PFC were observed during the change goal-stimulus condition), suggesting a specific functional organization of the PFC according to the particular demands of executive control. Clinical Relevance: These findings highlight the importance of integrating cognitive challenges into injury prevention and rehabilitation strategies. The findings emphasize the need to consider cognitive load as a central variable in injury risk mitigation and to evaluate cognitive performance as a potential prognostic indicator.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Meniscal tears occur at the time of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in 55% to 65% of patients. These tears exhibit different healing patterns and behavior compared with meniscal tears in a stable knee. The optimal management of different medial, lateral and bicompartmental tears during primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR) has yet to be defined. Purpose: To evaluate the reoperation rates associated with different meniscal treatment strategies and analyze the effect of medial, lateral, and bicompartmental meniscal tears on ACLR outcomes. Study Design: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. Methods: This investigation included 1137 patients undergoing primary ACLR with a concomitant meniscal injury. Patients with chondral defects and multiligament knee injuries were excluded. Meniscal treatments were divided into 3 categories: left in situ (LIS), partial meniscectomy (PM), and repair. Reoperation was defined as the primary endpoint, and multivariable analysis was conducted to identify patient and tear characteristics associated with reoperation. The influence of different treatment strategies on return to play (RTP), ACL reinjury rate, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) was reported at 2 years. The PROMs recorded were the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, the Marx Activity Rating Scale, and the Anterior Cruciate Ligament–Return to Sport after Injury score. Results: The mean age was 24.0 ± 6.9 years, and 76% of patients were male. Most injuries were noncontact (64.9%), commonly resulting from pivoting/sidestepping (50.1%). No significant differences in injury mechanism, playing surface, or footwear type were found between medial, lateral, or bicompartmental tears. Reoperation rates for patients were low for lateral (1.3%), medial (2.6%), and bicompartmental tears (3.2%) LIS at the time of ACLR. The rate of reoperation/subsequent meniscectomy for medial meniscal repairs (14.8%) was significantly higher than for other medial treatments (hazard ratio 12.8; P &lt; .001). Patients who underwent meniscal repair with a concomitant tear in the opposite compartment (repair + PM/LIS) had the highest reoperation rates (16.7%) and lowest RTP rates (60%). IKDC scores were significantly lower for patients who underwent lateral meniscal repair (81.1 ± 15.3) compared with other types of lateral meniscal management ( P &lt; .027). ACL reinjury rate was not influenced by meniscal treatment. A higher preoperative Marx score increased the risk of reoperation in all groups. Conclusion: Stable meniscal tears LIS during ACLR had low reoperation rates and good patient-reported outcomes, including patients with bicompartmental tears. Medial meniscal repairs had the highest risk of reoperation, particularly when another tear was present in the lateral compartment. Lateral meniscal repairs were associated with lower IKDC scores compared with other lateral meniscal treatment strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Knowledge of the true social benefits of pro-environmental activities is limited due to the difficulty of evaluating and quantifying the non-market benefits of such actions. Valuing non-marketed compost benefits and impacts is difficult because they do not have market prices, as they are not bought and sold (i.e. traded) in markets. This article fills this gap by quantifying the non-market benefits of compost use in agriculture. As an initial contribution, this study applied revealed preference methods to quantify the economic values of important non-marketed compost benefits to plant and soil systems in tree and shrub nursery production. The estimated benefits were compared for compost produced using two windrow composting methods, namely: aerobic or thermophilic composting and fermentative or static pile inoculated composting. Specific compost benefits considered included: (i) medium in potting soil mix; (ii) Nitrogen Phosphorus and Potassim (NPK) nutrient supply; (iii) improved nursery plant yield/performance; (iv) disease, pest and weed control and (v) reduced branch pruning. Total economic value, aggregated for the compost benefit types considered, was lower for thermophilic compost applied (CAD$192 per tonne per year) than for fermentative compost (CAD$385 per tonne per year), due to lower fermentative compost production cost. Among the compost benefit types considered, improved nursery plant yield and performance accounted for the highest proportion of quantified benefits; 75% of total economic value for thermophilic compost and 93% for fermentative compost. Further studies considering all important compost benefits beyond those considered in this study, and compost use in other agricultural production systems will be useful.",

    "Abstract": "The Globally Harmonized System (GHS) is a crucial framework for chemical hazard communication, especially in protecting workers from skin sensitizers. A critical assessment of the principles, issues, and challenges around classification of skin sensitization in GHS is warranted. Classification of dermal sensitizers relies on a weight of evidence (WoE) approach that incorporates human, animal, and non-test data. However, current testing methods have limitations in sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy. Current test methods take into account the issue of potency and thresholds for sensitization. However, the focus on induction thresholds rather than induction and elicitation thresholds may create a gap in protecting already sensitized individuals since elicitation thresholds are in some cases lower than induction thresholds. While the sensitization process may take weeks or years, current test methods are largely acute in nature, potentially incapable of identifying all (chronic) sensitizers. Moreover, current methods used for classification of skin sensitizers only take into account the dermal route, whereas some chemicals may cause dermal sensitization through other routes, which presents a significant limitation, especially when considering non-animal testing methods. Finally, lack of UV irradiation in current methods may inadvertently miss potential photosensitizers, which may result in misclassification. Continuous refinement of testing methods and integrating novel approaches are essential to improve GHS classifications for skin sensitizers.",

    "Abstract": "ObjectivePsychosis is a significant neuropsychiatric symptom in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). While female APOE4 homozygotes are at the highest risk of psychosis, mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. We investigated whether epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) is associated with psychosis in individuals with AD and MCI, and whether this association varies by sex and APOE4 status.MethodsParticipants with clinical MCI or AD were drawn from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. EAA was calculated from DNA methylation data using the PhenoAge epigenetic clock, with the Horvath and Hannum clocks included for comparison. Psychosis status was defined as experiencing hallucinations or delusions at any time, based on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to assess associations between EAA and psychosis, including three-way interactions with sex and APOE4 carrier status.ResultsAmong 418 total participants (54 with psychosis, 84 female APOE4 carriers), EAA was not associated with psychosis for any of the 3 clocks utilized. However, a significant three-way interaction between sex, APOE4 carrier status, and PhenoAge EAA in predicting psychosis was observed (<i>P</i> = 0.013). Elevated PhenoAge EAA was associated with higher odds of psychosis in female APOE4 carriers (OR = 1.76 per 5-year, <i>P</i> = .025), whereas no associations were observed for other subgroups or clocks.ConclusionsPhenoAge EAA may serve as a novel biomarker of psychosis among female APOE4 carriers. These findings highlight the potential of second-generation epigenetic clocks for early risk stratification and biological investigations into psychosis in AD and MCI.",

Here we review recent advances in the understanding, prediction, and prevention of suicidal behaviors using such methods. Examples include the use of mathematical and computational modeling to build and test more precise theories of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, large-scale electronic databases to better detect and predict those at risk for suicide (e.g., health-care networks, social media, and other web-based platforms), smartphones and wearable biosensors to identify person-specific high-risk periods, and digital devices and platforms to deliver and test just-in-time adaptive interventions.

    "Abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) describes a severe, progressive, and ultimately fatal end-stage lung disorder in dogs and cats. The term IPF was coined in dogs and cats for 2 reasons: 1) the cause of the fibrosis at the time of diagnosis was unknown (i.e., presumed idiopathic); and 2) the condition was believed to resemble human IPF, the most common type of progressive fibrotic lung disease in people. However, pulmonary fibrosis in dogs and cats is not a single homogeneous disorder, does not consistently resemble all histologic features of human IPF, and is rarely exhaustively evaluated for an underlying cause. Fibrosis is a response to injury, and knowledge of the type of injury has critical implications for disease management, especially if identified before end-stage lesions occur. We offer an approach to a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including clinical, imaging, laboratory, and pathology data, which sets the stage for multidisciplinary discussions. Given that thoracic computed tomography (CT) is increasingly utilized to identify features compatible with pulmonary fibrosis in dogs and cats, we describe these CT patterns and their pitfalls. Diagnostic respiratory evaluations should investigate possible inciting causes, provide information about disease extent and severity, and identify comorbid disorders. Such evaluations will allow optimized therapy, including avoiding treatments that may have adverse effects or be overtly harmful. Importantly, although end-stage fibrotic lungs currently have no viable treatment, early recognition of known triggers of fibrosis could ultimately enable novel targeted therapy while there is still time to alter the clinical course.",

    "Abstract": "African horse sickness (AHS) is the only equine disease for which the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) gives official disease-free status, given that it poses a major threat to the equine industry. The disease is caused by AHS virus (AHSV; family Sedoreoviridae , taxon species Orbivirus alphaequi ), which is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is a rapid, sensitive detection method used in the diagnosis of AHS and the certification of animals as negative for AHSV for the purpose of movement. Genetic variability of AHSV may influence the accuracy of RT-qPCR detection methods because of possible mispriming and/or probe binding failures. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the current WOAH-recommended RT-qPCR assays for the detection of AHSV, namely the Agüero et al. and Guthrie et al. methods. Utilizing 150 AHSV-positive diagnostic samples, we performed in vitro analysis using both assays. The Agüero assay failed to detect AHSV in 13 samples (8.7% false-negative rate). The AHSV VP7 genes of the 13 negative samples, and publicly archived sequences were used to perform in silico analysis, and we incorporated minor changes into the primers and probes of modified Guthrie and modified Agüero assays.

    "Abstract": "Tritrichomonas foetus infection can cause reproductive losses and subsequent economic losses in cow-calf herds. Our objective was to determine if 0.9% sterile saline (saline) was noninferior to PBS as a transport medium for T. foetus reverse-transcription real-time PCR (RT-rtPCR) testing. Transport tubes were prepared with either 1.6 mL of PBS with preputial washing ( n = 30) or 1.6 mL of saline with preputial washing ( n = 30) and inoculated at 3 different concentrations of T. foetus organisms (high = 100 org/100 µL; moderate = 10 org/100 µL; low = 1 org/100 µL) for a total volume of 1.7 mL/tube. Samples were submitted to a diagnostic laboratory for RT-rtPCR analysis. The effect of concentration and medium on mean Ct values was tested using linear regression. Normalized means were used to conduct a noninferiority t -test, with a noninferiority margin of 1 Ct. For all analyses, α = 0.05. Mean Ct values (high = 18.5; moderate = 22.7; low = 30.4) differed by concentration ( p &lt;0.0001), whereas medium ( p = 0.67) and the interaction of medium and concentration ( p = 0.87) were not significant. The normalized mean Ct for PBS was 22.6 (min = 16.2; max = 27.0), and for saline was 22.8 (min = 20.9; max = 26.4). The normalized mean Ct of saline was noninferior to PBS ( p = 0.037). The use of saline as a transport medium for T. foetus RT-rtPCR should not affect Ct results.",

    "Abstract": "Child welfare caseworkers have significant decision-making authority, ultimately determining if allegations are substantiated, if a case should be opened for ongoing services, and if removal from the parental home is required. This research considers the role of caseworker turnover on these decisions, considering decisions for 372,968 unique screened-in reports assessed by 2,128 unique child welfare caseworkers in Wisconsin. Specifically, this study uses logistic regressions to estimate the likelihood of maltreatment substantiation, case opening, child removal, and the timeliness of the assessment as a function of the caseworker’s timeline to departure from the public child welfare field, net of case-related characteristics, caseworker demographics, and county/year fixed effects. Results indicate that the odds of substantiation, case opening, and timely assessment are lower as caseworkers near departure. Findings expand our understanding of the consequences of turnover, highlighting how it influences case decisions and providing insight into effects on child and family well-being.",

    "Abstract": "Maternal selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use is common during pregnancy and lactation. Changes in serotonin signaling may affect diversity and composition of microbes in the gut. Although research suggests SSRI drives microbial change, the extent to which the infant gut microbiome is affected is unknown. The infant gut microbiome is critical in early life for support of developmental health including early training of the immune system and metabolic programming. A total of N = 20 (10 SSRI, 10 control) maternal/infant dyads were enrolled in a pilot study. Thirty-six infant stool samples were collected at 1–2 and 4–6 weeks of life and sequenced using 16S rRNA sequencing. Investigative models included SSRI exposure as the primary variable of interest with infant feeding pattern and mode of delivery included as covariates. Maternal antidepressant use was not associated with infant alpha (within-sample) diversity. The SSRI use may shape beta (between-sample) diversity, particularly at weeks 4–6 of life ( p = .072). Increases in the genera Gemella , Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium were observed with SSRI exposure. Additionally, results reveal a SSRI-associated decrease in Lactobacillus . While this pilot study is not intended to provide conclusive evidence, it is an important step in informing future research directions. Results suggest a modest influence of maternal SSRI exposure on the infant gut microbiome. Future studies should seek to use techniques like metagenomics, providing functional information to assess for local or systemic health impact and ultimately, clinical relevance.",

    "Abstract": "AimsYouth receiving mental health care often face challenges related to romantic relationships, sexuality, and sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI). Although widely recognized as relevant, these topics are infrequently addressed in youth mental health care. This study explored how youth and mental health professionals experience discussions about sexuality and SOGI in clinical practice.MethodsIn-depth interviews were conducted with 21 youth aged 15-22 years receiving psychiatric care, alongside three focus groups with 20 mental health professionals, at a youth mental health center. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis.ResultsYouth described romance, sexuality, and identity as a normal part of life and closely linked to their well-being, while mental health difficulties often complicated relationships and identity processes. Professionals reported hesitation in raising these topics due to practical and personal barriers. Cultural and religious contexts shaped experiences, particularly for LGBTQ+ youth. Both groups emphasized the importance of addressing sexual side effects of psychotropic medication.ConclusionThis study highlights a gap between the recognized relevance of sexuality and SOGI and their discussion in everyday practice. Youth want these topics addressed in mental health care conversations. Bridging this gap requires proactive, youth-centered and culturally sensitive communication, supported by training and institutional attention.",

    "Abstract": "Children's and adolescents' mental health is increasingly affected by anxiety, stress, bullying, and self-harm, often intensified by social media and technological addictions. The lack of sufficient quantitative studies makes it difficult to measure the full extent of these problems, underlining the value of qualitative research to better capture key concerns. This study integrates perspectives from children, adolescents, parents, and professionals to provide a broad analysis, comparing overlaps and discrepancies in their views on mental health challenges, causes, and unmet needs. Twenty-one focus groups (<i>N</i> = 187) were conducted across four autonomous communities in Spain, involving representatives of all groups. Transcripts were coded and analyzed using MAXQDA 24 software to identify main themes. Children showed interest in mental health but noted that seeking psychological help is still taboo. Adolescents recognized the negative impact of excessive technology use and stressed the need for accessible psychological services. Parents highlighted the urgency of more resources and better coordination among institutions. Professionals emphasized the scarcity of preventive interventions and the lack of resources in the public system, which hinders adequate responses. The study concludes that comprehensive strategies are required to foster emotional education, expand school-based support, and improve coordination of resources from early childhood.",

    "Abstract": "Parental presence during pediatric resuscitation presents a complex challenge, often provoking mixed reactions from healthcare providers and families. This qualitative study explored how decisions about parental presence emerge from the experiences and perceptions of resuscitation teams and parents. An exploratory descriptive design was used across three pediatric hospitals. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews with 33 resuscitation team members and 20 parents who witnessed their child's resuscitation. Thematic analysis identified patterns for participant accounts. Participants shared their experiences and perceptions regarding decision-making about parental presence during pediatric resuscitation. Two main themes emerged: (1) Double-edged sword of parental presence (reluctance to allow parental presence; permission for parental presence) and (2) emotional weight of parents' decision to be present (decision to be present; indecision regarding presence). Findings highlight that parental presence involves balancing team readiness, environmental factors, and parental emotional state. Institutional policies should support offering presence as an option, reinforced by staff training and structured pre-briefing and debriefing to promote shared decision-making and strengthen family-centered care.",

    "Abstract": "This paper presents a comprehensive approach to dynamic identification and environmental effect filtering for the Exedra Hall at the Capitoline Museums in Rome. Measurements collected continuously over 1 year were analyzed using the Stochastic Subspace Identification (SSI) method to extract the modal parameters. A k-means clustering algorithm was employed to identify and track the first three natural frequencies. To address temperature-induced frequency variations, a feedforward Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was trained on 8 months of frequency and temperature data, enabling the isolation and removal of temperature effects from the identified frequencies. The filtered frequencies were extrapolated and validated against the identified data for the entire observation period. To improve robustness, physical plausibility, and extrapolation capability under seasonal transitions, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) constrained by finite-element-derived thermomechanical priors was additionally introduced. Finally, a model updating of the Finite Element Model (FEM), has been carried out to describe the temperature effect. This work contributes to Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) practices by integrating advanced identification techniques, machine learning, and model-based simulations.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Social media is a significant platform for health information. However, the quality and reliability of patient facing surgical content is uncertain. We evaluated the quality and reliability of TikTok and Instagram videos about three common general surgical procedures: laparoscopic appendicectomy; laparoscopic cholecystectomy; and inguinal hernia repair, and compared performance by platform, procedure, and creator type. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study of the top fifty results per procedure per platform. Videos were classified as useful, misleading, personal experience, or irrelevant and quality and reliability assessed with the Global Quality Score (GQS) and modified DISCERN (mDISCERN) score respectively. Results 300 videos, accruing 592,975 likes and 11,489 comments, were analysed. Videos were low in both quality and reliability across both platforms although higher on Instagram (GQS 1.95; mDISCERN 1.65) than TikTok (GQS 1.27; mDISCERN 0.33; both P &lt; .0001). 53/300 (17.7%) videos were judged to be misleading. Useful content was less frequent on TikTok than Instagram (14/150, 9.3% vs 82/150, 54.7%; P &lt; .0001). Professional content was deemed more useful than that of non professionals (54/117, 46.2% vs 42/183, 23.0%; P &lt; .0001) with higher quality and reliability scores (GQS 1.80 vs 1.49; mDISCERN 1.36 vs 0.76; both P &lt; .0001). Conclusions Surgical educational videos across popular social media platforms are low in quality and reliability. Patients should be wary of the risk of possible health misinformation. Clinicians and professional bodies should be aware of the growing popularity of social media and consider the production of evidence-based content on these platforms to disseminate credible information and counter misinformation.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Carpal tunnel release (CTR) is one of the most commonly performed hand surgeries, with both open and endoscopic techniques widely used. This study analyzes US historical trends in CTR utilization among Medicare beneficiaries and projects future procedural volumes through 2040. Methods: Medicare Part B National Summary data from 2000 to 2022 were used to estimate annual procedural volumes for open (Current Procedural Terminology [CPT] 64721) and endoscopic (CPT 29848) CTR. Adjustments were made to account for the increasing proportion of Medicare Advantage enrollees. Four forecasting models—log-linear, Poisson regression, negative binomial regression, and auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)—were applied. Model performance was evaluated using mean absolute error and root mean square error, with ARIMA selected for its superior predictive accuracy. Results: From 2000 to 2022, the annual volume of open CTR increased by 180%, while endoscopic CTR grew by 959%. Auto-regressive integrated moving average projections indicate that open CTR will continue to grow at an average annual rate of 2.0%, reaching an estimated 424 271 procedures by 2040. Endoscopic CTR is projected to increase at a faster rate of 2.42% annually, with a forecasted volume of 184 723 by 2040. Despite this growth, open CTR is expected to remain the predominant approach. Conclusions: Carpal tunnel release utilization has increased substantially in the United States, with endoscopic techniques growing at a faster rate than open CTR. Despite this trend, open CTR is projected to remain the predominant approach. Future research should assess the economic impact, patient-reported outcomes, and factors influencing the adoption of each technique.",

    "Abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health problem and the prevalence of CKD is substantially higher in older adults. Similarly insufficient sleep and abnormal sleep duration is more common among older adults. However, the relation between sleep duration and CKD has not been widely examined in older adults. We examined the association between long and short sleep duration and CKD in a large, multiethnic sample of older US adults aged ≥60 years ( N = 178 268) who participated in the 2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Sleep duration was categorized into 5 groups: ≤5, 6, 7, 8, and ≥9 h. Main outcome-of-interest was CKD (prevalence = 7.3%). We found both short and long sleep duration to be associated with higher prevalence of CKD. Compared to 7 hours of sleep (referent), the multivariable-adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of CKD was 1.32 (1.16-1.51) for 6 h of sleep, 1.55 (1.33-1.81) for ≤5 h of sleep, 1.27 (1.12-1.43) for 8 h of sleep, and 1.41 (1.23-1.62) for ≥9 h of sleep. The association was consistently present in subgroup analyses by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and body mass index. In conclusion, both short and long sleep durations are associated with CKD in older adults.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of postoperative sore throat, hoarseness, and cough after inflating the cuff using a manometer versus the traditional syringe-assisted cuff inflation method. Methods: This study involved 56 patients of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status (PS) classification system I and II undergoing elective laparoscopic surgeries under general anaesthesia. After obtaining ethics committee approval and informed consent, the patients were divided into two groups. In group A, cuff pressure was set to 25 cmH 2 O using a Portex ® cuff inflator. In group B, the cuff was inflated with room air using a 10-ml syringe; adequacy was assessed by palpation and auscultation. Postoperatively, the patients were monitored for sore throat, hoarseness, and cough, graded using the Harding and McVey scoring system. Results: The incidence of sore throat in the cuff manometer group was higher than in the syringe group at zero hour, possibly due to various factors. However, over time, the manometer group had more patients reporting no sore throat. A notable statistical and clinical difference was found between groups in sore throat and hoarseness. No statistical difference in cough was observed. Conclusion: Continuous cuff pressure monitoring during surgery reduces postoperative sore throat and hoarseness.",

We tease out the intricacies of leadership in the context of a professional hierarchy and by analyzing real time interactions, we demonstrate how leadership is collectively enacted in the sequential organization of talk. Our study provides further empirical evidence that fills the lacuna in understanding how collective and hierarchical leadership are intertwined in complex ways and thus responding to several calls in the leadership literature by analyzing these real-time interactions.",

    "Abstract": "Background Congenital malformations remain a major cause of under-five mortality in the United States, yet contemporary long-term trends and demographic disparities have not been comprehensively evaluated. This study examined national patterns in congenital malformation-related mortality among U.S. children under 5 years from 1999 to 2023. Methods Mortality data were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research (CDC-WONDER) Database, focusing on congenital malformations-related deaths among children aged under 5 years between 1999 and 2023 in the U.S. Cases were identified using ICD-10 codes from Q00 to Q89.9. Results This comprehensive analysis included a total of 143,931 deaths, demonstrating significant trends and disparities. The overall age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR) declined from 34.70 (95% CI: 33.86–35.54) in 1999 to 25.95 (95% CI: 25.21–26.68) in 2023, showing an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of −1.21 (95% CI: −1.50 to −1.02). Mortality was higher in males than in females. Across all races, the least decline was noted among NH American Indian or Alaska Natives. Non-metropolitan areas exhibited higher overall AAMR (34.80 [95% CI: 34.33–35.27]) compared to metropolitan areas (29.02 [95% CI: 28.85–29.19]). Conclusion The overall AAMR decreased from 1999 to 2023, with significantly higher deaths among males, rural regions and Alaskan Natives. These findings demonstrate an overall decline in mortality but persistent demographic and geographic inequities, highlighting the need for targeted public health and policy interventions to improve outcomes for vulnerable pediatric populations.",

    "Abstract": "Study DesignSystematic Review.ObjectivesA vast array of historical subaxial cervical spine fracture classifications. This initially comprised crude non-hierarchial schemes based upon mechanism on injury alone including compression, flexion, extension or lateral flexion. Allen and Ferguson advanced this by offering 6 categories of subaxial cervical spine injuries. Beyond this, Aebi and Nazarian appreciated the nuances of whether was was ligamentous injury in addition to pure bony involvement. These existing simplistic classifications failed to guide clinicians as to whether operative or non-operative management is appropriate. We describe the evolution of existing subaxial cervical spine classification systems and the development of the AO Cervical Spine Injury Classification System.MethodsA systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Databases was performed in keeping with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to identify all existing subaxial cervical spine classification systems.Results483 articles were initially retrieved which were distilled to 11 articles which pioneered individual classification systems. The AO Cervical Spine Injury Classification System resolves this with its hallmark 3 categories of escalating injury types from the type A compression injuries, to type B tension band injuries and finally the grossly unstable type C translation/displacement injuries. The addition of modifiers such as critical disc herniation or stiffening bony disease further strengthens the encompassing nature of this classification.ConclusionsThe AO Spine Cervical Spine Injury Classification System is a testament of the historical classification grading schemes but provides a structured means of evaluating injuries. This progressive system provides a foundation upon which objective scoring management methods can be developed to guide operative or non-operative management.",

    "Abstract": "Study DesignRetrospective study.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the association between preoperative patient expectations and postoperative satisfaction in elderly patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD), with particular emphasis on identifying potential dose-response relationships.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective cohort study of elderly patients (aged ≥65 years) with ASD undergoing thoracolumbar fusion surgery at our institution. Participants were stratified into satisfied and dissatisfied cohorts based on postoperative the North American Spine Society (NASS) satisfaction scores assessed at follow-up. Comprehensive data collection included demographic characteristics, radiological parameters, surgical variables, and perioperative outcomes. Propensity score matching using the nearest-neighbor method was applied to both groups of patients. Conditional logistic regression models adjusted for confounders were employed to assess associations. Nonlinear relationships were investigated through smoothed curve fitting with covariate adjustment. Threshold effects were analyzed using piecewise regression models, with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis validating optimal cutoff values.ResultsIn our study involving 234 elderly patients with ASD undergoing thoracolumbar fusion surgery between September 2019 and September 2022, we analyzed statistically significant differences between a case group (patient dissatisfied) and a control group (patient satisfied). We matched 82 patients in each group using nearest-neighbor matching. Despite this matching, there were still significant differences in key variables such as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), Age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (ACCI), complications, previous spine surgery, perioperative outcomes, and preoperative expectation (<i>P</i> < .05). In our fully adjusted model, we found that higher expectation scores were associated with lower satisfaction levels. Our curve-fitting analysis revealed that the risk of decreased patient satisfaction increased notably when the expectation score exceeded 53 points. Two-piecewise regression confirmed this threshold (OR = 0.29, 95% CI 0.17 ∼ 0.38, <i>P</i> < .001), corroborated by Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (AUC = 0.808, sensitivity 83.6%, specificity 63.2%).ConclusionOur findings identify 53 points as the critical threshold on preoperative expectation scales where satisfaction risk markedly escalates in elderly spinal deformity patients undergoing thoracolumbar fusion. The demonstrated dose-response relationship underscores the clinical importance of preoperative expectation management in this population.",

    "Abstract": "Cotard and Koro syndromes are rare psychiatric phenomena, with their concurrent occurrence being exceptionally uncommon, that too in context of the unusual history of bestiality. Cotard syndrome involves nihilistic delusions, such as beliefs of body part disappearance, while Koro is characterized by intense fear of penile retraction, often linked to thoughts of impending death. We report a case of a 32-year-old male with psychosis who presented with both syndromes following guilt related to a childhood history of bestiality. The patient developed persecutory delusions, delusions of guilt, beliefs of penile shrinkage (Koro-like), and nihilistic delusions involving his body and the world, finally exhibiting homicidal and suicidal behavior stemming from these fixed beliefs. This case highlights the complex interplay of guilt, nihilism and psychosis in context of bestiality, shaping rare syndromic presentations leading to extreme forms like homicidal and suicidal behavior. Recognizing such patterns is vital for accurate diagnosis, risk assessment, and tailored treatment planning in psychotic disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Dual diagnoses of psychosis and drug or alcohol problems (DDp) are prevalent, high-cost presentations, reliably associated with poorer outcomes and greater difficulty engaging with mental health services compared to either condition alone or other mental health problems. Engagement difficulties restrict access to recommended care that could improve outcomes, and thus are a priority treatment target. Contingency management (financial incentives for positive health behaviours, CM), peer support, and text messaging each improve engagement for psychosis or drug/alcohol problems. Despite the high potential to improve engagement and thus clinical and economic outcomes in DDp, their combined impact remains unevaluated in this poorly treated and hard-to-reach population. We plan a confirmatory trial to test, for the first time, the impact on engagement in DDp of adding CM to usual care alongside text message reminders and peer support. Methodological innovation is required to ensure adequate rates of recruitment, retention, and outcome completion; as well as standardised delivery of interventions, particularly CM, which will be delivered by peer support workers, and will target attendance, to improve engagement in recommended treatments. We comment here on the protocol for CoMPEERS (ISRCTN90137206), a study to test the feasibility of progressing this novel design to a full trial.",

    "Abstract": "This study reports the hydrothermal synthesis, characterization, and multifunctional performance of CuS/chitosan composites for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) dye under visible light and antimicrobial applications. The hydrothermal approach enabled the successful integration of CuS nanoparticles into the chitosan matrix, enhancing the crystallinity and morphology of the composite. The average crystallite size of the CuS/chitosan composite was found to be 20.8 nm, smaller than that of pure CuS (24.4 nm), indicating a stabilizing effect from the biopolymer. SEM analysis revealed that CuS nanoparticles are well-dispersed on the chitosan surface, while elemental mapping confirmed a high copper content (CuS) and significant carbon presence (chitosan incorporation). The CuS/chitosan composite achieved complete degradation of MB dye under visible light, outperforming bare CuS (84% degradation), and demonstrated good reusability over six cycles. Furthermore, the composite exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (19 mm inhibition zone) and Streptococcus aureus (20 mm), underscoring its promise for environmental remediation and biomedical applications.",

    "Abstract": "This study addresses the growing need for advanced thermal regulation by investigating the nonlinear flow behavior of a hybrid nanofluid within a porous medium under realistic physical conditions. The primary objective is to evaluate how slip effects, variable viscosity, and thermophoresis influence heat and mass transfer performance when multiple physical mechanisms act simultaneously. A comprehensive mathematical model is developed to describe the momentum, thermal, and concentration transport of a water-based hybrid nanofluid containing two distinct nanoparticle species, subjected to magnetic field effects, thermal radiation, and internal heat generation. The governing partial differential equations are transformed into a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations using similarity transformations and solved numerically via a shooting technique under appropriate boundary conditions. The novelty of this work lies in the combined consideration of slip velocity, thermophoresis-driven nanoparticle migration, and variable viscosity within a magnetohydrodynamic porous framework. The present study is relevant to practical applications, including microelectronics cooling, advanced heat exchangers, and maritime thermal management. The results indicate that increasing thermophoretic effects and internal heat generation significantly influence transport behavior, as enhanced particle migration reduces concentration gradients while internal heating shifts the heat transfer mechanism toward convection-dominated regimes. Further, the findings reveal that hybrid nanofluids exhibit enhanced thermal control capabilities, with thermophoresis and slip mechanisms playing a key role in improving heat and mass transfer rates, highlighting their potential for high-performance cooling applications.",

    "Abstract": "Differential methylation is a key epigenetic process contributing to cancer development. Most DNA methylation prediction methods rely on DNA sequences from the background reference genome, neglecting individual genetic variation, which limits their ability to capture methylation differences. To address this, we propose CMC-WDTK, a deep learning framework that combines a weight-sharing dual-branch Transformer with a Kolmogorov‒Arnold network (KAN) to integrate sequences flanking CpG sites and adjacent single nucleotide variation (SNV) information to predict methylation changes between DNA sequences. CMC-WDTK captures global and local features of both reference and variant sequences and models high-dimensional relationships, offering accurate predictions of methylation changes. CMC-WDTK accurately predicted DNA methylation changes in eight real datasets (AUC greater than 0.8 for all datasets), with strong generalizability across datasets. Method comparison and ablation analyses further confirm that CMC-WDTK outperforms existing approaches and that its full architectural design is essential for achieving robust and accurate methylation-change prediction across datasets. Additionally, it identified a repeated cytosine and guanine sequence motif that promotes increased methylation. CMC-WDTK is the first computational tool used to predict methylation changes between sequences, offering significant advancements in understanding and comparing DNA methylation across diverse datasets and biological conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Prior research has demonstrated sex-specific differences in hypertension (HTN). The gut microbiota (GM) and its metabolic functions have emerged as key players in the development of HTN. To explore potential sex-based heterogeneity in gut bacteria among hypertensive patients, we conducted this study with the aim of validating sex differences in the gut flora associated with HTN. Methods Here, we leveraged a metagenomic dataset comprising 106 fecal samples from a Chinese cohort of individuals with essential HTN to systematically analyze and compare alterations in the gut microbiome between male and female patients, as well as relative to a healthy control group. Results Our study confirmed a statistically significant difference in the β-diversity of GM between hypertensive patients and healthy controls. When the subjects were further stratified by sex, significant differences in the distribution of gut flora were observed exclusively in females, whereas none was noted between groups in males. It was observed that certain genera of GM exhibit negative correlations with blood pressure. Notably, the relative abundance of these bacterial genera, including Lachnospir a, Faecalibacterium , and Roseburia , was significantly diminished in female hypertensive patients. These organisms are primarily involved in the biosynthesis of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), with a notable emphasis on butyrate production. Ruminococcus gnavus was specifically enriched in hypertensive males, whereas certain bacteria, such as Lactobacillus , were notably depleted. The abnormality of the SCFAs-producing flora in female hypertensive patients may be related to that women are more likely to develop hypertensive organ damage. Conclusions The findings of our study indicate that GM dysbiosis is more significantly associated with HTN in females. Consequently, sex constitutes a critical factor in evaluating the role of intestinal flora in the pathogenesis of HTN.",

    "Abstract": "This study focused on the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence genes as well as plasmid replicons in three enterococci isolated from Bongo, a fermented dairy beverage from Uganda. They included Enterococcus (E.) faecium BM01, BM55 and BM70. They were tested against seventeen antibiotics using the disk diffusion and epsilon tests. Additionally, the DNA of the three isolates was extracted and subjected to Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS). AMR and virulence genes as well as plasmid replicons were determined by comparing the WGS data with the ResFinder database. Results indicated that the three isolates were resistant to all the antibiotics investigated. They all showed minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) at and above the highest concentrations tested (≥ 256 mg/mL for most antibiotics; ≥ 32 mg/mL for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin). All isolates had the aac(6')-li and msrC AMR genes, the acm and efaAfm virulence genes as well as the repUS15 plasmid replicon. Additionally, a stress gene, CIpL was observed in the three isolates. The results call for the need to strictly control food microbial contamination as well regulate the use of antibiotics both in human and veterinary use so as to improve food safety. This study provides preliminary evidence that a Ugandan fermented dairy beverage can harbor multidrug-resistant E. faecium carrying intrinsic AMR determinants, virulence-associated genes, and a plasmid replicon linked to plasmid replication, underscoring a potential food-safety concern that warrants broader surveillance.",

    "Abstract": "The giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera forms abundant underwater forests that hosts diverse and dynamic bacterial communities. In the sub-Antarctic Strait of Magellan, while spatial variability is known to influence these associations, the combined effects of temporal variability and intra-thallus differentiation remains poorly understood. In this study, 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding was used to characterize bacterial diversity and composition by comparing communities across two sampling dates (March, late austral summer, and August, austral winter), two different kelp blade types (apical vegetative and basal reproductive sporophylls), and three sampling sites along the Strait of Magellan (Bahía Buzo, San Gregorio and Buque Quemado) which differ in their environmental settings. Bacterial communities were primarily structured by spatial variation among sites, both in terms of richness and composition. Beta diversity analyses revealed strong site-level differentiation in both sampling periods, while blade-type effects on community composition were only evident in August, indicating a date-related modulation of host-associated bacterial assemblages. Alpha diversity showed few differences related with blade types, whereas spatial variation, particularly in bacterial richness, was more pronounced and varied across dates. Furthermore, the global core microbiota was very small, consisting of only a few ubiquitous taxa consistently associated with Macrocystis pyrifera: Persicirhabdus (Verrucomicrobiia), Thalassotalea (Gammaproteobacteria), and an unclassified member of the family Flavobacteriaceae. Beyond this minimal shared core, core composition varied with blade type, sampling site and date, highlighting the combined influence of these factors on kelp-associated bacterial communities from a remote and understudied sub-Antarctic region.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The composition of gut microbiota is jointly determined by the host’s food habit, ecological niche, and genetic background, serving as a direct reflection of the host’s adaptation to its environment and evolutionary pressures. To investigate the distinct adaptation mechanisms of four sympatric small mammal species in the Hengduan Mountains region, this study compared the environmental adaptation strategies of endemic and alien species. This study collected ten wild specimens each of the Eothenomys miletus , Eothenomys oliter , Tupaia belangeri , and Apodemus chevrieri from Yunlong County, Yunnan Province. Using 16SrRNA gene sequencing technology, we analyzed the gut microbial composition, abundance, and community structure across species, investigating the distinct gut microbial community characteristics between the endemic species ( E. miletus and E. oliter ) and the alien species ( T. belangeri and A. chevrieri .). Results indicate: E. miletus and E. oliter possess complex and diverse gut microbial communities with plant-degrading functions. These communities with sparse interactions are capable of utilizing multiple plant sources for nutrition and exhibit strong resilience against environmental disturbances. In contrast, T. belangeri and A.chevrieri exhibit simple, specialized, yet tightly cooperative omnivorous gut microbial communities. While capable of utilizing diverse food resources within specific adaptive environments, they demonstrate extreme specificity in adaptation to particular habitats or survival strategies and are relatively sensitive to external disturbances. Furthermore, the E. miletus , widely distributed across the Hengduan Mountains, its gut bacterial community is dominated by stochastic processes. In contrast, the T. belangeri shows a positive correlation with various gut bacteria associated with omnivorous characteristics. The distinction between these two distinct environmental adaptation strategies is particularly pronounced. In summary, Among these four sympatric small mammal species in the Hengduan Mountains, the gut microbiota of endemic and alien species showed high similarity respectively and exhibited convergence.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Iatrogenic left main coronary artery (LMCA) dissection and stent dislodgement are rare but potentially life-threatening complications of coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. Their simultaneous occurrence is extremely uncommon and poses significant technical challenges. Case presentation A 62-year-old man with a history of hypertension developed LMCA dissection accompanied by chest pain during coronary angiography performed via the right radial approach, caused by non-coaxial catheter engagement. To stabilize the dissection, an additional femoral access was obtained. A drug-eluting stent implanted from the circumflex artery to the LMCA adhered to the balloon and migrated retrogradely, becoming lodged at the tip of the guiding catheter. Because retrieval attempts were unsuccessful, the dislodged stent was intentionally implanted into the right brachial artery to prevent distal embolization. The patient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the procedure and was discharged without complications. Conclusions This case represents the first reported instance of simultaneous LMCA dissection and complete retrograde stent dislodgement successfully managed percutaneously without the need for surgical intervention. Prompt recognition, access modification, and careful device manipulation were essential for achieving a favorable outcome.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objectives Comorbid depression is highly prevalent in very old adults hospitalized for acute medical illness. We have previously shown that immediate intervention with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) effectively reduces symptoms of depression and anxiety. The present study examines the long-term course and the effect of delayed intervention. Design Randomized, controlled cross-over trial of group CBT. Setting and participants We recruited in-patients of a geriatric university department ≥ 65 years with depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADS ≥ 7). Intervention took place after hospital discharge in a day care setting. Methods Patients were randomized to an immediate active intervention group (II) or a waiting list control group with delayed intervention (DI). II patients were invited immediately after discharge to 10 to 15 weekly behavioral group therapy sessions. After 4 months (T1), DI patients switched to active intervention, while II were followed under control conditions. Final evaluation took place after 12 months (T2). Primary endpoint was improvement in HADS. Results 56 patients (82.0 ± 6.2 years, HADS 18.8 ± 7.0) were randomized to II, 99 patients (81.9 ± 5.9 years, HADS 18.1 ± 8.3) to DI. II patients improved significantly at T1 (HADS 10.4 ± 5.2). Improvement was sustained under control conditions at T2 (11.9 ± 7.8). DI patients did not improve on waiting list (T1 22.9 ± 8.3), but after initiation of active treatment (T2 16.0 ± 8.5) (ANOVA: F = 3.75, p = 0.026). Concomitantly, functional parameters such as Barthel Index and Timed-Up-and-Go differed significantly between groups with better courses in DI patients. Among II patients, 4 (7.1%) deceased and 2 (3.6%) were newly admitted to a nursing home, among DI, 15 (15.2%) and 10 (10.1%) respectively. Conclusions and implications Cognitive behavioral group therapy yields sustained improvement of depressive symptoms in very old geriatric patients, if administered in a multimodal approach immediately following hospitalization for acute medical illness. Concomitant with improvement of depressive symptoms, patients benefit in terms of functional status and medical outcome. Trial registration www.germanctr.de ; DRKS 00004728; February 12, 2013.",

    "Abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel compartmental model to capture the transmission dynamics of measles, incorporating both single- and double-dose vaccination strategies. The model accounts for differential vaccine efficacies between partially and fully vaccinated individuals, providing a more realistic representation of population immunity. To quantify and forecast the future trajectory of measles in Texas, we calibrated our model using the 2025 measles outbreak data from Texas, USA, from January 20 to May 27, 2025. In addition, we employed time series forecasting approaches, Facebook Prophet and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), to predict daily new measles cases. Results from the forecasting analysis reveal that the Prophet model outperformed the GRU model based on standard performance metrics. Both models suggest that measles will persist in Texas with an estimated average of 1-2 (95% CI, 1-2 ), daily new cases per day until August 30, 2025, unless additional public health interventions are implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of achieving and maintaining high vaccination coverage to prevent future outbreaks and mitigate the long-term risk of endemic measles. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers and health authorities aiming to strengthen measles control strategies in both endemic and non-endemic regions of Texas, USA.Clinical trialNot applicable.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Early pregnancy loss (EPL) is a global public health concern with significant physical and psychological effects on individuals and society. The specific etiology of many EPL cases is not well understood, and first trimester maternal diet may play a role in EPL occurrence. This study aimed to examine the differences in first trimester maternal nutrient intake, nutritional habits and nutritional knowledge levels between healthy pregnant women and women who experienced EPL. Methods A single center retrospective case–control study was conducted at a public hospital in Istanbul, Turkey between May–October 2024. The case group comprised 65 women who experienced first-time pregnancy loss. The control group included 65 healthy pregnant women in the first trimester without a previous PL history, with both groups matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and parity. Data were collected from the participants regarding their general information, dietary habits, the Quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (QFFQ), and the Nutrition Knowledge Level Scale for Adults (NKLSA). Dietary nutrient intakes were evaluated on the basis of the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) values and compared between the two groups. To further investigate the link between specific dietary nutrient intakes and EPL risk, adjusted binary logistic regression models were employed. Results The mean age of the participants was 28.5 years, and their mean BMI was 24.20 kg/m 2 . The dietary intake of carbohydrates, dietary fiber, monounsaturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids, folate, vitamin C, potassium, iodine and total minerals were statistically higher in the control group ( p &lt; 0.05). Dietary vitamin D and cholesterol intake and the omega-6/omega-3 ratio were greater in the case group without statistical significance ( p &gt; 0.05). The control group presented significantly higher proportions of dietary supplement use, regular consumption between meals, and higher daily meal number ( p &lt; 0.05). Adjusted binary logistic regression analysis revealed negative correlations between total dietary fiber intake (continuous and Q3/Q4) and EPL risk in all models, even after adjusting for all potential confounders ( p &lt; 0.05). There was no statistically difference regarding nutrition knowledge level between two groups ( p &gt; 0.05). Conclusions This study contributes to the literature by showing the protective role of maternal nutritional status in the first trimester against EPL risk. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Field workers or research assistants (RAs) are commonly employed within community-based trials. Training provided for RAs, however, is often limited to the technical elements of research, with little-to-no training to help them navigate the ethical challenges they may encounter while working in community-based settings. The main objective of this study was to explore the challenges faced by RAs working as part of a novel housing initiative, to describe the impact these challenges had on their work and wellbeing, and to outline approaches taken by RAs in facing these challenges. Methods A qualitative interview guide was piloted and refined for key informant interviews (KIIs) with research assistants (RAs) working on the Star Homes intervention in Mtwara, southern Tanzania. A total of 16 KIIs were conducted with all available RAs. These data were supplemented with 47 documents that comprised 31 case studies and 16 observation notes. The interviews were conducted in Kiswahili, audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and translated into English. All transcripts underwent line-by-line coding in NVivo and were analysed using thematic analysis. Results Principal challenges included difficulties related to RAs’ roles and responsibilities, including having to travel long distances for data collection. Most prominent, however, were ethical challenges, including witnessing the suffering of study participants. RAs unanimously expressed being most distressed by encountering children who were neglected or subjected to abuse, including several cases of child sexual abuse (CSA), as part of their work. Conclusions Clear engagement strategies with communities and authorities are essential to support RAs in reporting and follow-up. Training and resources are urgently needed to prepare field staff, mitigate moral distress, and protect research participants from harmful behaviours.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Although many studies have investigated COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care facilities (LTCFs), evidence that combines multiple clustered levels is scarce. We aimed to describe individual, LTCF, and regional-level factors associated with COVID-19 infections. Methods We conducted a nationwide study using insurance claims data from Germany between 1st October 2020 and 31st March 2021. The sample comprised 284,186 residents over 60 years in 9,869 LTCFs across all of Germany’s 400 districts. We used multilevel logistic regression to model associations between individual, LTCF, and district-level factors, and the probability of a COVID-19 infection. Results A total of 44,042 (15.5%) COVID-19 infections were recorded during the study period. On the individual level, male sex (OR 1.15; 95% CI 1.12–1.18), dementia (OR 1.09; CI 1.06–1.11), medium-severe care dependency level 3 and 4 (OR 1.17; CI 1.12–1.22 / OR 1.21; CI 1.16–1.26) were associated with greater risk of infection. At the LTCF level, infection risks increased with the mean age of residents (OR 1.09; CI 1.03–1.15) and higher resident numbers (OR 1.20; CI 1.14–1.27). On the district level, a higher proportion of public LTCFs was associated with lower infection risks (OR 0.90; CI 0.84–0.97), while a higher mean number of residents (OR 1.16; CI 1.05–1.28), and the district-level SARS-CoV-2 incidence rate among the general population (OR 1.54; CI 1.41–1.67) was associated with higher risks. A cross-level interaction between facility size and COVID-19 prevalence was not significant ( p &gt; 0.5). Conclusion We found evidence of individual, facility, and regional levels factors associated with COVID-19 infections among older adults in LTCFs. Future measures to combat infections, outbreaks, and pandemics should take an orchestrated multilevel approach.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Academic performance is often highly prioritized among college students, sometimes at the expense of their health. Despite growing interest in this relationship, limited research with college students has explored how diet quality (DQ) varies by gender, first-generation status, and grade-point average (GPA). The purpose of this paper was to: (1) examine the relationship between DQ and academic performance in college students and (2) identify potential differences based on gender, first-generation status, and varying GPAs. Methods In this cross-sectional study, undergraduate students ( n = 301), mean age 21.2 (SD ± 2.49), completed the validated Short Healthy Eating Index (sHEI) based on the USDA’s Healthy Eating Index (HEI) per 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans , to examine DQ. Academic performance was assessed using self-reported GPA. Students were predominantly non-Hispanic White (63%), Female (61%), and 75% had at least one parent graduate college. Descriptive statistics, correlation, and one-way ANOVAs were used to analyze the data using SPSS V.29. GPA was categorized into 3 groups: high, mid, and low GPA groups. Results were significant when p &lt; 0.05. Results DQ scores ranged from 21% to 68%, with a mean of 44% (SD: ±2.494). There were no significant associations between GPA and total DQ. However, significant associations were found between gender and specific dietary components. Further, total protein scores were greater among students with a high GPA compared to low and mid-GPA groups (F = 5.214, p = 0.006). Plant-based protein was greater among students who had at least one parent graduate college compared to first-generation students (F = 3.435, p = 0.034). Students living independently had lower total protein scores compared to those living with family (F = 4.841, p = 0.029). Additionally, students without a current job had higher dairy scores than those employed (F = 4.280, p = 0.039). Conclusion Overall, college students reported poor DQ; however, personal (e.g., gender) and environmental factors (e.g., living arrangements) were associated with one’s DQ. Further investigation is needed to facilitate the development of effective interventions that encourage healthier dietary habits among college students to improve their overall health and wellness.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) plays a critical role in the rapid detection of infectious pathogens. We aimed to analyze the clinical characteristics of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in children without HIV infection and to evaluate the performance of mNGS in distinguishing P. jirovecii colonization from true infection. Methods A multicenter, retrospective analysis was conducted on critically ill, non-HIV-infected pediatric patients who tested positive for P. jirovecii via mNGS analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Group differences were assessed using Mann–Whitney U-tests (for continuous data) and chi-square tests (for categorical data). Discriminatory performance was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results A total of 59 HIV-negative children (age range: 2 months to 14 years) from four children’s hospitals were included and classified into two groups based on P. jirovecii status: P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP; n = 51) and P. jirovecii colonization (PCC; n = 8). Compared with the PCC group, the PCP group had significantly higher serum C-reactive protein levels and median P. jirovecii read counts in mNGS (both P &lt; 0.05). The optimal threshold value for discriminating P. jirovecii infection from colonization appeared to be 556 reads (sensitivity, 77.6%; specificity, 100.0%). Eighteen patients (35.3%) in the PCP group died. Compared with survivors, these patients were significantly younger, had lower T-cell subset counts (CD3 + , CD4 + , and CD8 + ), and a higher prevalence of primary immunodeficiency (all P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions BALF mNGS analysis may have utility for differentiating between colonization and infection by P. jirovecii , warranting further investigation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The quality of oral cancer resection is extremely important for patient outcomes, such as local control and survival. However, most current simulators either provide only rater-dependent feedback or are not compatible with electrosurgery. Therefore, we developed an electrosurgical simulation task for oral cancer resection that provides objective quantitative metrics and collected initial validity evidence. Methods We developed a soft tissue simulation task using a plant-derived model that supports electrosurgery. As quantitative measures demonstrating “ensuring appropriate margins” in oral cancer resection and “maintaining safety” during electrosurgery, we employed nine-directional margin error distance and tumor bed carbonization degree measured using a spectral colorimeter. As validity evidence of the task, 10 expert surgeons completed a questionnaire about the task. In addition, five experts and 12 novices performed the task, and quantitative data obtained from their performance was used for evaluation. Results The replication of oral cancer resection was highly evaluated (4.4 out of 5 points), and quantitative measures for evaluating the skills of surgeons (4.8 out of 5 points) were agreed upon by experts. The internal consistency of the measures was good (Cronbach's alpha: 0.803). Compared to novices, experts had smaller margin errors (0.79 mm vs 2.45 mm), lower carbonization (ΔE: 2.33 vs 8.70), faster resection times, and fewer grasping attempts (all P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion This user-friendly plant-derived simulation task is compatible with electrosurgery and provides objective quantitative performance metrics. These findings support its use as a practical assessment tool for formative feedback in simulation-based training.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) is profoundly transforming the healthcare landscape, presenting unprecedented opportunities to enhance patient care and clinical outcomes. However, the rapid integration of AI technologies has raised significant ethical concerns, requiring rigorous scrutiny to ensure their responsible and equitable use. This study aimed to explore the ethical considerations and strategies related to the implementation of AI in healthcare through a systematic review. A systematic search identified 243 publications published between 2019 and 2025 that were initially identified. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 22 papers were selected for final synthesis to assess ethical concerns and strategies related to AI in healthcare. The analysis identified key ethical concerns, categorizing them into six distinct groups: (1) Transparency and Trust, (2) Bias and Fairness, (3) Privacy and Data Security, (4) Accountability and Responsibility, (5) Ethical and Moral, (6) Regulatory and Legal. Additionally, several ethical strategies were identified in the implementation of AI systems, including adherence to ethical principles, standards, and frameworks; transparency and bias mitigation; monitoring and auditing of AI systems; and stakeholder involvement and governance in decision-making processes. This review emphasizes the importance of addressing these ethical concerns to ensure the successful implementation of AI technologies in healthcare. The findings provide valuable insights and recommendations for stakeholders, including developers, healthcare professionals, and policymakers, to guide the ethical deployment of AI decision support systems in healthcare.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Evidence links emotional labor to burnout among hospital workers, yet most studies focus on nurses or aggregate diverse allied health occupations into a single group. This cross-sectional secondary analysis examined whether job satisfaction mediates the association between emotional labor and burnout, and whether the mediation pathway differs by occupation among hospital-based healthcare workers. Methods We analyzed data from a standardized self-administered survey conducted in July 2022 across six hospitals under the Korea Veterans Health Service. Of 570 eligible healthcare workers, 290 responded (response rate 50.9%), including clinical laboratory scientists, radiologic technologists, physical therapists, and dental hygienists. Emotional labor, job satisfaction, and burnout were assessed using validated questionnaires. We applied generalized structural equation modeling to test an occupation-specific moderated mediation model (emotional labor → job satisfaction → burnout), adjusting for age, sex, employment status, weekly working hours, self-rated health status, and hospital. Results Dental hygienists showed the highest mean emotional labor and burnout levels. In the overall mediation model, higher emotional labor was associated with lower job satisfaction (a = − 0.765; 95% CI − 0.857 to − 0.674) and higher burnout both directly (c′ = 0.340; 95% CI 0.261 to 0.420) and indirectly via job satisfaction (indirect effect = 0.096; 95% CI 0.050 to 0.143), corresponding to 22.1% mediation of the total effect (total effect = 0.436; 95% CI 0.357 to 0.516). In occupation-specific models, the indirect effect through job satisfaction was significant for clinical laboratory scientists and radiologic technologists, whereas the direct effect of emotional labor on burnout remained significant across all four occupations. Conclusion Emotional labor was positively associated with burnout among healthcare workers, and job satisfaction accounted for a meaningful portion of this association. The mediation pathway differed by occupation, suggesting that burnout mitigation strategies may benefit from occupation-tailored approaches, with particular attention to strengthening job satisfaction where mediation is evident.",

    "Abstract": "Thunderstorm asthma (TA) refers to a phenomenon characterized by sudden onset, large-scale outbreaks, and potentially fatal acute exacerbations of asthma. Despite accumulating epidemiological evidence, its cellular and molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Recent studies have proposed a core framework involving \"environmental triggers-epithelial barrier damage-immune dysregulation.\" During thunderstorms, high humidity and strong convection can cause pollen to hydrate and rupture into sub-pollen particles (SPPs) smaller than 2.5 μm, which may further combine with other pollutants such as particulate matter ≤ 2.5 μm(PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) to form bioaerosols capable of penetrating small airways. These factors can lead to damage of the airway epithelial barrier, with sequential cellular and molecular pathophysiological changes including downregulation of various tight junction proteins in the epithelial barrier, imbalance of mucociliary clearance function, and upregulated secretion of epithelial alarmins such as interleukin (IL)-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). This results in increased disease severity through activation of innate and adaptive immunity (e.g., type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2)/T helper 2(Th2) axis activation leading to immunoglobulin E(IgE) upregulation, eosinophil activation, and mast cell degranulation; Th17-mediated neutrophilic inflammation; and toll-like receptor(TLR)-mediated innate immune processes and mucosal inflammation) and enhancement of intrinsic susceptibility factors (e.g., TLR gene polymorphisms and abnormal expression, DNA methylation and histone modifications, as well as microbiome-host interactions). According to research in meteorology, exposomics, and molecular immunology, we believe that airway epithelial barrier dysfunction and immune dysregulation play significant roles in TA. Future translational directions primarily involve establishing a population stratification and early warning system through combinations of meteorological factors with allergens/pollutants, thereby enhancing public protection and health management efforts to improve the early warning, prevention, and clinical management of TA.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Compliance with evidence-based treatment guidelines, supported by quality-assured parasitological diagnosis, is the mainstay of malaria case-management in Nigeria. However, despite increased attention, the quality of inpatient paediatric and adult, test-and-treat malaria case-management, and routine accuracy of malaria microscopy, has rarely been examined in public and private hospitals. Methods A cross-sectional assessment was undertaken at 18 public and private hospitals in September 2024 in Kano State, Nigeria. Data collection included hospital assessments, interviews with inpatient health workers, review of all paediatric and medical ward admission files for August 2024, and re-checking of routine malaria slides archived during the 3-month post-assessment period. Descriptive analyses included 18 hospitals, 72 health workers, 2,814 suspected malaria admissions, and 211 malaria slides. Results Nearly all hospitals (94.4%) provided parasitological diagnostic services (microscopy or RDT) and stocked recommended antimalarials (injectable artesunate and ACT). Most health workers had received training on severe malaria (73.6%), but only 16.7% received supportive supervision. The composite test-and-treat performance was 39.3%, higher for children than adults (45.7% vs 26.5%) and in public compared to private hospitals (39.8% vs 30.8%). Among suspected malaria patients, 73.7% were tested on admissions and 90.2% of those with severe malaria were treated with artesunate. Children, compared to adults, were more commonly tested (79.8% vs 61.7%) and treated with artesunate (93.5% vs 80.1%). Patients in private hospitals, compared to public, were more often tested (84.3% vs 73.0%) but less frequently treated with artesunate (73.1% vs 91.2%). Only 30.0% of artesunate-treated patients were prescribed ACT—more commonly among adults than children (48.3% vs 23.0%) and in private than in public hospitals (89.2% vs 26.9%). ACT use for admitted non-severe cases was rare (2.4%), whereas non-compliance with test negative results was high (75.8%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of routine microscopy compared to expert readings were 93.2%, 42.5%, 29.9% and 95.9%, respectively. Conclusions Inpatient compliance with malaria test-and-treat guidelines varied between performance tasks, age groups, and hospital sectors. Clinicians can be confident in negative slides but should be cautious with positive results. Quality assurance of malaria diagnosis and continuous clinical and laboratory quality improvement interventions, with enhanced linkages, are needed.",

    "Abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive malignancies of the central nervous system. Gemcitabine (GEM), a pyrimidine analogue with broad-spectrum anticancer activity, can activate the cGAS-STING pathway and alleviate the immunosuppressive microenvironment of GBM. However, its clinical application is hampered by the formidable challenge of crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accumulating at the tumor lesion. Herein, a dual-responsive biomimetic nanoprodrug (RMM@GEM NPs) was exploited to enhance the efficient BBB penetration and target cargo delivery by functionalization of glioblastoma cell membranes (MM) camouflaging and further targeting peptide RAP modification. After its selective accumulation at glioma lesion, RMM@GEM NPs accelerates GEM release under the tumor pathological stimuli of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and acidic microenvironment to robustly activate the STING signaling cascades (increased p-STING, p-TBK1, p-IRF3, and p-NF-κB). Simultaneously, cyclodextrin-mediated cholesterol depletion further suppresses PD-L1 expression and alleviates T-cell exhaustion. These findings highlight RMM@GEM NPs as a promising strategy to enhance immune responses in \"cold\" tumor, providing a potential candidate for efficient and safe immunotherapy in GBM.",

The system integrates resveratrol (Res) and mitochondria-targeted cerium oxide nanozymes (TPP-CeO<sub>2</sub>) within a thermo-responsive hydrogel matrix, enabling sustained transdermal delivery and enhanced local drug retention. Network pharmacology and transcriptomic analyses identified 36 key targets and highlighted the ROS/mTOR/HIF-1α axis as a critical pathway in neutrophil regulation. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and neutrophils as key cellular contributors to psoriasis pathogenesis. CMH@lip@Res-TCeO<sub>2</sub> effectively suppressed mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, inhibited mTOR/HIF-1α activation, reduced neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and alleviated keratinocyte dysfunction. In IMQ-induced psoriasis-like mice, the treatment significantly decreased inflammatory cytokine expression and improved histopathological features. These findings demonstrate that CMH@lip@Res-TCeO<sub>2</sub> exerts multi-level regulation of oxidative stress, metabolism, and inflammation, offering a promising nanotherapeutic strategy for psoriasis and other chronic inflammatory skin disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Kidney stones are among the most common renal diseases with high global incidence and recurrence rates, with calcium oxalate (CaOx) stones constituting 65.9% to 80% of all cases. Minimally invasive surgery remains the primary approach for kidney stones, while limited progress has been made in the drug therapy for CaOx kidney stones over the recent years. The limitations of traditional drug therapy, such as renal toxicity and poor targeting, along with an elusive pathogenesis of CaOx kidney stones, have prevented its widespread clinical application. Renal tubular epithelial cells injury has been reported to play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of CaOx kidney stones. Nanozymes with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have the potential to treat CaOx crystal-induced kidney injury. Moreover, as a key stone inhibitor, potassium citrate is widely used to inhibit stone formation due to its ability to modify urinary chemistry. Herein, we designed citrate-coated Prussian blue nanozyme hitchhiking on the neutrophils (NM@CPBzyme) with injured kidney targeting capability and good biosafety. The results showed that NM@CPBzyme alleviated CaOx crystal-induced kidney injury and CaOx crystals deposition. On the one hand, NM@CPBzyme has been demonstrated to not only suppress oxidative stress but also chelate calcium ions, thereby facilitating crystal dissolution. On the other hand, NM@CPBzyme could mitigate neutrophil infiltration, NETosis and inhibit pyroptosis in vitro and in vivo. In addition, RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis further showed that NM@CPBzyme ameliorates CaOx crystal-induced kidney injury via oxidative stress and neutrophil mediated inflammatory response. In summary, our results revealed that NM@CPBzyme is a novel strategy for protecting against CaOx crystal-induced kidney injury.",

    "Abstract": "Liver Cancer, one of the most lethal cancers in adults, is distinguished by its aggressive invasion, distinctive tumor microenvironment (TME) and resistance to standard treatments, posing challenges. The TME and fibrotic extracellular matrix (ECM) hampers effective drug distribution; hence, new developments in therapeutics have brought creative solutions to these problems. To temporarily breach these barriers and enable targeted treatment, various dynamic therapies using stimuli such as focused Ultrasound, light, chemical reactions, mechanical stress, microwave induction and magnetic fields have demonstrated great promise in inducing localized and spatiotemporal therapeutic effects. This comprehensive review highlights the therapeutic mechanisms, including both chemical and biological effects and elucidates the therapeutic promise of emerging nanomedicine across individual modalities such as sonodynamic therapy (SDT), photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT), supported by preclinical evidence. Thereafter, promising combinatorial dynamic strategies with superior therapeutic effects are outlined. Furthermore, emerging next-generation modalities, including piezodynamic therapy (PZDT), microwave dynamic therapy (MWDT) and magnetodynamic therapy (MDT), with their therapeutic perspectives are discussed in detail. Although these strategies employing emerging nanomedicines have shown remarkable therapeutic potential for clinical translation, controlling physical stimulation and ensuring nanoparticle biocompatibility remain challenging. Continued innovations in medicine and chemistry will be essential for transforming dynamic strategies into clinically viable strategies for liver oncology.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is one of the most serious complications of diabetes and lack effective treatment options. Although platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGFB) has been approved for the treatment of diabetic wounds, it is difficult to sustainably deliver PDGFB to the wound site of DFU owing to its poor stability and easy degradation. To address these limitations, we developed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated PDGFB circular RNA (LNP-circPDGFB) formulation designed to achieve sustained local expression and release of PDGFB for enhanced diabetic wound healing. The therapeutic circRNA was synthesized via in vitro transcription (IVT), followed by microfluidic encapsulation into ionizable LNPs to generate LNP-circPDGFB. LNP-circPDGFB facilitated highly efficient and prolonged expression of PDGFB both in vitro and in vivo. It exhibited pleiotropic effects by promoting the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells and fibroblasts, as well as the angiogenesis of vascular endothelial cells. In diabetic mice, a single administration of LNP-circPDGFB could significantly accelerate diabetic wound healing and improved histopathological outcomes without obvious immunogenicity. Single cell RNAseq results also highlighted the potential of LNP-circPDGFB to promote proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix deposition of fibroblasts and vascular repair and angiogenesis of vascular endothelial cells. Taken together, we established LNP-circPDGFB as a promising “single-dose, long-acting” therapeutic platform for DFU treatment, addressing key limitations of current therapies. By leveraging the stability of circRNA and efficient LNP delivery, this approach not only enhances diabetic wound healing but also offers a versatile framework for protein delivery in regenerative medicine.

    "Abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury is a critical contributor to adverse outcomes following stroke. During I/R injury, excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to various forms of neuronal cell death. Moreover, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) significantly hinders the delivery and efficacy of many neuroprotective agents. Given selenium's crucial role in mitigating brain ischemia, we developed a selenium-based nanozyme encapsulated in glutathione (GSH)-conjugated liposomes to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we encapsulated selenium-doped carbon dot nanozymes (Se-CDs) within GSH-conjugated liposomes (Se-CD@LP-GSH) to enable targeted delivery and enhance therapeutic efficacy in ischemic stroke. This system demonstrates effective ROS scavenging capabilities both in vitro and in vivo, while also enhancing the biocompatibility of Se-CDs and their ability to cross the BBB. In the tMCAo model, Se-CD@LP-GSH reduces the neuronal death and infarct area following cerebral I/R injury, and promotes improvements in spatial learning ability and sensorimotor function. Mechanistically, Se-CD@LP-GSH promoted the upregulation of GPX4, an essential selenoprotein, thereby preserving mitochondrial function and suppressing ROS generation Consequently, the reduced ROS levels inhibit NLRP3/GSDMD-mediated neuronal pyroptosis during cerebral I/R injury. By improving the brain-targeting ability of Se-CDs via GSH-functionalized liposomal delivery, our work elucidates their neuroprotective efficacy and mechanistic basis, thus providing a translationally relevant strategy for ischemic stroke therapy.",

    "Abstract": "Efficient and uniform delivery of nanomedicine into deep tumors remains challenging due to the limited targeting efficiency and the dense stromal barrier of solid tumors. Here, we report a bacterial biohybrid platform that integrates tumor-tropic bacteria with photoresponsive nanomedicine to achieve deep intratumoral drug delivery through active bacterial locomotion, passive nanoparticle diffusion, and photo-controlled spatiotemporal release. This biohybrid is constructed by conjugating attenuated Salmonella typhimurium VNP20009 with polyglycerol-decorated hollow mesoporous ruthenium nanoparticles, which act simultaneously as photothermal agents and nanocarriers co-encapsulating thermosensitive 1-tetradecanol and chemotherapeutic DOXorubicin. Guided by bacterial chemotaxis, the biohybrid actively colonizes the hypoxic and deep tumor regions inaccessible to conventional nanomedicines. Upon near-infrared irradiation, localized photothermal heating detaches nanoparticles from the bacterial surface, converting transport from active bacterial locomotion to passive interstitial diffusion, and simultaneously melts the thermosensitive 1-tetradecanol to trigger pulsatile doxorubicin release. Following nanoparticle detachment, the unmasked bacterial surface engages with host immune cells, promoting macrophage M1 polarization and establishing a pro‑inflammatory tumor microenvironment. This immune activation acts in concert with photothermal therapy and spatiotemporally controlled chemotherapy to synergistically achieve potent photochemo-immunotherapy with minimal systemic toxicity. Overall, this work establishes a generalizable strategy to achieve adequate intratumoral drug delivery and highlights the therapeutic potential of bacteria-mediated hybrid systems.",

    "Abstract": "Ovarian aging, characterized by declining ovarian reserve, is a pacemaker of aging in the female body. Oxidative stress leads to apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and telomere shortening, accelerating ovarian aging. Scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been shown to delay ovarian aging; however, there remains a significant lack of antioxidants with both proven efficacy and minimal side effects. DNA tetrahedral nanostructure (DTN) is a promising nucleic acid framework with antioxidant and anti-apoptotic properties. We developed FSH-DTN, a modified nanoparticle equipped with a follicle-stimulating hormone receptor-targeting peptide (FSH33-53) to enhance ovarian accumulation. Compared to native DTN, FSH-DTN showed superior ovarian targeting efficiency as confirmed by in vivo imaging. In both in vivo and in vitro models of acute, subacute, and chronic ovarian aging, FSH-DTN demonstrated superior antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, and anti-aging effects. Further investigation revealed that FSH-DTN can directly eliminate ROS in the ovaries while enhancing ovarian antioxidant capacity by activating the NRF2 signaling pathway, thereby protecting ovarian function. In this study, we offer a new strategy for neutralizing oxidative stress to delay ovarian aging.",

    "Abstract": "Exosomes serve as pivotal nanoscale messengers in intercellular communication by transporting bioactive molecules such as miRNAs, proteins, and lipids that regulate physiological and pathological processes. Emerging evidence highlights exercise as a potent modulator of exosome biogenesis, dynamically altering their release kinetics, molecular cargo, and bioactivity across tissues. Exercise-derived exosomes disseminate systemic adaptations by delivering regulatory signals to noncontractile organs, thereby coordinating multitissue responses that underlie the protective and reparative benefits of physical activity. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the dynamic effects of acute and chronic exercise on exosome profiles and their therapeutic potential in treating neurological, cardiovascular, metabolic, and musculoskeletal disorders. This review further discusses how exosome engineering and precision medicine could harness exosomes as \"exercise mimetics,\" offering cell-free therapeutics for mobility-limited populations. By integrating exercise physiology with translational medicine, this work pioneers a new therapeutic paradigm where exosome-based molecular therapies replicate exercise's multisystem benefits.",

    "Abstract": "As a classic nanozyme, titanium dioxide (TiO₂) is increasingly utilized in medical fields such as anti-infection, tumor therapy, and inflammation regulation. However, their expanding application has raised concerns regarding biosafety, particularly their potential threat to maternal and fetal health. To evaluate this risk, this study established a pregnant rat model, focusing on the placenta as a potential target organ, to investigate the developmental toxicity and potential interventions associated with the use of TiO₂ nanozymes (TiO₂ NZs) as therapeutic agents during pregnancy. The results revealed that gestational intake of TiO₂ NZs led to fetal growth restriction, abnormal placental weight increase, and induced placental energy metabolism disruption along with excessive autophagy activation. Surprisingly, when attempting to reverse these toxic effects, we found that TiO₂ NZs suppressed AMPK expression, prompting Compound C and phenformin to unconventionally regulate energy imbalance-induced autophagy via non-AMPK/mTOR pathway-dependent mechanisms. This resulted in a complex scenario where the two drugs produced inverted effects-\"aggravation\" vs. \"alleviation\"-during intervention. These findings indicate that despite the significant medical value of TiO₂ as a nanozyme, they pose non-negligible safety risks, and pharmacological interventions may trigger unexpected effects. Therefore, while advancing their clinical application, it is crucial to prioritize in-depth mechanistic studies and the development of precise intervention strategies, especially ensuring the long-term health and safety for maternal and fetal populations.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction In response to the overdose epidemic, novel strategies including Overdose Response Hotlines and Applications (ORHAs) have been introduced to help mitigate the crisis. These technologies enable individuals with a phone to access harm reduction support via smartphones and applications. Such supports include overdose monitoring, access to social services, mental health referrals, and more. This study analyzed data from the Canadian National Questionnaire on Overdose Monitoring (CNQOM), a large bilingual national survey, to evaluate the perspectives of people who use unregulated substances currently (PWUS-C), people who used unregulated substances previously (PWUS-P), and addiction service provider (ASP) on the importance of specific ORHA features. Methods One component of the CNQOM pertained to the importance of specific ORHA service elements. Examined categories included accessibility and technological features, overdose response functionality, data privacy and philosophies of care, additional support services, and substance usage. Each group responded to 33 questions on a 5-point Likert scale, and the data was analyzed using descriptive statistics involving percentages and ordinal logistical regression analysis. Results The study involved 971 participants: 840 PWUS-C, 298 PWUS-P, and 169 ASP. The majority of respondents from the key groups considered all ORHA elements important. Generally, the groups ranked the elements in a similar order of importance, with only minor variations. The highest-ranked elements in each element category with regards to importance were: 24/7 availability (84% of PWUS-C, 88% of PWUS-P, and 90% of ASP), the ability of EMS to resuscitate individuals during an overdose (81% of PWUS-C, 83% of PWUS-P, 85% ASP), non-judgmental support (87% of PWUS-C, 87% of PWUS-P, and 91% of ASP), access to mental health support (82% of PWUS-C, 84% of PWUS-P, and 90% of ASP), and feeling safer when using substances (80% of PWUS-C, 81% of PWUS-P, and 88% of ASP). Conclusion This paper highlights the importance multiple groups place on various elements of ORHAs, reflecting critical elements that should be considered when standardizing these virtual harm reduction technologies. The results of this study provide insight into opportunities to enhance virtual platforms, making them more responsive, accessible, and trusted as harm reduction resources.",

    "Abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases remain refractory to immunotherapy due to a profoundly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Here, we conducted a prospective clinical study enrolling 18 patients with microsatellite-stable CRC liver metastases treated with high-dose radiotherapy (RT) followed by anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors (RT-ICI). Integrative analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and peripheral immune profiling revealed that RT-ICI therapy reprograms both tumor-intrinsic and immune compartments. RT triggered the emergence of an APOA2⁺ tumor cell state characterized by enhanced lipid metabolic activity and transient elevation of circulating HDL. This metabolic reprogramming, in turn, promoted systemic activation of CETP⁺ M2-like macrophages, a population marked by high LXR/RXR transcriptional activity and enriched expression of immunosuppressive and lipid-processing genes. Despite their expansion, CETP⁺ macrophages localized preferentially to non-irradiated tumor regions, suggesting a distal immunometabolic effect driven by HDL-mediated signaling. Concurrently, combination therapy expanded GZMB⁺ effector T cells and induced a novel population of inflammatory-toxic T cells (IT_T), which exhibited high cytotoxicity and spatial co-localization with CXCL10⁺ macrophages. Ligand-receptor analysis and pseudotime modeling revealed that irradiated tumor cells acted as \"in situ vaccines\" by enhancing MHC-TCR interactions and promoting T cell differentiation along non-exhausted cytotoxic lineages. Together, these findings reveal a dual mechanism by which RT-ICI therapy enhances local anti-tumor immunity while modulating systemic lipid metabolism and macrophage polarization, offering insights for combinatorial immunotherapy design in immunologically \"cold\" tumors.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Delayed detection of recurrence significantly contributes to colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, underscoring the need for robust prognostic biomarkers. Although extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is a known oncogenic driver, its prognostic utility in CRC remains largely unexplored. Methods In this 6-year prospective cohort study, full-length eccDNA profiling of 153 plasma samples was performed using Nanopore sequencing. Differential eccDNA signatures between recurrence (R, n = 20) and non-recurrence (NR, n = 133) patients enabled construction of predictive models for recurrence and mortality. Functional validation of eccDNAs was conducted in HCT116 cells. Results Compared to NR patients, R patients exhibited enrichment of eccDNAs derived from chromosome 9, shorter median eccDNA lengths, and reduced variability in eccDNA length. All 4.9–5.0 kb eccDNAs derived from CKM , while other eccDNAs showed a strong genomic distribution correlation between groups (Spearman’s ρ = 0.73). Promoter-derived eccDNAs were enriched in R patients, particularly from the promoter of CARD9 (eccPromoter-CARD9, 10.4-fold increase). Overexpression of eccPromoter-CARD9 significantly promoted CRC cell proliferation and migration. R patients exhibited elevated eccDNAs harboring the hsa-mir-374c cluster in plasma and tissues, and their corresponding miRNAs demonstrated exceptional diagnostic accuracy in CRC-related TCGA cohorts. An eccDNA-based random forest classifier achieved superior recurrence prediction accuracy (AUC &gt; 0.8), correlating with shorter time-to-recurrence (HR = 3.79) and elevated CA125 and CEA levels. Additional eccDNA-based models effectively predicted recurrence-associated mortality (AUC ≥ 0.93). Conclusions The plasma eccDNA landscape may serve as an early and powerful non-invasive biomarker for CRC prognostication, optimizing risk stratification and guiding personalized treatment.",

Methods Longitudinal analysis of data from a randomized trial carried out in a health promotion service, including individuals with positive changes in FV intake after intervention. FV intake was assessed at 48 months, compared to 12 months to identify whether maintenance was associated with demographics, health data, stages of change, self-efficacy, and decisional balance, using multivariate regression. Results We included 2,232 participants, 88.4% were women, 46.6% were maintainers at 48 months. Maintainers were older, had lower schooling and baseline FV intake, had been in the service for longer, and increased FV intake between 12 and 48 months while non-maintainers decreased it. Being older or in the service for 36 + months were associated with 1% and 30% higher odds of maintenance; higher baseline FV intake and self-efficacy were associated with 1% and 2% lower odds of maintenance.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Gene therapy (GT) using retroviral vectors (RVs) is efficacious in treating monogenic diseases. However, there is an inherent risk for severe adverse effects due to insertional mutagenesis. Preclinical safety assessment and patient monitoring are inevitable in GT. To assess the genotoxic risk of novel RV vectors, mainly murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs) are routinely used, because human HSPCs cannot be immortalized in vitro using mutagenic vectors. In this study, we aim to identify early signs of clonal outgrowth by performing integration site analyses (ISA). Methods The small molecules A 83-01, p omalidomide, and U M171 (APU) were used for the ex vivo expansion, lentiviral transduction, and long-term cultivation of umbilical cord blood-derived HSPCs. We determined the influence of APU on the stemness of HSPCs and their differentiation capacity via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) and in xenotransplantation studies. To track vector insertion site dynamics, we transduced 7-day expanded HSPCs with a mutagenic or a safer RV. ISA was conducted in human HSPCs over a 5-week cultivation in vitro and compared to the bone marrow of xenotransplanted mice to assess clonal skewings. Results APU supported the expansion of CD34 + CD38 − CD45RA − CD90 + EPCR + HSPCs. scRNA seq confirmed the enrichment of HSC signature genes in APU-expanded HSPCs compared to the clinically used medium SFT3 (SCF, FLT3-L, TPO, IL-3). After RV transduction, APU still maintained around 30% of CD34 + cells for 5 more weeks. Without the compounds, already 2 weeks post-transduction, less than 10% of cells were CD34 + . The long-term culture allowed the detection of high-risk integrations of the mutagenic SIN-LV.SF in MEIS1 or SUSD6 due to their increasing abundance over time. Bone marrow of xenotransplanted mice was less clonal but did not support the outgrowth of insertional mutants. Overall, APU increased clonal diversity. Conclusions Our findings propose that long-term cultivation of transduced HSPC in APU allows for outgrowth of clonal integration sites. The decrease of clonality has been observed in gene therapy patient’s years after treatment. Thus, the in vitro model could be used to develop novel human HSPC-based genotoxicity assays that predict insertional mutagenesis, in addition to existing preclinical biosafety assays.",

    "Abstract": "The current classification of extant Zoraptera is based on the results of molecular phylogeny combined with the morphology of male genitalia and supplemented by the characters on the male abdomen and the number of metatibial spurs. However, fossil representatives of Zoraptera have not yet been classified into the modern system, and most of them remain in the catch-all genus Zorotypus Silvestri, 1913, because the genitalia are either not observable or have not been examined in detail. In this study, for the first time, we describe and critically evaluate the male genitalia and other principal diagnostic characters of all available Mesozoic Zoraptera. Our results have led to the first proposal of a generic classification of Mesozoic Zoraptera. We describe two new genera, Cretozoros gen. nov. and Burmazoros gen. nov., reinstate Paleospinosus Kaddumi, 2005, stat. restit. from synonymy with the subgenus Octozoros Engel, 2003 (in Zorotypus), and elevate Octozoros Engel, 2003 to the genus level. Cretozoros gen. nov., Paleospinosus Kaddumi, 2005, stat. restit., and Octozoros stat. nov. are classified in Spiralizoridae: Latinozorinae, whereas Burmazoros gen. nov. and Xenozorotypus Engel & Grimaldi, 2002 are classified in Zorotypidae: Zorotypinae. Altogether, it was possible to classify nine of the 11 currently recognized species of Mesozoic Zoraptera. To evaluate the phylogenetic relationships of fossil zorapterans, including the newly established taxa, we estimated the evolutionary histories of selected morphological features using ancestral character state reconstruction. The classification of Mesozoic Zoraptera within the modern system enables us to better understand the early evolution of this insect order.",

    "Abstract": "Rubus species, including raspberry and blackberry, are affected by over 40 known viruses that can impact fruit yield, plant vigor, and germplasm movement. These species differ markedly in their response to viral infection, yet the factors that contribute to susceptibility are unknown. We hypothesize this is due to differences in virus accumulation dynamics. We utilized an infectious clone of blackberry chlorotic ringspot virus to assess replication efficiency in 'Munger' black raspberry (Rubus occidentalis, L.), a virus indicator for Rubus viruses, and 'Natchez' blackberry (Rubus L. subgenus Rubus Watson), a cultivar that typically is asymptomatic to single virus infections. This study demonstrated that virus accumulation in 'Munger' is over 4.4 × 10<sup>5</sup>-fold higher than in 'Natchez,' based on a model-derived estimate averaged across sampling time points, providing evidence that the host genotype plays a key role in supporting virus replication. These findings deepen our understanding of virus-host interactions and further validate the use of 'Munger' as a virus indicator for Rubus.",

    "Abstract": "Rotaviruses A (RVA) are the most common cause of diarrhea-related death in children under the age of five. Because RV vaccines are live attenuated, their use is limited. This work aimed to develop a multi-epitope vaccination against RVA using reverse vaccinology approaches. The viral protein 6 (VP6) was targeted for predicting B-cell and T-cell epitopes, and the best epitopes from its conserved regions were linked by appropriate linkers; additionally, 50 S ribosomal protein L7/L12 was inserted as an adjuvant to the vaccine's N-terminus. The designed vaccine revealed satisfactory antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, and physicochemical characteristics. The molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation showed strong binding interactions between the vaccine and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), signifying improved antigen presentation efficacy. The vaccine immunity simulation showed a significant rise in immunoglobulins and cytokines. Furthermore, the vaccine candidate showed a high likelihood of successful expression in Escherichia coli (E. coli). Our findings suggest that the multi-epitope vaccine candidate exhibits significant potential; however, experimental evaluations are necessary to determine its ability to stimulate the immune system.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Carbon based fibers are considered to exhibit a carcinogenic potency when inhaled into the deep lung. Mesotheliomas develop after intraperitoneal application of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) exceeding a diameter of about 37 nm, whereas carcinogenic potency decreases for diameters below this threshold. While large MWCNT diameters are associated with a rigid fiber geometry, this study examined the effects of MWCNTs with smaller diameters ranging from 10 to 30 nm. Also, a sample of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibiting single fiber diameters significantly below 10 nm and showing a flexible geometry was included since individual SWCNT fibers can aggregate to form bundles that exhibit increased rigidity. Additionally, the carcinogenic effect of pitch-based carbon fiber fragments was investigated. Carbon fibers are industrially produced with diameters larger than 4 µm and are thus not per se respirable. However, pitch-based fibers tend to break along their longitudinal axis, resulting in respirable fragments, partially of critical WHO dimensions. Four CNT samples with a geometric mean diameter (GMD) of 30 nm, 20 nm, 10 nm, and smaller than 10 nm, as well as one fragmented carbon fiber sample (GMD 1.3 µm) were intraperitoneally injected into rats in two dosages (0.1 × 10 9 and 1 × 10 9 WHO fibers or WHO-analog nanofibers) and observed for up to 24 months. A long amosite asbestos (GMD 0.37 µm) with known fiber-specific carcinogenic effect served as a positive control (0.1 × 10 9 WHO fibers). Results A small number of mesotheliomas occurred in all fiber types, but not at all dosages. For the carbon fiber material, a possible weak carcinogenic potency is seen at the higher dosage. For the SWCNT fiber, low number of mesotheliomas likewise suggest a weak carcinogenic potency. In the case of the MWCNT fiber with a GMD of 30 nm, very low number of mesotheliomas indicate a possible very weak carcinogenic potency. No clear carcinogenic potency was observed for the MWCNTs with GMDs of 20 nm and 10 nm. Conclusions Carbon fiber fragments and thin but bundled MWCNTs showed weak carcinogenic potency. Non-bundled MWCNTs with a diameter below 30 nm did not show clearcarcinogenic potency at a dose up to 1 × 10 9 WHO-analog nanofibers.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background As a pluricultural country, Mexico must promote breastfeeding through intercultural approaches. Although existing research remains limited, the exclusion and precarious living conditions experienced by many Indigenous communities render such efforts both challenging and essential for reducing inequalities in breastfeeding support. Moreover, while low breastfeeding rates at both global and local levels have been extensively documented through quantitative studies, the lived experiences of Indigenous mothers remain highly variable and underexplored. To date, qualitative research centered on Indigenous breastfeeding mothers’ perspectives is scarce. This paper presents a case study of breastfeeding practices within a Tzeltal Indigenous community, examining the embodied, co-participatory, and situated dimensions of maternal care. Methods Using qualitative methods and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis within the ‘Operational Research Group and Participatory Inquiry´ framework. A total of 19 Tzeltal-speaking mothers who were breastfeeding their children participated in the study, conducted on November 12, 2024, in the Tzeltal community of San Juan Cancuc, Chiapas. Data were collected through group sessions documented with field notes and audio recordings. The material was analyzed using conventional content analysis with emergent coding, grounding interpretations in participants’ lived, embodied, affective, communal, and contextual breastfeeding experiences, allowing categories to be inductively generated from participants’ narratives. Results The findings highlight that breastfeeding practices within a Tzeltal Indigenous community are not merely an individual act but a deeply relational, embodied and communitarian experience shaped by sociocultural, cosmogonic and spatial-contextual factors. Conclusions This qualitative study, grounded in an intercultural perspective and centered on Indigenous mothers’ breastfeeding experiences, advocates for a more nuanced, interculturally oriented approach to breastfeeding promotion, protection, and support -one that recognizes the affective, embodied, and collective dimensions of maternal care. By attending to local beliefs, cosmogonies, and shared practices surrounding traditional breastfeeding, the study offers crucial insights that contribute to advancing reproductive justice for women, infants, and their communities, while underscoring the importance of intercultural strategies in the design and implementation of breastfeeding policies in a pluricultural country such as Mexico.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block has proven to be an effective strategy for postoperative pain management in total hip arthroplasty (THA). However, its implementation requires specialized equipment and expertise, which limits its reproducibility. The objective of this study was to describe the technique of direct visualization-guided PENG block (PENG-DV) and assess its outcomes for postoperative pain control. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted in patients who underwent THA through a direct anterior approach (DAA) and received the PENG-DV block as part of a standardized multimodal analgesia protocol. Demographic variables, pain score on the visual analogue scale (VAS), opioid consumption, muscle strength, and ambulation within the first 24 h were evaluated. Results Of the 128 patients identified, 112 were included in the analysis. The cohort was predominantly female (60.7%), with a mean age of 63 years. The median postoperative VAS score was 2 and 3 at 12 and 24 h respectively, increasing to 5 during physical therapy. By postoperative day one, 83.9% of patients ambulated, and most achieved muscle strength ≥ 3 for both hip flexion and knee extension. A total of 54.5% of patients required opioid rescue, with a mean morphine equivalent consumption of 10 mg within the first 24 h. Conclusion PENG-DV for THA via DAA appears to be a promising strategy for effective pain control in the immediate postoperative period, as part of a multimodal analgesic approach designed to reduce opioid consumption and promote early mobilization.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract As a core metric for climate policy, the scientific estimation of carbon social costs is crucial for formulating mitigation strategies. However, traditional integrated assessment models predominantly focus on the global aggregate, failing to adequately account for regional heterogeneity, sectoral characteristics, and strategic interactions between regions. They also lack systematic integration of ESG principles. To address this, this paper examines regional and sectoral carbon social costs driven by ESG development. Through cooperative and non-cooperative games, we improve the integrated economic-environmental-climate development model, take the eight economic regions in China as an example, get the carbon social cost of each economic region and typical important industries, and obtain the key parameters and the evolution law of carbon social cost. The model categorizes the carbon emissions after the implementation of emission reduction policies under the ESG perspective into direct and indirect emissions. It studies the economic impacts of the two types of emissions before and after the implementation of emission reduction policies, and conducts research on the top four typical important industries (industry, construction, transportation, and power) that rank among the top four global CO 2 emitters, to obtain the analytical solution of the social cost of carbon in the region and the typical important industries. In addition, this paper numerically simulates the social cost of carbon for the four industries under the baseline scenario, cooperative game scenario, non-cooperative game scenario, and temperature limitation scenario. The study shows that the social cost of carbon in the northern, southern and eastern coastal economic regions is higher than that in other economic regions, the social cost of carbon in the industrial and electric power industries in each economic region is higher than that in the building and transportation industries, and the more stringent the temperature limit is, the higher the social cost of carbon is in the economic regions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract As a far-reaching initiative in China’s air pollution control and energy transition efforts, the clean heating policy has sparked considerable debate in both academia and practice regarding its effectiveness in reducing carbon emissions. This study uses panel data from 15 prefecture-level cities in northern China from 2013 to 2023 and constructs a multi-period difference-in-differences model to empirically examine the impact of the clean heating policy on regional carbon emissions. The results are summarized as follows: (1) The policy effectively promotes the reduction of regional unit GDP and per capita carbon emission intensity in Northern China, but it has no evident effect on regional total carbon emissions. (2) The policy can exert the multiplier effect of the central government funds and structural effect to facilitate regional low-carbon transformation, but no significant Porter effect has been observed. (3) The carbon reduction effects exhibit significant regional heterogeneity. The policy has a more significant effect on carbon emissions of nonprovincial capital cities, coal-resource cities, and regions without coal power output, but it may significantly increase emissions in coal power-exporting regions. The clean heating policy should continue to be vigorously implemented, but its implementation strategy should be optimized by strengthening the transmission mechanism and addressing regional differences.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Psychological distress and chronic stress were suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology of idiopathic pain conditions such as provoked vulvodynia (PV). The comorbidity of PV and mood disorder is quite common. Thus, vulvar pain can trigger anxiety, and mood disruption, whereas elevated anxiety and mood disruption play a critical role in pain maintenance. Yet, whether chronic stress can facilitate the development of chronic vulvar pain remains unclear. Here, we aimed to assess the effects of chronic stress on anxiety, depression-like behaviors, and the development of chronic vulvar pain after vulvar inflammation, which combines acute inflammation with chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in female rats. Current result indicates that CUS leads to a reduction in vulvar mechanical thresholds and an increase in anxiety-like behavior, including reduced entries and time spent in the open arms of the EPM, reduced time in the center, increased distance moved in the OF, and reduced sucrose intake compared to the non-CUS group. Blood corticosterone levels and gene expression related to neuronal activation (cFOS) and GABA-synthesis (GAD67) were significantly increased in the amygdala and PAG in the CUS group compared to the non-CUS group. Following vulvar injection (saline/zymosan), there was a significant reduction in vulvar mechanical threshold in all groups: non-CUS/Saline, non-CUS/Zymosan, CUS/Saline, and CUS/Zymosan. However, mechanical thresholds returned to baseline in all groups except the CUS/Zymosan group, which exhibited prolonged vulvar hypersensitivity with no sign of recovery. Long-term behavioral assessments revealed reduced open-arm entries, altered locomotion, and decreased sucrose intake of the CUS groups compared to non-CUS groups. In conclusion, chronic stress enhances vulnerability to chronic vulvar pain following acute inflammation, alongside persistent anxiety and depression-like behaviors. These findings support a biopsychosocial model of PV, emphasizing the interplay between stress and inflammation in vulvar pain chronification.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Genetic variants that are associated with phenotypic variability, or variance quantitative trait loci (vQTLs), have been detected for multiple human traits. Gene-environment interactions can lead to differential phenotypic variability across genotype groups, therefore, genetic variants that interact with environmental exposures can manifest as vQTLs. Although changes in DNA methylation variability have been observed in several diseases, vQTLs for methylation levels (vmeQTL) have not yet been explored in depth. Results We optimize the value of monozygotic twin studies to identify and replicate vmeQTLs for blood DNA methylation variance at 358 CpGs in 988 adult monozygotic twin pairs from two European twin registries. Over a third of vmeQTLs capture identical vmeQTL-environmental factor interactions in both datasets, and the majority of interactions are observed with blood cell counts. Correspondingly, over 60% of CpGs affected by genotype-monocyte and genotype-T cell interactions replicate as CpGs affected by genetic effects in the relevant cell type in an independent dataset. Most vmeQTLs also replicate in 1,348 UK non-twin adults and show longitudinal stability in a sample subset. Integrating gene expression and phenotype association results identifies multiple vmeQTLs that capture GxE effects relevant to human health. Examples include vmeQTLs interacting with blood cell type to influence DNA methylation in FAM65A, NAPRT, and CSGALNACT1 underlying immune disease susceptibility and progression. Conclusions Our findings identify novel genetic effects on human DNA methylation variability within a unique monozygotic twin study design. The results show the potential of vmeQTLs to identify gene-environment interactions and provide novel insights into complex traits.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The complex historical phenomenon known as Greek colonization refers to the strategic establishment of new settlements (colonies) from the 8th to the early fourth century BCE. Unlike earlier migrations, this process was planned and driven by the need to expand trade, access resources, and develop economic as well as political networks. Corinth, a prominent commercial center in southern Greece, constitutes a prominent example for initiating colonization. By founding colonies, Corinth established a safe and continuous route for moving goods along the coasts of western mainland Greece and the Adriatic. Amvrakia was one of Corinth’s principal colonies along this route in northwestern Greece. Founded in the seventh century BCE, Amvrakia was characterized by a strong dependence on its metropolis (Corinth). Here, we aim to investigate the genetic relationships between the Corinthian metropolis and the Amvrakia colony, the contribution of the local population to the founding genetic pool, as well as the demography of Amvrakia in subsequent periods. Results During its foundation in the Archaic period, Amvrakia appears to have been shaped by genetic influences from a single source. This source migrated from the Corinth territory, represented by the Archaic Tenea population and is supported via an Identity By Descent (IBD) analysis. A direct ancestry from Late Bronze Age (LBA) Greece, including a local LBA population represented by the Ammotopos site located in close proximity to Amvrakia, was not inferred despite conducting a plethora of independent population genomics analyses. During the subsequent Classical and Hellenistic periods, the population of Amvrakia appears to have only slightly differentiated and evidence of genetic continuity over time is observed. Conclusions The migration of Corinthians to Amvrakia was the major contributor to the initial genetic pool of the colony, indicating that the Corinthian colonization included both genetic and cultural transmission between the metropolis and its colony.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The role of transposable elements (TEs) in host adaptation has gained interest in recent years. Individuals of the same species undergo independent TE insertions, providing genetic variability within populations, upon which natural selection can act to foster adaptation to environmental conditions. Results As de novo assembled genomes are becoming increasingly affordable, helping to overcome the bias introduced by relying on a single reference genome, there is a growing need for suitable pangenomic tools to explore the genomic diversity within a species. We developed a new pipeline called panREPET that identifies TE insertions shared by groups of individuals. Unlike other pangenomic tools, panREPET operates independently of a reference genome and provides the precise sequence and genomic coordinates of each TE copy for each genome. Conclusions We showcase the potential of this tool by identifying TE insertions shared among 42 Brachypodium distachyo n genomes and by comparing our results with those of existing tools to demonstrate its advantages. Using panREPET, we were able to date two major TE bursts corresponding to major climate events: 22 kya during the Last Glacial Maximum and 10 kya during the Holocene, showing a potential link between environmental stress and TE activity.",

    "Abstract": "A wide range of factors has detrimental impacts upon equity, diversity, and inclusion in clinical trials, amongst which participant burden can be significant. In addition to the potential physical burdens associated with investigational interventions, participants may face onerous demands related to factors like travel, time commitments, psychological, or logistical challenges. Many of these factors have been shown to create barriers that disproportionately affect certain groups like minoritised ethnic groups, people with caring responsibilities, and older adults. One increasingly problematic aspect of participant burden is associated with an excessive volume of data collection, much of which may lack direct relevance to the study's primary objectives and may never be analysed. Although pragmatic and participant-centred trial methodologies have risen in prominence over the past decade, quantitative evidence demonstrates that trial complexity and data volumes are continuing to rise. The widening gap between the notion of participant-centricity and the realities of current trial practice underscores the need for a shift in approach. Reducing unnecessary burden should be regarded as a moral obligation across all clinical trial designs to avoid the systematic exclusion of certain groups. With a focus on data-related aspects, this paper examines the ethical implications of undue burdens upon participants and proposes measures to help minimise and mitigate these burdens. In addressing this issue, researchers contribute to broader efforts to enhance inclusivity and representation in clinical studies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background For decades, insecticides have been central to controlling the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti (L.), but extensive use has driven resistance development. This study investigates resistance of Ae. aegypti to pyrethroids (permethrin, deltamethrin) and organophosphates (malathion, pirimiphos-methyl) and their underlying mechanisms across Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and the USA. Methods Adult female Ae. aegypti (3–5 days old, non-blood-fed) were subjected to World Health Organization (WHO) tube bioassays using 0.4% permethrin, 0.03% deltamethrin, 5% malathion, and 60 mg/m 2 pirimiphos-methyl. Each assay included four replicates of 25 mosquitoes, with mortality assessed at 24 h post-exposure. Genomic DNA was extracted from 10 resistant individuals per population, and two coding regions of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene (domains II and III) were amplified and sequenced to detect known and novel kdr mutations. For biochemical analysis, 40 newly emerged, non-blood-fed females per strain were individually homogenized to quantify mixed-function oxidase (MFO), esterase (α- and β-EST), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Results High resistance levels were recorded in Malaysian and US Ae. aegypti strains, with low mortality ranging between 9% and 22% for pyrethroids. New mutations T1520I (8–15%) and I1011M (10–15%) were identified in Malaysian populations, the first detection of T1520I in the country, while V1016I (10%) was newly detected in Indonesian strains. Malaysian mosquitoes had multiple kdr mutations (S989P, V1016G, F1534C, and T1520I) in triple- and quadruple-haplotype combinations. The US Riverside strain showed a nine- to 10-fold increase in β-EST and three- to fivefold increase in MFO and GST activity compared to the VCRU susceptible strain, indicating strong metabolic resistance. In contrast, the highly resistant Malaysian Hamna strain exhibited no significant upregulation ( P &gt; 0.05) in detoxifying enzymes, suggesting resistance was driven primarily by kdr mutations. Thai strains lacked kdr mutations but exhibited altered AChE (20–35% remaining activity) and elevated GST (2–3 times higher than control). Conclusions The detection of novel kdr mutations and diverse resistance mechanisms underscores the adaptability of Ae. aegypti to insecticide pressure and highlights the urgent need for continuous monitoring and integrated resistance management strategies.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are widely recognized for their immunomodulatory properties, which underpin their therapeutic potential in inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases. Although MSC therapies have consistently proven safe, clinical efficacy remains inconclusive, maybe due to incomplete understanding of MSC interactions with the immune environment. This review evaluates current trends in MSC immunomodulation research, based on 318 studies published since 2019 until medio 2024. The most frequently used assays included characterization, proliferation, and polarization, employing methods such as flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and colorimetric assays, and polymerase chain reaction. Many studies incorporated strategies for priming of MSCs or included immune cells, most commonly peripheral blood mononuclear cells, T cells, and macrophages. We identify key sources of variability and propose a minimum reporting checklist including MSC source, priming conditions, assay design, and immune cell characteristics. We further recommend implementation of multi-assay workflows combining phenotypic characterization with at least one functional assay. These measures may improve transparency, comparability across studies, and guide robust assay design. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), a systemic autoimmune disorder of unknown etiology, disproportionately affects females at a 3:1 ratio compared to males. While biological sex differences in the immune system exist, sex-related differences in inflammatory and immune mediators of RA disease severity are undefined. Our objective was to characterize sex-related differences in immune responses in a murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model and in human RA patients. Methods In CIA compared to saline control mice, inflammatory disease severity was assessed using standardized clinical scores. Anti-collagen antibodies, neutrophil elastase, calprotectin/ S100A8/A9 heterodimer, CRAMP, MMP3, and MMP9 were quantified by ELISA in the sera and joint tissues. Cytokine/chemokine levels in sera and joints were assessed using a Luminex based-44-Plex Discovery Assay ® Array. Immunophenotyping of mouse splenic T cells analysis was performed by flow cytometry. Proteomic profiling of serum samples from an established RA cohort (72 female and 19 male that were at least 84% ACPA+) was performed using an aptamer-based SomaScan platform. Results We identified distinct sex-related differences in disease severity and pro-inflammatory profiles in the sera and joint tissues of CIA mice, with inflammatory responses that were male-skewed in the sera and female-skewed in the joints. Furthermore, we demonstrated heightened neutrophil activation markers and CD4 + T cell-mediated inflammatory responses in female CIA mice. Similar sex-related differences in neutrophil activation and leucocyte migration were identified in RA patients. Conclusions Our study demonstrates novel sex differences in pro-inflammatory mediators and activities of neutrophils and CD4 + T cells associated with disease severity in CIA mice, and in human RA patients. These findings provide new insights into sex-related differences in immunological pathways associated with inflammatory arthritis, which may contribute to the sex disparity in RA pathogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Numerous sex differences has been described in aterosclerosis including in endothelial dysfunction. Oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) contribute to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque by binding to a membrane glycoprotein expressed by endothelial cells. Ox-LDL also play a key role in mediating endothelial dysfunction during pregnancy. Elevated maternal ox-LDL levels can lead to oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in placental and fetal endothelial cells. The aim of this study was to investigate sex-related differences in the response to ox-LDL-induced damage in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) isolated from male and female newborns. Methods In our study, the effects of 100 µg/ml ox-LDL on HUVECs, obtained from umbilical cords of healthy newborns of both sexes, were analyzed. By flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and Western blotting techniques, mitochondrial function, cell survival, and autophagy were studied. Results Sex differences in cell motility and fate have been detected after ox-LDL treatment. Indeed, following ox-LDL treatment, male HUVECs (MHUVECs ) exhibited reduced motility and a significant increase in adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, in contrast to female HUVECs (FHUVECs). Furthermore, MHUVECs exhibited higher levels of fission proteins (DRP1 and Fis1), superoxide anion (O₂⁻), and earlier mitochondrial membrane (MM) hyperpolarization, while FHUVECs showed higher levels of fusion proteins (OPA1 and MFN2), hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), and delayed MM changes. These findings were consistent with a greater propensity for apoptosis in MHUVECs. In contrast, FHUVECs exhibited higher levels of Survivin, making them less susceptible to apoptosis and more susceptible to the autophagy process. Conclusions Our findings reveal significant sex-related variations in endothelial responses to oxidative stress. The enhanced survival and repair capacity of FHUVECs suggests that female cells are more resilient to ox-LDL-induced damage.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Integrating HIV clinical records with population-based surveillance data allows the study of health care seeking behaviours, access to care, and predictors of patient outcomes. We implemented a graph-based record linkage algorithm to deduplicate and link HIV clinical and population-based surveillance records in an HIV-endemic setting in rural South Africa. Methods We linked four data sources to create the Africa Health Research Institute (AHRI) Unified Data Platform: AHRI’s Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), AHRI Clinic and Hospital Information System (AHRILink), National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), and Three Integrated Electronic Registers (TIER.Net) HIV care and treatment records. HDSS data were collected between January 1, 2000, and July 31, 2024, through repeated household surveys of over 140,000 individuals. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained for one hospital and 17 clinics in Hlabisa, KwaZulu-Natal, covering the HDSS surveillance area. We implemented a probabilistic record linkage algorithm trained and validated on a subset of records with national identity numbers. We assessed linkage accuracy, computed descriptive statistics for the linked database, and estimated the HIV care cascade for this population. Results A total of 986,832 records were successfully linked across the four databases, achieving a sensitivity of 92.7% and a positive predictive value of 96.5% (F-score=0.95). The average number of records (standard deviation (SD)) in TIER.Net, HDSS, AHRILink and NHLS were 1.18 (0.44),1.05 (0.23),1.13 (0.40), and 5.21 (4.24), respectively. The linked data indicated that 12,293 HDSS resident adults (≥15 years) were living with HIV at some point during the 2022 and 2024 surveillance rounds. Of these, 10,622 (86.4%) had ever sought HIV care in the public sector, of whom 10,492 (98.8%) had ever started ART and 7,065 (66.5%) were currently on ART, of whom 6,301 (89.2%) were virally suppressed(viral load&lt;200 copies/mL). Conclusion HIV care and population surveillance records from four data sources were deduplicated and linked with high accuracy, revealing persistent gaps in retention in care and viral suppression in an HIV-endemic region in rural South Africa. The AHRI Unified Data Platform offers the potential to deepen our understanding of HIV epidemiology in a well-described population and to improve services for HIV.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Numerous risk factors were identified for the incidence of renal injury and fibrosis among which is environmental pollution whereas air pollution by diesel particulate matter (PM) represents one of the most serious factors especially in developing countries. The present study aimed to explore the potential renoprotective effects of fisetin; a natural flavonoid against diesel PM-induced renal injury and fibrosis and clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms. For this purpose, adult Wistar albino rats received diesel PM (0.064 mg/kg/via oral gavage, three times/week) and were co-treated with fisetin (2.5 mg/Kg/via oral gavage/ day) for six weeks and compared with age-matched normal control group (NC). Kidney functions were assessed in serum samples while kidneys were harvested for biochemical and histological examination. Compared to NC group, diesel PM-administrated rats displayed elevated level of lipocalin-2 (Lcn-2) and kidney dysfunction along with renal histological changes that were alleviated markedly by fisetin. Concurrent treatment with fisetin significantly lowered the renal levels of NF-κB, IL-23 in addition to other inflammatory mediators including IL-17, TNF-α and IL-6. Also, diesel PM-administrated rats co-treated with fisetin showed downregulation of mTOR/S6K-b1 signaling besides a significant decrease in the renal expression of caveolin-1. This was associated with marked attenuation of interstitial fibrosis in the renal tissues of diesel PM-administrated rats. In conclusion, these findings proved for the first time that fisetin could exert renoprotective effects against renal injury and fibrosis induced by diesel PM probably via downregulation of IL-23/mTOR/S6K-b1 signaling along with decreasing renal caveolin-1 expression.",

    "Abstract": "ESCC is highly aggressive. The patients with advanced disease have a poor prognosis, making it the main type of EC in China. Glycolytic metabolic reprogramming supports the occurrence, malignant progression, and drug resistance of ESCC. This may lead to late cancer detection and treatment difficulties. However, the specific mechanisms driving this phenomenon remain a mystery. In this study, we found that VPS4A had high expression in ESCC tissues. It was an independent factor affecting patient prognosis. In vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that VPS4A activated glycolysis in ESCC to promote tumor malignant progression and radioresistance. Mechanistically, VPS4A upregulated MYO1C expression to enhance glycolytic metabolism in ESCC cells, increasing glucose uptake and lactate production, thereby enhancing the radioresistance of tumor. Moreover, lactate produced by glycolysis could also enhance the VPS4A and MYO1C expression. Overall, our study indicated that VPS4A is a valuable therapeutic target for ESCC, highlighting the significance of the VPS4A/MYO1C/glycolysis axis in ESCC progression.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background β-Carotene exhibits distinct biological effects that enhance reproductive performance in mammals; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of β-carotene on ovarian development in replacement gilts and to investigate its potential mechanisms. Results A total of 20 gilts, aged 130 d, were randomly assigned to control group or β-carotene group (β-C group, diet containing 10 mg/kg of β-carotene). Each group consisted of 10 replicates, with one gilt per replicate, over a 60-d trial. β-Carotene significantly increased the number of follicles measuring 2–5 mm in diameter, elevated estradiol concentrations in both blood and follicular fluid of replacement gilts ( P &lt; 0.05). Compared to the control group, the β-C group exhibited a significant increase in β-carotene concentration within ovarian follicular fluid ( P &lt; 0.05). Transcriptomic analysis of GCs revealed that β-carotene could significantly upregulated the expression of Forkhead Box L2 (FOXL2). When β-carotene and its metabolic product were administered to granulosa cells (GCs), validation of differentially expressed genes in the transcriptome suggests the possibility that β-carotene, rather than its metabolic product, is responsible for the upregulation of FOXL2 in ovarian GCs, which subsequently may regulate StAR and enhance estradiol synthesis. Furthermore, β-carotene is likely to promote lipolysis, providing essential substrates for estradiol and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Concurrently, β-carotene appears to increase the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) in gilts, thereby reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) ( P &lt; 0.05) and maintaining redox balance. Conclusions Our findings suggest that β-carotene could promote lipolysis, activate the FOXL2-StAR pathway to increase estradiol synthesis in GCs, and alleviate oxidative stress, thereby contributing to follicle development.",

    "Abstract": "Despite the clinical success of T cell-based immunotherapies such as CAR-T cells and bispecific T cell engagers (BiTEs), therapeutic resistance and immune suppression remain significant barriers in B-cell malignancies. To address these, we developed a novel dual-functional extracellular vesicle (EV) platform, termed BiTE EV@STA, that displays anti-CD3/CD19 BiTE molecules on the EV surface while encapsulating a STING agonist (STA). This strategy enables simultaneous redirection of cytotoxic T cells to tumor cells and stimulation of innate immunity within the tumor microenvironment (TME). BiTE EVs demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics, enhanced tumor targeting, and robust T cell dependent cytotoxicity and cytokine release. In Nalm6-Luc xenograft models, BiTE EVs significantly inhibited tumor progression and prolonged survival. Further loading of STING agonists into EVs (BiTE EV@STA) activated dendritic cells, and enhanced CD8⁺ T cell infiltration in the TME. Notably, BiTE EV@STA achieved a 4-fold increase in tumor growth inhibition and a marked survival benefit compared to either component alone. This study presents BiTE EV@STA as a promising EV-based immunotherapy that integrates adaptive and innate immune activation to overcome TME-mediated resistance. These findings may have broad implications for enhancing T cell-based therapies in hematologic malignancies and beyond.",

    "Abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains among the deadliest cancers, with limited surgical eligibility, modest chemotherapy benefit, and resistance to immune checkpoint blockade. Two recent vaccine platforms have shown encouraging results. Wainberg et al. demonstrated that the amphiphile vaccine ELI-002 efficiently traffics to lymph nodes via albumin binding and induced KRAS-specific T-cell responses in most patients, correlating with survival. In parallel, Sethna et al. reported that an individualized uridine-modified mRNA vaccine elicited durable, polyfunctional CD8⁺ T cells with long-term persistence, especially when combined with PD-1 blockade. Amphiphiles provide rapid and efficient priming, whereas mRNA vaccines broaden and sustain clonotypic diversity. A hybrid prime-boost strategy may synergize these complementary mechanisms, while advances in multi-omics and AI-driven neoantigen prediction pave the way for personalized designs. Together, these developments suggest that PDAC, long regarded as immunologically \"cold,\" may become tractable to vaccination strategies. Importantly, these findings are based on early-phase clinical studies with limited patient numbers and should therefore be interpreted as preliminary clinical evidence requiring further studies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a prevalent neurodevelopmental condition in childhood, associated not only with difficulties in attention and impulsivity but also with increased internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety and depression, and a marked reduction in quality of life. Although pharmacological treatments play a central role in the management of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, there is a growing need for psychosocial interventions that target these emotional difficulties and quality of life outcomes while actively involving families. This study is novel in its evaluation of the effectiveness of a structured cognitive behavioral therapy based psychoeducational program involving both children and their parents in reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms and improving quality of life in children diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Method A quasi-experimental controlled pretest–posttest design was employed. The intervention group comprised thirty-seven children aged eight to twelve years diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and their parents, while the control group included thirty-six age- and gender-matched children with the same diagnosis and their parents. The intervention consisted of an eight-session cognitive behavioral therapy based psychoeducational program integrating emotional regulation, adaptive coping strategies, and parent-focused guidance. Data were collected at baseline and after the intervention using a sociodemographic information form, the Quality of Life Inventory, and the Revised Children’s Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results The intervention and control groups were similar in terms of demographic characteristics. The mean age of children in the intervention group was 10.35 ± 1.40 years, while the mean age of children in the control group was 10.47 ± 1.28 years ( p = 0.751). Regarding gender distribution, the intervention group consisted of 11 girls (29.7%) and 26 boys (70.3%), while the control group consisted of 18 girls (50.0%) and 18 boys (50.0%) ( p = 0.077). Children participating in the cognitive behavioral therapy -based psycho-educational program showed a statistically significant improvement in quality of life and a significant decrease in anxiety and depressive symptoms between the pre-test and post-test. No significant changes were observed in the same outcome measures in the control group. Conclusion These findings provide robust evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy based psychoeducational interventions incorporating family participation are effective in improving psychological well-being and quality of life in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. From both psychiatric and nursing perspectives, such programs represent a valuable, non-pharmacological adjunct to standard care, supporting holistic and family-centered approaches in the multidisciplinary management of childhood attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

    "Abstract": "Abstract The interplay between geothermal technologies, risk perception, social acceptability and acceptance is critical in the context of geothermal energy projects. Induced seismicity is of particular concern to citizens, and the perception of seismic risk plays an important role in the acceptability of geothermal projects. Starting point for our considerations is the DeepStor research infrastructure project and observations made within this research environment. We establish a conceptual framework for participatory monitoring of seismicity in geothermal projects and explore its possible influence on socio-psychological factors related to risk perception and technology acceptability and acceptance. The participatory monitoring is based on a citizen science approach in which citizens are invited to actively participate in seismic measurements around a geothermal project using plug-and-play seismometers. The potential individual, societal and scientific implications of this approach are analyzed by introducing established participatory and social scientific concepts within the geothermal context. Our conceptual analysis suggests that participatory monitoring could effectively address seismic risk perception and acceptability by enhancing transparency, providing non-experts with first-hand experiences, and fostering discussions and informed decision-making. From a technical perspective, implementing this approach to create dense seismic networks enhances the evidence base in research projects and supports more balanced risk management strategies. This article lays the conceptual groundwork for combining social scientific and geophysical approaches and recommends citizen science demonstration projects accompanied by social scientific research to evaluate this approach. As case example, the planned implementation of the participatory monitoring approach within the DeepStor project is presented. Our findings aim to contribute to the ongoing discourse on sustainable energy transition, risk management and governance, and the role of public participation in geothermal energy development.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this study is to report a low-cost electroless deposition (EN) process of Ni-P thin films using a wet-chemical process on flexible polyimide substrate (Kapton ® 300HN DuPont™), comprising surface functionalization with NaOH, nucleation with Sn and Pd, and acceleration with HCl. The pretreatment performed on the polyimide surface was investigated using a contact angle system and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Structural, morphological and electrical characterization of the Ni-P film were performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), stylus scan profiler, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and four-point probe measurements. The results showed that the pretreatment of the flexible polyimide enables a faster EN process, with lower thermal expenses, delivering a compact, spherical shaped Ni-P film -free of holes, scratches, and flaws, with particle size ranging from 380 to 780 nm.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Herbarium specimens are invaluable for studying plant. Yet their potential to reveal historical plant-associated microbiomes remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we reconstructed the temporal and spatial dynamics of foliar fungal endophytes in Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) by sequencing the fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region from herbarium needle specimens collected in Finland between 1861 and 2023. We analyzed community shifts across 50-year and 20-year intervals and between southern and northern regions, assessing the influence of temperature and precipitation. The results showed that the community was dominated by Ascomycota, with Lophodermium , Ceratocystis , Yarrowia , Saccharomyces , and basidiomycete Heterobasidion as the most abundant genera. Among the 50-year intervals, H. parviporum was detected, and the abundance of Lophodermium picea increased in 20-year interval (2001–2023, P &lt; 0.05). The fungal community composition differed significantly between the interval 1951–2000 and both 1851–1900 and 1901–1950 ( P &lt; 0.05). The southern region exhibited distinct fungal community and lower alpha diversity indices compared to the north ( P &lt; 0.05). Functional prediction revealed that pathogen relevant traits and saprotroph relevant traits were dominant modes across the samples. While temporal and spatial factors significantly structured the communities, no direct correlation with historical temperature or precipitation was found. Our findings demonstrate that herbarium specimens are a powerful resource for uncovering long-term microbial dynamics and highlight the primary roles of time and geography in shaping the foliar mycobiome.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Soil microbiota are key players of terrestrial ecosystem functioning, including decomposition, soil organic matter formation, and nutrient cycling, and interact strongly with plants in the rhizosphere. Several studies have demonstrated the potential of plants to alter soil microbiome assembly and functioning (i.e., through manipulation of soil organic matter pools via root exudation), which can be critical for sustaining soil ecosystem functioning. Using soil from a long-term biodiversity experiment in Germany, we investigated how soil microbial communities responded to variations in plant species richness (1–16 species), functional group richness (1–4 groups), and plant identity (grasses, legumes, small herbs, and tall herbs) using 16S rRNA gene and ITS amplicon sequencing. We examined bacterial and fungal community structure, metabolic potential, and microbial network architecture to better understand the role of the soil microbiome and its net positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Results Plant diversity induced gradual shifts in microbial community composition, while increasing soil organic carbon and nitrogen stocks. Microbial networks exhibited increased connectivity, particularly between bacteria and fungi. Meanwhile, mutualistic and antagonistic functional guild representation increased, that is the sum total of plant-beneficial (i.e., endophytes) and plant- or fungi-detrimental (i.e., pathogens and parasites) fungal guilds, respectively. Key nodes shifted from generalist taxa at low plant diversity to more specialized communities at high plant diversity. Notably, fungi responded more strongly than bacteria, and their functional potential was driven by plant functional identity rather than species richness. Conclusion At low plant diversity, generalist taxa likely exploit less complex and diverse organic carbon inputs, allowing them to dominate available niches. In contrast, higher plant diversity promotes a broader array of specialist taxa that likely benefit from the greater diversity of organic carbon compounds, and thus greater niche availability. As network complexity grows, ecosystem functions are being distributed across more taxa, leading to greater microbiome stability, and ultimately more efficient soil carbon and nutrient cycling. Our findings suggest that higher plant diversity strengthens microbial functioning and enhances microbiome resilience, that is the capacity of the microbial community to maintain soil functioning despite environmental disturbances.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Cutting-edge dual process health behavior theories propose micro-temporal within-person processes to be critical drivers of physical activity participation. Self-efficacy is the pivotal motivation-oriented correlate of physical activity, a key component across the most prominent health behavior change theories, and has predominantly been researched as stable interpersonal ‘trait’ factor. However, the micro-temporal within-person ‘state’ perspective on self-efficacy remains uncharted. Objectives To tackle this research gap, we conducted a scoping review and examined (1) time-sensitive (i.e., assessment time span) and (2) theory-conform operationalization of self-efficacy measures as well as (3) within-person variance reports from ecological momentary assessment studies in the physical activity context among healthy adults. Methods A scoping review of English articles using PsycINFO, PsycArticles, PSYNDEX, SPORTDiscus and PubMed was conducted up to September 2025. Eligible studies focused on (1) physical activity in (2) healthy adults aged + 18 years and (3) applied multiple within-day, daily or weekly assessments of self-efficacy. Findings were summarized through quantitative analysis of the evidence. Results A total of 13 studies was included. Most studies assessed self-efficacy through multiple assessments per day and with a focus on the near future (i.e., next few hours post ecological momentary assessment). The 13 identified self-efficacy items were operationalized according to self-efficacy theory, but varied in semantics, psychometrics, and source. Five studies reported intraclass correlation coefficients that revealed self-efficacy within-person variance to range between 51% and 89%. Conclusions Given the pivotal role of self-efficacy across various health-behavior theories and the recent relevance attributed to micro-temporal within-subject processes, thus far surprisingly few studies researched how self-efficacy unfolds within-persons across time. However, the few studies identified provide initial evidence that self-efficacy varies within individuals across time in everyday life, including a tendency towards higher within-person variance for momentary versus day level assessments, and thereby empirically supporting dual process models. Items were assessed dynamically using repeated measures per day and according to theory but differed in conceptual and semantic features. Future research is encouraged to further investigate how self-efficacy unfolds across time, by testing various sampling strategies and applying advanced designs to shed light on the precise timing of effects and to inform adaptive and expedient intervention development.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Infertility is a major public health issue with a 17.5% estimated lifetime prevalence. Despite advances in assisted reproductive technology (ART), almost half of those seeking ART end all treatment cycles without a child. Around 93% of patients want to be prepared and supported when facing unsuccessful treatment. Healthcare professionals perceive a high demand for such support, yet evidence-based interventions remain limited. This mixed-methods study evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of implementing and evaluating Beyond Fertility: a brief psychosocial intervention to promote patients’ adjustment to the end of unsuccessful fertility treatment. Results will inform the design of a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) of Beyond Fertility. Methods This is a prospective, mixed-methods, single-arm pilot study. The Beyond Fertility intervention offers preventive care (one individual/couple session before patients start their last treatment cycle) and early interventive care (one individual/couple and five group sessions if treatment is unsuccessful) to promote patients’ emotional and social adjustment to the end of unsuccessful treatment. Beyond Fertility’s development integrated feedback from patients and healthcare professionals. Adults scheduled to start their last NHS-reimbursed in vitro fertilisation/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) cycle, including the last transfer with own or donated gametes/embryos or preimplantation genetic testing (PGT)—at a large NHS hospital in Portugal were consecutively recruited. Participants completed online questionnaires at baseline (T1, pre-intervention), post-individual/couple sessions (T2), and post-intervention (T3). A post-intervention focus group (T3) gathered feedback on the intervention and the study protocol. Participants also completed online open-ended feasibility questions after each intervention session. Feasibility outcomes focused on demand, acceptability, implementation, practicality, and promise of efficacy. Exploratory analysis of efficacy was change in quality of life (FertiQoL, T1–T3). Results Thirty-two participants consented to participate, completed T1, and were allocated to Beyond Fertility (62.1% acceptance rate). Participants reported that preventive care was acceptable, feasible, and beneficial. After a negative cycle outcome, 30.0% ( n = 9) of participants ended treatment, and most ( n = 21, 70.0%) continued. Of those who ended treatment, most ( n = 6, 66.7%) accepted the interventive care, reporting it helped them accept their unmet desire for children and pursue alternative life goals. One-third ( n = 3, 33.3%) received all sessions. Reasons for non-acceptance or withdrawal from the intervention in the immediate aftermath of treatment were the emotional burden of unsuccessful treatment (33.3%) and the sessions’ group format (22.2%). Facilitators of session uptake were flexible online/in-person scheduling and delivery. Individual quality-of-life trajectories suggested a possible recovery after unsuccessful treatment. Conclusions Beyond Fertility was seen as adequate and valued, and it showed promise in improving patients’ quality of life after unsuccessful treatment. Before efficacy testing, feasibility issues require changes to Beyond Fertility’s logic model, including activity design and revisions to its evaluation to target a larger, more representative sample of participants.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The needle nematode genus Paralongidorus Siddiqi, Hooper &amp; Khan, 1963 currently comprises 76 species of polyphagous plant ectoparasites with global distribution. Here, we revise the taxonomic ambiguities within the genus and update the polytomous key to facilitate species identification. Integrating ribosomal (D2–D3 expansion segments of 28S, ITS, partial 18S) and mitochondrial (partial COI mtDNA) markers, we reassess phylogenetic relationships within Paralongidorus and Longidorus . Our analyses reveal that Paralongidorus is paraphyletic, consistently resolving into two distinct subclades. We describe Paralongidorus cantabronavarrus sp. nov. from northern Spain, a species characterized by both molecular placement and morphological traits, including a uniquely anterior vulval position (V = 26–29%), the most extreme reported within the genus. This feature may represent a derived developmental adaptation, with potential ecological significance. Amphidial fovea morphology also shows evidence of convergent evolution, complicating generic boundaries. These findings challenge the validity of Longidoroides , reinforce the separation between Paralongidorus and Longidorus , and highlight the value of integrative approaches in resolving long-standing taxonomic uncertainties. The phylogenetic placement of P. cantabronavarrus sp. nov. is consistent across markers and aligns with previous studies. Overall, this work expands our understanding of Paralongidorus biodiversity in the Iberian Peninsula and underscores the need for further intensive nematological surveys in this area.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Braille is a tactile writing system that enables individuals to read through the sense of touch. Although letter recognition research in the visual modality has informed reading instruction debates, the processes underlying braille letter recognition have received comparatively less attention which has led to little input from researchers toward educators. In this study, we first quantified the formal properties of braille dots using measures of cue validity and entropy-based informativeness, and we tested whether the 26 letters of the braille alphabet were linearly separable in the six-dimensional binary space defined by dot presence. We then examined letter discriminability in fluent Spanish braille readers using a same–different task that included all possible letter combinations. From participants’ accuracy and response time data, we constructed perceptual similarity matrices and applied hierarchical clustering to characterize the structure of braille letter similarity. The resulting clusters revealed a structured perceptual space that reflected both local dot features and global configurations. These results provide a characterization of the perceptual structure of the braille alphabet and show constraints on tactile letter recognition that extend beyond dot overlap, offering a benchmark to guide experimental control, instructional sequencing of letters, and computational models of tactile letter recognition.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Introduction Ongoing developments in interventional radiology have enabled the treatment of various musculoskeletal inflammatory disorders via super-selective embolization of abnormal areas of neovascularization. The current convention is to utilize vascular sheaths in these procedures. This study explored a single-center experience with a novel approach utilizing a sheathless microcatheter cannulation technique without the conventional vascular sheath. Material and methods A single-center retrospective chart review was conducted, including all eligible adult patients for whom a super-selective embolization was performed to treat an MSK inflammatory disorder between August 2024 and March 2025. The pre-procedural medical records and imaging were reviewed to determine satisfaction of inclusion criteria. The fluoroscopic images from the angiography suite and procedure notes were reviewed to determine technical success and immediate complications. Results Twenty-seven procedures were performed for 19 patients. The average age was 47.5 ± 10 years old. The majority of patients were female (13; 68.5%). The most common procedure indication was for treatment of plantar fasciitis with 14 procedures (51.9%). The embolic material of choice was imipenem-cilastatin in all but one procedure (26; 96.3%). The commonest microcatheter size was 1.7 French (21; 77.8%), and the preferred access vessel was the common femoral artery (17; 63%). The technical success rate was 100% without immediate complications. No major post-procedural complications were encountered. Only one minor access site hematoma complication was reported. Conclusion This novel sheathless microcatheter approach was found to be feasible, safe, and effective without major complications within our limited sample size.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Open pine woodlands occur throughout the southeastern United States. Thinning and prescribed fire commonly are used to establish and manage pine woodlands for multiple objectives, often including timber production and wildlife habitat. Although fire effects in loblolly and shortleaf pine woodlands have been summarized widely, the effects of fire during all seasons of the year are not well understood. We implemented 72 burns at 9 sites throughout the southeastern US, 2020–2023, to evaluate how fire treatment during the dormant, early growing-, mid-growing-, and late growing-season on a 2-year fire-return interval may affect understory composition, structure, and species diversity indices. Results Fire intensity and burn coverage were greatest in the dormant-season treatment and least in the mid-growing-season treatment. Coverage of semi-woody and woody plants in the understory was less in all treatments compared to control. However, after two fire events, coverage of semi-woody and woody understory plants increased in the dormant-season treatment and woody understory plants increased in the mid-growing-season treatment, whereas neither increased in the early- and late growing-season treatments. These results indicate growing-season fire sets-back semi-woody and woody vegetation better than dormant-season fire if intensity is adequate to top-kill the plants. Forb coverage increased following all seasons of burning, but the increase was greatest in the late growing-season treatment. Coverage of graminoids decreased in control and in the mid- and late growing-season treatments, partially because of fire timing and because understory sunlight was reduced from an average of 54% to 39% over 4 years as overstory tree crowns expanded following thinning. Percent visual obstruction was least following early growing-season fire. Understory species richness increased in all treatments as well as control. Conclusion We documented changes in plant composition and structure as related to fire seasonality and intensity after 2 fire events on a 2-year fire-return interval. All fire treatments changed understory composition, and each produced different effects that could allow managers to better meet objectives in systems dominated by Southern yellow pines. Growing-season fire offers more flexibility throughout the year to accomplish objectives, including wildlife habitat management, beyond the traditional dormant-season burn window.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Objective To determine the efficacy of salvage intratympanic corticosteroid therapy in patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL) who exhibited an insufficient response to initial systemic corticosteroids. Material and methods In this retrospective quasi-experimental study, ISSNHL patients treated from 2019 to 2024 were included. Pure tone audiometry (PTA) thresholds were measured at baseline (pre-treatment), after systemic corticosteroids, and three months post-final intervention. Outcomes were defined as. • Complete recovery: final mean PTA ≤ 10 dB poorer than the unaffected ear or pre-loss baseline. • Partial recovery: ≥ 10 dB PTA improvement, yet final PTA still &gt; 10 dB poorer. • No recovery: &lt; 10 dB PTA improvement. A secondary binary classification categorized patients as “recovered” (≥ 10 dB PTA gain) or “non-recovered” (&lt; 10 dB gain). Results Systemic corticosteroids achieved a significant mean PTA improvement of 5.6 dB (p = 0.001) in this group (patients with no complete recovery after oral treatment). Subsequent intratympanic therapy added a further 1.76 dB gain, though this was not statistically significant (p = 0.115). After systemic therapy, 27.9% of patients attained partial recovery; 72.1% showed no improvement. At final follow-up, 9.3% achieved complete recovery, 29.1% partial recovery, and 61.6% no recovery. According to the binary criterion, 38.4% were classified as recovered post-intratympanic treatment, a non-significant increase (p = 0.078). Conclusions These findings indicate that systemic corticosteroid therapy provides a notable audiometric benefit in ISSNHL. However, in this cohort, salvage intratympanic steroid therapy did not yield a statistically significant additional effect. Further prospective, controlled trials are warranted to clarify the role of intratympanic steroids for patients with incomplete systemic response.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background and aims The incidence of diaphragmatic-palsy following interscalene brachial plexus block (IBPB) is almost 100% where the drug volume plays a significant role. We compared the incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paresis and the success rate following IBPB using three different volumes of local anaesthetics. Methods Ninety patients undergoing shoulder and arm surgeries under ultrasound-guided IBPB were randomly allocated into three groups: Group A (10 ml), Group B (15 ml), and Group C (20 ml). The drug administered was 0.75% ropivacaine with 50 mcg dexmedetomidine. The diaphragm excursion was measured before and 30 min after the block on the side of surgery. The incidence of diaphragmatic palsy and its severity were noted. The success rate following block, the onset of sensory blockade, duration of postoperative analgesia, and adverse effects were observed in all three groups. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS software. Results The demographic data, duration of surgery, and success rate following block were statistically insignificant. The hemidiaphragmatic paresis (&lt; 25%, 25–75%, &gt; 75%) in Group A (29,1,0), Group B (17,13,0), and Group C (15,8,7) was statistically significant ( P value &lt; 0.001). The onset of sensory blockade was Group A (7.06 ± 0.73 min), Group B (6.23 ± 0.72 min), and Group C (4.61 ± 0.63 min) with a P value &lt; 0.001. The duration of postoperative analgesia in Group A (440 ± 48.42 min), Group B (429 ± 44.48 min), and Group C (411 ± 51.37 min) was statistically insignificant ( P value-0.072). Five patients in Group C developed hoarseness of voice postoperatively, which was managed conservatively. Conclusion Low volume ultrasound guided interscalene block (10 ml) is associated with a lower incidence of hemidiaphragmatic paresis with a similar success rate and duration of postoperative analgesia. Higher volume of the drug yields a faster onset of the sensory blockade.",

In medical laboratories, it has shown notable anti-bacterial effectiveness in treating diabetic foot infections and related issues. New medication development frequently targets (AMPs), which are certainly ensuing components of adaptive immune system. The findings of this research employs deep learning to identify antibiotic activity. Numerous computational methods have been established to detect antimicrobial peptides via deep learning algorithms. We introduced a novel deep learning approach called antimicrobial peptides using Capsule Neural Network (AMP-CapsNet) to precisely forecast them and evaluated its efficacy against deep learning and baseline models. AMPs prediction using capsule neural networks, a type of next generation neural network, to build prediction models. Additionally, we utilized Amino Acid Composition (AAC) for effective features encoded method and as well as dipeptide composition (DPC). Every model underwent independent cross-validation and external testing. The findings indicate that the enhanced AMP-CapsNet deep learning model surpassed its counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 97.29% and an AUC score of 98.91% on the test set using with dipeptide Composition (DPC). The proposed AMP-CapsNet demonstrates superior performance of the testing set achieved accuracy 97.29% score with DPC and accuracy 84.42% score with AAC approach. Consequently, the technique we advocate is anticipated to enhance the accuracy of antimicrobial peptide predictions in the future. By producing powerful peptides for medication development and application, this study advances deep learning-based AMP drug discovery approaches. This finding has important ramifications for how biological data is processed and how pharmacology is calculated.",

    "Abstract": "<ns3:p>Background After witnessing the implementations of Banach fixed point theory which is stated that a mapping T: X→X has always a unique fixed point in X in giving the existence and uniqueness solutions for many integral and differential equations, various extensions of Banach fixed point theory were established. Consequently, the theory has evolved to encompass diverse extensions and is fruitful in many fields. One of the most significant advances in pure and applied mathematics is the discovery of solutions for linear and nonlinear systems as well fractal graphics, optimization theory, approximation theory, discrete dynamics and numerous other areas. Our main outcomes in this manuscript represent one of the most important of these extensions. Methods and Results Vital concepts such as D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces and weakly compatible maps are reviewed to establish the framework for our main results. The major objective of the present study is to investigate and verify the uniqueness of some common fixed point theorems for three pairs of self-maps under the influence of other enhanced categories of extended contractive conditions in the context of D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces. Our first main outcomes were established by applying the concepts of weak compatibility and common limit in the range property, whereas we obtained our second major results by utilizing the notion of occasionally weakly compatible mapping. Additionally, various common fixed point outcomes for the two pairs of self-maps were determined. Conclusion This manuscript explores novel outcomes regarding the uniqueness of various common fixed point theorems for three pairs of self-maps under the influence of other enhanced types of extended contractive conditions in the context of D d ∗ -Symmetric spaces. We anticipate that the discoveries in this manuscript will aid scientists in enhancing the authors on popularized extended symmetric-spaces to elevate a universal framework for their practical implementations in each advanced branches of science.</ns3:p>",

    "Abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are rapidly transforming modern medicine by helping in processing great volumes of clinical data with exceptional speed and accuracy. As medical knowledge expands and guidelines change, AI tools support the management of information overload and improve clinical workflows. The aim of this article is to review concrete examples of AI and ML applications across various medical specialties, focusing of their ability to accelerate processes and enhance diagnostic accuracy. In radiology, AI models demonstrate better performance in chest imaging and comparable accuracy in mammography compared to doctors, while reducing the impact of human factors such as fatigue. In cancer care, AI allows for multi-omics integration, precise pathological evaluation (e.g. GastroMIL model) and prognostic forecasting. Dermatological studies reveal that AI algorithms can outperform dermatologists in classifying skin leisons (72,1% vs 65,78% accuracy). In cardiology, AI enhances risk stratification beyond traditional scales and demonstrates higher sensitivity in ECG interpretation compared to healthcare professionals. Through real-time monitoring of hemodynamic stability and postoperative pain management, anesthesiology has integrated AI into clinical practice to improve accuracy of detection of hypotension by 40%. Preoperatively, AI provides assistance to assess risk and offers assistance to the perioperative team during the surgical procedure. AI also improves medical record documentation and decreases the administrative burden of documentation on the physician. AI systems currently augment our clinical intelligence by overcoming limitations in human cognition such as fatigue and algorithmically processing large volume datasets on a daily basis to improve diagnostic accuracy, treatment personalization and efficiency of healthcare.",

    "Abstract": "Strength degradation of steel structures due to corrosion is a significant durability concern globally, particularly in industrial environments where exposure to harsh conditions accelerates material deterioration. This study investigates the impact of long-term atmospheric corrosion on the mechanical properties and load-bearing capacity of circular hollow section (CHS) steel columns. The specimens dismantled from a substation structure exposed to an urban industrial environment for 30 years were subjected to tensile and axial compression experiments to analyze corrosion-induced deterioration. This research explores the correlation between corrosion rate and degradation of mechanical properties, such as yield strength, ultimate strength, and elasticity. A novel Corrosion-Mechanical Interaction Model is proposed to predict the remaining service life of corroded steel structures by integrating the effects of corrosion on these critical properties. Experimental results revealed a significant reduction in yield and ultimate strength due to uniform corrosion, with a direct linear relationship between the bearing capacity degradation and material loss. This study provides a crucial tool for engineers and infrastructure planners in managing the lifecycle of steel structures exposed to harsh environmental conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate attitude tracking of six degree of freedom electrohydraulic shaking tables (EHSTs) is restricted by parameter uncertainty, nonlinearity, strong coupling, and external disturbances. Existing sliding mode control schemes are limited by fixed switching gains and the absence of integral compensation, which restrict steady-state accuracy and dynamic adaptability under nonlinear hydraulic effects and multi-axis coupling. An Adaptive Integral Sliding Mode Control (AISMC) scheme is developed to address these factors through two coordinated elements: an integral sliding surface that removes steady state deviation caused by static disturbances such as servo valve dead zones and hydraulic leakage, and an adaptive switching gain that regulates the reaching dynamics online without reliance on conservative bounds; a decay term in the gain update restrains parameter drift and keeps the adaptation bounded. Lyapunov analysis establishes closed loop stability and finite time convergence of the tracking error under bounded uncertainties and excitations. Simulation studies on a six degree of freedom EHST with a broadband random reference (0.1-10 Hz, 10 mm) compare AISMC with Sliding Mode Control (SMC) along <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mi>X</mml:mi> </mml:math> , <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mi>Y</mml:mi> </mml:math> , and <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mi>Z</mml:mi> </mml:math> . Pose tracking shows consistent gains, with the maximum value reduced by about 11.5-11.9 % and the root mean square (RMS) reduced by about 34.9-35.1 %. Pose error decreases from 0.392-0.396 mm to 0.035-0.036 mm in maximum value and from 0.175-0.177 mm to 0.015-0.016 mm in RMS.

    "Abstract": "In response to the growing environmental concerns over conventional plastic packaging, this study developed soy protein isolate (SPI) films incorporated with sea buckthorn pomace (SBP), a bioactive-rich agro-industrial byproduct, for use in active meat packaging. Biocomposite films were fabricated via solution casting with SBP concentrations of 0-5% (w/w). Incorporation of 3% SBP led to a significant enhancement in material properties: tensile strength (TS) increased by 45% (to 5.5 ± 0.4 MPa), Young’s modulus (YM) doubled (to 85.7 ± 6.2 MPa), water vapor permeability (WVP) decreased by 30% (to 1.50 ± 0.08 × 10⁻ 1 ⁰ g·m/m 2 ·s·Pa), and oxygen permeability dropped by ∼33% (to 3.9 ± 0.2 × 10⁻ 1 ⁴ cm 3 ·m/m 2 ·s·Pa) compared to control films. DPPH and ABTS assays revealed that antioxidant activity reached 65.8% and 75.2%, respectively, for 5% SBP films. Application to pork loin preservation at 4°C over 15 days demonstrated that SPI-SBP 3% films suppressed lipid oxidation by over 50% (Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) reduced from 1.85 to 0.85 mg MDA/kg) and curtailed microbial growth (Total viable count (TVC) reduced by ∼2 log CFU/g), while also minimizing weight loss. These outcomes confirm the dual role of SBP as a structural and functional enhancer, reinforcing the utility of SPI-SBP films as biodegradable, bioactive alternatives to petroleum-based meat packaging, with added value from agro-industrial waste valorization.",

    "Abstract": "This bibliometric study scrutinizes a corpus of 776 academic articles, focusing on the intersection of virology and neuroregeneration, published in the timeframe from 1970 to 2024. The annual growth rate was calculated at 3.37%, with an average citation count of 19.8 per publication. The geographical analysis identified China and the United States as principal nodes of collaboration. The most prolific contributor to this field was Verhaagen J, with a portfolio of 48 articles and a fractionalized citation count of 7.69. A recurring theme in the discourse was the use of animal models, as evidenced by frequent references to rats, mice, axotomy, genetic vectors, and nerve regeneration. Thematic cluster analysis unveiled 10 distinct categories, encapsulating topics such as “nerve regeneration” and “animals.” Since 2020, COVID-19 has emerged as a new area of investigation. The field has evolved from foundational methodologies in the 1990s to comprehensive studies in the 2000s, and more recently, to research aiming for practical applications. However, gaps in our understanding persist, particularly concerning the viral mechanisms that promote neuroregeneration, the employment of advanced gene therapy vectors, the implications of emerging viruses like COVID-19, and the potential for harnessing virally-induced inflammation for neural repair. The corpus comprises 320 sources, predominantly neuroscience journals such as the Journal of Neuroscience and Experimental Neurology. Publication trends show steady growth from 2000 to 2010, a significant surge from 2010 to 2015, and stability over the past decade. This analysis gauges the extent of collaboration, the knowledge structure, and the growth patterns in virus and neuroregeneration research. Despite substantial growth in the discipline, unresolved questions remain regarding endogenous regeneration pathways, efficient gene delivery, the impact of COVID-19, and inflammation control. Empirical investigations hold the potential to significantly enhance the practical application of viral knowledge in neuroregenerative medicine. In conclusion, this bibliometric review synthesizes the current understanding and delineates future research directions in leveraging viruses for brain regeneration following injury or disease.",

    "Abstract": "Background The Sree Narayandasji Santram Maharaj improving hemodialysis outcomes initiative (SNSMDS) is a prospective, multicenter observational study to assess patient survival and quality of life (QoL) of incident patients on maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). Materials and Methods The study population included patients with incident adult patients staring MHD between April 2019 and December 2022 from 30 dialysis centers across West, Central, and South India. QoL was measured using a detailed EuroQOL-5-Dimensional 3-Level (EQ5D3L) based questionnaire. Results A total of 1039 (728 males and 311 females) patients on MHD were enrolled; the mean age was 49.06 ± 14.96 years (Males: 48.92 ± 15.20 years, Females: 49.37 ± 14.36 years). The survival of a patient on MHD in the present cohort was 94.1%, 86.6%, 77.9%, 58.4%, and 47.1% at 4 months, 8 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. In univariate analysis, increasing age (HR 1.014(1.01-1.02), p &lt;0.001) and presence of diabetes (HR 1.614(1.28-2.03), p &lt;0.001) were significantly associated with poor survival, whereas well educated (HR 0.592(0.043-0.82), p =0.002) had increased survival. Multivariate regression analysis revealed 1.5% added risk of death with every year spent on MHD. Insignificant difference is observed in the EQ5D3L score at enrollment (6.47 ± 1.73), and at the end of median follow-up of 12 months (6.49 ± 1.65) ( p =0.837). Conclusion Incident patients on hemodialysis had a 1-year survival rate of 77.9% and a 3-year survival rate of 47.1%. Overall QoL among hemodialysis patients did not improve significantly despite dialysis.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Non-invasive neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) enhances cortical excitability and muscle protein synthesis. Serum neurofilament light chain (NFL) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels are negatively correlated with the modified rankin score (mRS) and predict poor outcomes 3 months following a stroke. This study aimed to assess the effect of non-invasive early NMES on upper limb paresis and serum NFL and MMP-9 levels at 3-month follow-up. Materials and Methods: This quasi-experimental trial was conducted in the inpatient department from February 2021 to January 2023, included 54 first-ever ischemic stroke patients with stroke severity 2–4 on mRS, divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group received non-invasive early NMES plus standard rehabilitation, and the control group received standard rehabilitation only. Primary outcomes included upper extremity Fugl–Meyer assessment (FMA) sub-sections A, A-D, and mRS. Secondary outcomes were serum NFL and MMP-9 levels, which were assessed at baseline and a 3-month follow-up. Results: Significant differences were observed between intervention and control groups at 3 months follow-up in mRS, 1 (1–2) and 3 (2–3) P &lt; 0.01, Fugl-Meyer assessment-upper extremity (FMA-UE)- A 29 (19–32) and 15 (11–19), P &lt; 0.01, FMA-upper extremity sub-scale A-D-FU 53 (33–60) and 34 (25–49) P = 0.02.

Materials and Methods: A prospective randomized controlled study was carried out in which the study group underwent florescence guided surgery (FGS) and was compared with non-FGS control group. Evaluation was done on EOR and gross total resection (GTR) based on radiological imaging. Karnofsky performance status (KPS), length of hospital stay, and survival rate were also evaluated. Results: Thirty-two patients (16 in each group) with Grade 3/4 gliomas with comparable pre-operative clinical features and tumor volume were recruited. In the study group, the mean EOR was found to be 95.13% and the control group showed an EOR of 85.19%, which was statistically significant ( P = 0.046). There was also a statistically significant difference in GTR rates ( P = 0.046) and KPS at 3 months (0.050) between the two groups. Conclusion: Microscopic fluorescein-guided resection of HGGs is feasible and safe. The present study was able to demonstrate higher rates of EOR and GTR in the FGS group, which resulted in a higher KPS score as compared to the non-FGS group.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Healthcare providers often prescribe and administer oxygen inappropriately in emergency settings, contributing to a significant knowledge gap. This can have devastating consequences, with at least 1.4million deaths attributed to inadequate or improper oxygen therapy. We aimed to evaluate the use of oxygen therapy &amp; its barriers among doctors and nurses. Materials &amp; Methods: A descriptive, hospital-based cross-sectional study. Data were collected electronically via Google Forms; the questionnaire included professional characteristics, educational background, awareness and use of oxygen therapy guidelines, oxygen delivery practices, and barriers. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and the association between variables was explored using the Chi-square test at P&lt;0.05. Results: 200 healthcare professionals participated in this study, comprising 159 (79.5%) doctors and 41 (20.5%) nurses. One hundred and thirty-one (82.4%) doctors and thirty-six (87.8%) nurses demonstrated good knowledge of oxygen therapy, p - 0.002. 145 (72.5%) of participants were evaluated as having a good level of practice. The majority, 190 (95%), believed that malfunctioning oxygen cylinders and concentrators were barriers to the adequate use of oxygen therapy. 170 (85.5%) had no special training in oxygen therapy. 63 (31.5%) were aware of oxygen therapy guidelines, but only 53 (26.5%) had applied these guidelines. Conclusion: Doctors and nurses demonstrate a good knowledge and practice of oxygen therapy; however, a training gap exists. To bridge this gap, regular educational programs on oxygen therapy based on the latest guidelines are essential to ensure best practices and optimal care.",

    "Abstract": "The rapidly growing game industry makes it difficult for players to find games that match their preferences. Conventional recommendation methods are often unsatisfactory due to a lack of personalization. This study aims to design and build a web-based game recommendation system using the content-based filtering method by leveraging a fine-tuned Transformer embedding model, all-MPNet-base-v2, to deeply analyze the textual content of games. The research methodology included data collection from the Steam API (43,900 games), text preprocessing with TF-IDF for keyword extraction, and significantly, fine-tuning the all-MPNet-base-v2 model using the Knowledge Distillation method with jina-embedding-v3 as the teacher model. A novel game series identification feature using fuzzy string matching was also implemented. The resulting embedding vectors were indexed using LanceDB and deployed in a Flask web application. The research contributions are the successful domain-specific adaptation of MPNet via Knowledge Distillation and the implementation of the series identification feature. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated the fine-tuned model's superiority, achieving substantial improvements over the baseline in MRR@10 (0.5857), MAP@10 (0.5149), and Hit Rate@3 (0.90). User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with 15 respondents showed high acceptance (92.89%). Limitations include the Steam-only dataset, potential information loss from TF-IDF, and the small UAT sample size. This study confirms that fine-tuned Transformer embeddings within a content-based framework, enhanced by Knowledge Distillation, can produce effective, accurate, and well-received game recommendations, further improved by context-aware features like series identification.",

    "Abstract": "Addressing the growing need for sustainable innovation in PVC materials, this study presents an illustrative framework that develops and demonstrates an ontological system that integrates lifecycle simulation using Granta EduPack, systematic literature analysis (including bibliometric, thematic, and content analytics) of peer-reviewed publications, and Prot&eacute;g&eacute;-based semantic reasoning, and their combination, in a holistic manner. Material and use-phase data for PVC, HDPE, PP, PET, and FRP cooling-tower components were sourced from ANSYS Granta EduPack Level-3 Polymer Sustainability 2023 R2 Version; 23.2.1, and a systematic analysis of the literature was then encoded as ontology classes, properties, and individuals following the Seven-Step ontology development method. Eco-audit simulations, standardised to a functional unit of 1 kg cooling tower fill material, reveal that the use phase dominates environmental impact (67 MJ primary energy, ~80% of total lifecycle), while material production and end-of-life recycling contribute ~15% and credits of ~900 MJ and 28 kg CO2 via recycling offsets. Ontology reasoning with corrected SWRL rules and SPARQL queries classifies VirginPVCRef and PVC10ES as strong structural materials (tensile strength &ge; 40 MPa), identifies PVCRH40 as high-moisture-risk (water absorption &gt; 0.10 g/g), and ranks hydro-thermal dechlorination (recyclability 0.90) over mechanical recycling (0.55). A systematic analysis of 40 Scopus-indexed publications (2015&ndash;2025) highlighted key themes in recycling technologies, LCA emissions, additive toxicity, ontology frameworks, machine learning integration, circular economy policy, and cooling-tower applications. Demonstrated via a simulation-based cooling-tower case study, hybrid PVC-FRP designs yield the highest justified Material Sustainability Performance Index (MSPI), outperforming PVC-only and FRP-only alternatives. This framework provides a conceptual decision-support tool for exploring PVC material optimisation, illustrating pathways to enhancing circularity and environmental responsibility in industrial applications. The proposed framework is, therefore, not intended as a validated decision-support tool, nor does it claim analytical optimisation or predictive performance but rather serves as a method of illustration that shows how domain knowledge can be formally structured using ontology principles linked to simulation representations, and that was examined for internal logical consistency.",

    "Abstract": "Parental practices strongly influence offspring development, and parental alcohol use may affect parenting behavior. However, most studies have focused on child-related outcomes. This review instead examined associations between parental drinking and parenting practices. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and Scopus identified 9053 articles. Of these, 222 full texts were screened by two reviewers, and 77 were included for critical appraisal. After quality assessment, 68 studies published between 1991 and 2026 were reviewed. Studies were included if they (i) measured parental alcohol use as a predictor and parenting practices as an outcome, (ii) involved offspring under 20 years, (iii) had a quantitative design, (iv) were peer-reviewed and published in English, and (v) excluded pregnancy measures and alcohol/parenting treatment interventions. Parenting factors (e.g., parent&ndash;child relationship, monitoring, communication, discipline, conflict, abuse) were categorized and grouped into general and alcohol-specific practices. Parental drinking was categorized into alcohol use disorders (AUD) and non-dependent alcohol use. Sixty-four studies reported at least one significant association between parental drinking and poorer parenting practices. Mixed results were observed for non-dependent drinking and alcohol-specific parenting. Some associations varied with parental gender. Overall, different drinking patterns appear to be linked to impaired parenting quality. Despite being the most common pattern of alcohol use, non-dependent drinking remains understudied in parenting research. The present review highlights several critical gaps in the literature, particularly regarding the relationship between non-dependent drinking, maternal AUD, and parenting practices. Moreover, contextual factors, such as socioeconomic status and gender differences, are insufficiently explored, limiting the understanding of heterogeneity in risk and outcomes. Future research would benefit from employing robust longitudinal designs and expanding geographical representation, in order to capture variation across sociocultural contexts and enhance the generalizability of findings.",

    "Abstract": "Oxidative and nitrosative stress are key contributors to the development and progression of chronic inflammatory disorders, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (viz., Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease). Cholinergic dysfunction is a major hallmark of Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease and is closely associated with these processes. Red seaweeds are rich in bioactive compounds that have been increasingly investigated for their potential to modulate these processes. This review aims to examine the role of major red seaweed-derived metabolites in regulating redox imbalance, immunomodulatory capacity and acetylcholinesterase activity, with emphasis on in vitro studies. An analysis of peer-reviewed literature was conducted, focusing on chemical, biochemical and cell-based assays. Studies assessed antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory effects, and acetylcholinesterase inhibition of isolated compounds/fractions of red seaweed using established methods, including radical scavenging assays, Griess-based nitrite assay and enzyme inhibition assays. Sulfated polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), phycoerythrin, bromophenols, phlorotannin and terpenoid-derived metabolites demonstrated antioxidant capacity through radical scavenging, metal chelation and modulation of endogenous antioxidants. They also modulated inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. In vitro evidence supports red seaweed-derived compounds as promising modulators of redox homeostasis, inflammation and cholinergic function, highlighting their relevance as functional food ingredients, while underscoring the need for in vivo and clinical validation.",

    "Abstract": "This scoping review explores how critical pedagogy has been conceptualized and implemented in school-based health education between 2014 and 2025. Grounded in Freirean principles, the review addresses a growing call to move beyond biomedical, behaviorist models toward equity-oriented, dialogical, and empowering educational practices. A systematic search across five academic databases identified 21 peer-reviewed studies applying critical pedagogy frameworks in primary and secondary schools and teacher education. The analysis was guided by the PRISMA-ScR framework and involved inductive thematic synthesis using NVivo. Results were organized across three analytical axes: temporal clustering (pre- and post-pandemic), seven overarching pedagogical themes, and five phases of conceptual evolution. Findings show a trajectory from early embodied and feminist frameworks toward post-pandemic ecological, decolonial, and digital pedagogies. Despite regional innovations&mdash;particularly in New Zealand, Australia, and Europe&mdash;implementation remains constrained by institutional resistance, policy standardization, and curricular tensions. This review identifies key implications for educational policy, curriculum reform, teacher training, and future research. It argues that critical pedagogy offers a timely, transformative alternative for advancing health equity and social justice in global school health education.",

    "Abstract": "Precision nutrition has emerged as a promising strategy for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by targeting molecular pathways underlying insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism. Accumulating evidence indicates that dietary patterns, caloric intake, and specific nutrients can modulate gene expression and epigenetic mechanisms involved in insulin signaling, inflammation, and energy homeostasis. This narrative review synthesizes recent human and experimental studies (2025&ndash;2026) examining how dietary components influence transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in the context of T2DM prevention. A total of 29 peer-reviewed studies were included, encompassing dietary patterns, macronutrient manipulation, micronutrient and bioactive supplementation, and gene&ndash;diet interactions. Very-low-calorie diets consistently induced coordinated modulation of key metabolic genes, including downregulation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and upregulation of PDK4, CPT1, and AMPK, reflecting a metabolic shift toward enhanced fatty acid oxidation and improved insulin sensitivity. In contrast, high-fat and fructose-rich diets promoted proinflammatory gene expression and immune activation, contributing to insulin resistance. Plant-based and vegan dietary patterns were associated with reduced epigenetic aging and improved insulin sensitivity through DNA methylation changes. Targeted interventions, including vitamin D combined with probiotics, dietary fiber, nucleotides, and trace elements such as copper, further demonstrated favorable transcriptional and epigenetic effects linked to improved glycemic control. Collectively, these findings highlight diet-driven modulation of insulin signaling and glucose metabolism at the molecular level and support nutrigenomics-guided precision nutrition as a viable preventive approach for T2DM. Integrating genetic and epigenetic insights into dietary strategies may enable more personalized and effective interventions to curb the growing global burden of type 2 diabetes.",

    "Abstract": "The present study examined the influence of motivation on measures of cognitive ability within the domains of attention control, primary memory, secondary memory, and fluid intelligence. Three tasks measuring each respective domain were administered, allowing for latent-variable analyses of the cognitive constructs. Half of participants (n = 322) were assigned to an experimental condition in which they received trial-by-trial and/or block-by-block feedback about their performance in addition to normative information regarding their performance. The other half (n = 322) were assigned to a 'no feedback' condition. The constructs were differentially sensitive to the between-subjects manipulation, with all three attention control tasks showing significantly better performance with feedback, and two of the three secondary memory tasks showing performance improvements with feedback. None of the primary memory or fluid intelligence tasks were affected by feedback. Individual differences in self-reported motivation were only weakly correlated with performance in all four domains. We discuss the implications for these results for the testing of cognitive theories using individual differences, high- versus low-stakes testing, and the role of motivation in cognitive assessment.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is the most common inherited hemolytic anemia in populations of northern European descent, arising from mutations in genes encoding key erythrocyte membrane proteins, including ANK1, SPTB, SLC4A1, SPTA1 , and EPB42 . These genetic defects disrupt the vertical linkages between the red blood cell (RBC) plasma membrane and its underlying cytoskeleton, reducing RBC deformability and leading to characteristic spherocytosis, premature hemolysis, and accelerated splenic clearance. Inheritance is predominantly autosomal dominant, although autosomal recessive forms occur, particularly involving SPTA1 and EPB42. Clinically, HS manifests with anemia, jaundice, splenomegaly, and complications such as cholelithiasis. This study aimed to identify and characterize pathogenic variants in primary HS genes, establish genotype–phenotype correlations, and enhance diagnostic accuracy to guide personalized management within a defined cohort. Diagnostic advancements, notably the tests of next-generation sequencing and the eosin-5-maleimide binding test, have improved the detection of genetic heterogeneity, yet regional underdiagnosis persists. A comprehensive understanding of the HS genetic spectrum is therefore critical not only for precise diagnosis and optimized patient care but also for informing the development of future gene-targeted therapies, including CRISPR-based approaches. Regional epidemiological investigations, including limited data from Iraq, suggest that HS remains underdiagnosed despite its significant clinical impact. A comprehensive understanding of the HS genetic spectrum is imperative for accurate diagnosis, optimized personalized management, and the eventual development of gene-based therapeutic interventions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract: BACKGROUND: Low platelet counts resulting from increased platelet breakdown and poor platelet generation are the hallmarks of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an autoimmune illness. Romiplostim increases platelet counts in the majority of patients and lowers bleeding risk in those with ITP. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the median dose of romiplostim required to maintain platelet counts ≥50 × 10 9 /L and to assess platelet response rates among adult Iraqi patients with primary ITP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cross-sectional study looked at 200 patients’ ages ≥14 years who had primary ITP that failed 1 st line treatment. They were treated at Baghdad Medical City from May 2022 to December 2023. Medical records were used to get the information. Romiplostim (Nplate ® , Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA) was injected subcutaneously once a week. The dose started at 1 μg/kg and was increased by 1 μg/kg each time to keep the platelet numbers between 50 and 200 × 10 9 /L (maximum 10 μg/kg). RESULTS: Among 200 patients (60% female), the median age was 38 years and the median treatment duration was 4 months. The median weekly dosage of romiplostim was 250 μg and the median baseline platelet count was 19 × 10 9 /L, which significantly increased to 138 × 10 9 /L after romiplostim therapy ( P = 0.011). A total of 73.5% of patients achieved a platelet response ≥ 50 × 10 9 /L. There was no significant difference in response between patients aged ≥ 60 years and those &lt; 60 years ( P = 0.25). CONCLUSIONS: Romiplostim has a robust and persistent platelet response in adult patients with refractory ITP and good safety. Its effectiveness as a second-line treatment was confirmed by its age-neutral response.",

    "Abstract": "Frequent power outages represent a significant barrier to operational efficiency in the South African mining sector, and this is largely due to the country's dependence on coal-fired power stations. These disruptions have significantly impacted mining operations, making the exploration of alternative energy sources imperative to ensure continuous and unhindered production. This paper explores optimization and integration of renewable energy systems (RES), particularly solar photovoltaic (PV) systems for mining dewatering operations energy supply. Using a Mining Company as a case study, a 2.4 MW solar PV system combined with a 7.5 MWh battery storage was simulated and optimized in MATLAB to assess its technical and economic feasibility. Results show that the hybrid PV–battery system can supply approximately 5.4 GWh of renewable energy annually, achieving a 54% reduction in grid electricity consumption and avoiding about 5,076 tonnes of CO₂ emissions per year. The system’s Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) was estimated at 0.05 USD/kWh (≈ R0.95/kWh), substantially below Eskom’s industrial tariff range of R1.30–R2.00/kWh, with an expected payback period of about 11 years. These findings validate the system’s technical viability, environmental benefit, and financial attractiveness, offering a practical model for enhancing energy security, reducing emissions, and supporting sustainable mining operations in South Africa.",

Focusing on the Muko Reservoir catchment in the semi-arid Songwe Region of southwestern Tanzania, the framework integrates four widely recognised reference evapotranspiration (ET₀) models: Hargreaves-Samani, Jensen-Haise, Priestley-Taylor, and Penman. These models represent three methodological categories: temperature-based, radiation-based, and combined approaches. A 10-year dataset of monthly pan evaporation and meteorological variables was used to compare model performance through descriptive statistics, time series analysis, and correlation metrics. Results show that while all models reasonably capture seasonal evaporation patterns, significant differences exist in magnitude and variability. The Priestley-Taylor and Penman models consistently overestimated ET₀, while the Jensen-Haise model underestimated it. The Hargreaves-Samani model showed the closest agreement with observed values. The study highlights the value of a DSS-driven multi-model approach in improving evaporation estimation accuracy, especially in regions with variable data availability. The findings have significant implications for water balance modelling, reservoir operation, and climate-resilient water resource management.",

    "Abstract": "Massive open online courses (MOOCs) have received both praise and condemnation in higher education. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) debuted in 2008, and the phenomenon quickly acquired global traction. The present study aims to increase understanding of the effects of MOOCs on higher education and teachers' attitudes towards this emerging type of education by analysing existing research and data. The current study is quantitative, and the survey method of data collection was chosen due to the nature of the study and its demand. The population of the study included all higher education teachers of West Bengal. The analysis shows that there is no significant difference in male and female teachers' attitudes towards Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), nor is there a significant difference in teachers' attitudes towards Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) based on teaching experience. The major findings show that MOOCs have a positive influence on the attitude of higher education teachers.",
