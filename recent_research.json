    "Abstract": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to map and quantify recent developments in research on corporate governance and digital transformation, by emphasizing the knowledge management challenges. The study provides responses to three research questions: How has scientific production and citation impact evolved in corporate governance and digital transformation? Which authors, journals and countries form the knowledge base and collaboration networks of the field? What themes and emerging topics are shaping future research trajectories and knowledge management challenges? Design/methodology/approach A total of 112 peer-reviewed articles from Scopus were collected covering the period 2018–2025. Following the removal of duplicates and the clarification of the author/institution, a two-stage analysis was performed with Bibliometrix/Biblioshiny 5.0.1. The two stages of the analysis were as follows: (1) citation productivity and performance; (2) scientific mapping (co-citation, bibliographic coupling, co-words and thematic-evolutionary analyses). Findings The findings of the study demonstrated a significant increase in the annual scientific output, with an average growth of 42.6% being observed. A number of high-frequency keywords have been identified, including innovation, ownership, performance, governance and big data within the scope of management studies. Thematic mapping reveals four main themes: (i) environmental, social and governance (ESG)-oriented governance, (ii) digital transformation capabilities, (iii) agency cost reduction and (iv) risk-adjusted performance. A cluster in formation on artificial intelligence-based board analysis shows the highest centrality-density trajectory, signaling an emerging research frontier. Originality/value Overall, the analysis highlights the shifting focus of investors, regulators and managers towards digital disclosure of ESG information. It is suggested that boards which adopt data-driven monitoring and address knowledge management challenges via dynamic capabilities can capture innovation rents. It is incumbent upon researchers to integrate coupling-based methods to track these rapidly evolving topics and upon managers and policymakers worldwide to strategically integrate novel developments.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Enhancing aerodynamic efficiency and self-starting torque in Darrieus-type Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) is essential for power generation under low and intermittent wind conditions. This study presents a systematic evaluation of Plain Flap (PF), Gurney Flap (GF), and hybrid Plain Gurney Flap (PGF) modifications applied to the NACA 0015 aerofoil. Two-dimensional Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations using the SST k-ω model were conducted across a tip-speed-ratio (TSR) range of 0.2–4.5 and Reynolds numbers ((Re = 5.4 × 10 4 –2.7 × 10 5 ), with results validated by prototype testing. The optimal 0.5c, 10° PF configuration demonstrated the most robust and stable performance across the full operational range. At low TSR (0.2–0.5), the PF significantly improved mean Cm by 30–40% and Cp by 40% by increasing effective camber. While the 0.015c PGF generated higher instantaneous torque, it incurred larger downwind losses. At moderate TSR (0.8–1.5), PF and PGF achieved similar high Cp gains (40–50%). Beyond TSR = 2.0, the PF maintained superior aerodynamic stability and consistent efficiency, whereas the PGF performance declined due to drag penalties. Prototype testing conclusively confirmed these numerical trends, with PF blades increasing shaft speed by up to 51% at 5.5 m/s compared to the baseline. Overall, PF and PGF configurations effectively mitigate weak self-starting and low efficiency, providing a validated passive-flap design pathway for efficient small-scale and hybrid solar-wind energy systems.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background The Caenorhabditis elegans–Escherichia coli system is advantageous for studying host-microbe interactions at the single-gene level. By screening with this system, we identified that the deletion of cpxR , an E. coli transcription factor for the envelope stress response, delays C. elegans development. This finding led us to investigate how this gene regulates host development. Results We identified that E. coli Δ cpxR induced C. elegans developmental delay and activated the C. elegans mitochondrial unfolded protein response pathway through reactive oxygen species. It is widely accepted that the Cpx system is important for bacterial pathogenesis, and activating CpxR is regarded as an antimicrobial strategy. Moreover, we discovered that Δ cpxR cultured in LB medium, not cultured in M9 minimal medium, delayed C. elegans development, and the L-histidine-related metabolism of Δ cpxR contributed mostly to the difference. The metabolic fluctuations of commensal bacteria reveal that, rather than the activation of the E. coli Cpx response, the dynamic response of the E. coli Cpx system really contributes to C. elegans development. Furthermore, as the concentration of N -acetylcysteine increased, the phenotype of C. elegans fed Δ cpxR transitioned from developmental delay to survival resistance. The dynamic response is also indicated in the process in which commensal E. coli improves the stress tolerance of the host C. elegans to N -acetylcysteine. Conclusions Our results illustrate that environmental factors can shape the regulation of the E. coli Cpx response to C. elegans , providing new evidence for why Cpx-mediated virulence phenotypes are inconsistent among gram-negative species in different ecological niches.",

    "Abstract": "African swine fever (ASF) has become a global pandemic, affecting nearly 2 million pigs since 2022 alone and causing significant disruption to food security and trade. The Dominican Republic (DR) has been affected by ASF since 2021. Veterinarians are key first responders in animal health emergencies and at risk for negative impacts from prolonged emergency response. We used mixed methods and network analysis to characterize the mental and social impacts of ASF on 29 DR swine veterinarians. All 29 veterinarians were involved with the ASF response through field-based or non-field-based roles. Responses were gathered via a questionnaire and analyzed using network analysis. Preliminary quantitative results were explored further through qualitative focus group interviews. Veterinarians experienced high levels of anger and hopelessness from the ASF epidemic, which were centrally located variables in the network. They were associated with a perceived lack of communication, trust, and transparency between government authorities, veterinarians, and farmers. The impact that animal diseases have on the mental health of veterinarians is often neglected. As animal, human, and zoonotic diseases, such as ASF and avian influenza, continue to emerge and expand, these results bring attention to the need for considering actions to prevent and mitigate their impact on the mental health of first responders and, ultimately, improve the effectiveness of the response.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Herein, a novel copper-triazole derivative Schiff base nanocomplex (HIT-Cu 2+ ) was obtained via the reaction of the 3-(2-(4-amino-5-mercapto-4 H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)hydrazineylidene)indolin-2-one (HIT) Schiff base with CuCl 2 .6H 2 O. The non-ionic surfactant Triton X-114 (TX-114) was used as the extractant. The HIT, HIT-Cu 2+ , and HIT-Cu 2+ in the organic layer were characterized by several techniques, including CHNS elemental analysis, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV–Vis), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The TEM results revealed the formation of the HIT-Cu 2+ nanocomplex, with a particle size ranging from 13 to 25 nm. Moreover, an improved preconcentration method, named rapidly synergistic cloud point extraction (RS-CPE), was established for Cu 2+ preconcentration and determination to overcome the issues investigated in CPE. Decanol acted as a cloud point revulsant and synergistic reagent, lowering the cloud point temperature (CPT) of TX-114, so that CPE could be done at room temperature without heating. Compared with traditional CPE (about 30 min for heating, incubation and cooling), RS-CPE was accomplished in 1 min with considerably high extraction efficiency. The improved extraction technique, RS-CPE, was combined with ICP-OES to improve the analytical performance and expand the application of ICP-OES determination. Various parameters that influence the Cu 2+ removal efficiency (R, %) utilizing HIT Schiff base were investigated, including the solution’s pH and volume, the concentration of HIT and Cu 2+ , type of surfactant, TX-114 concentration, equilibrium temperature and time, interfering ions, and centrifugation time and rate. At optimum conditions, the Cu 2+ linear range, the correlation coefficient, the limit of detection (LOD), and the limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.5–5 µg.mL − 1 , 0.9999, 0.018, and 0.054 µg/L, respectively. The investigated RS-CPE/ICP-OES approach was applied to real water and pharmaceutical samples, achieving recoveries higher than 97% with a preconcentration factor of 125. The HIT-Cu 2+ CPE mechanism in the organic layer of TX-114 is elucidated. The greenness of the methods was evaluated using two recent methods: the Analytical Greenness (AGREE) calculator and the Blue Applicability Green Index (BAGI), which produced results in the ranges of 0.64–0.71 and 60-67.5, respectively. These results are strongly aligned with both green ideals and environmentally friendly practices. The predicted toxicity of HIT and HIT-Cu 2+ nanocomplex was evaluated using PROTOX 3 software.",

    "Abstract": "Background: High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) reduces dead-space ventilation, but this effect is diminished by open-mouth breathing and partial airway obstruction. Consequently, it is uncertain whether HFNC provides respiratory support during endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures. Methods: A single-center randomized controlled crossover study was conducted at the Rijnstate Hospital, Arnhem, the Netherlands, from November 2022 to August 2024. Patients with severe COPD (Gold III/IV) were evaluated to determine if HFNC reduces dead space ventilation during an EBUS procedure. Exclusion criteria were known neurodegenerative conditions, allergies to propofol or esketamine, pregnancy, upper-airway obstructions, or severe pulmonary hypertension. Subjects received two sequences of HFNC flow (30 and 70 L/min or vice versa) during EBUS. The primary outcome was CO 2 washout, determined by a 60-s capnography trace with and without HFNC flow to measure the difference in inspiratory, end-tidal CO 2 , and β-angle. Results: Twenty subjects with severe COPD (Gold III/IV) were included (Group A n = 10; Group B n = 10), of which one could not complete the bronchial measurements because of an obstructing carcinoma. CO 2 washout at carina was observed at 70 L/min of HFNC flow, demonstrated by a reduced inspiratory CO 2 of mean 6.0 mm Hg (95% CI: 4.5–8.3, P &lt; .001) and end-tidal CO 2 of 5.3 mm Hg (95% CI: 2.3–7.5, P = .002), but not at 30 L/min of HFNC flow (mean inspiratory CO 2 difference of 1.5 mm Hg (95% CI: −2.3 to 6.0, P = .69) and mean end-tidal CO 2 difference of 0.8 mm Hg (95% CI: −2.3 to 3.0, P = .35). A flow of 70 L/min reduced inspiratory CO 2 in the left main bronchus (mean = 5.3 mm Hg; 95% CI: 2.3–8.3, P &lt; .001), but not the end-tidal CO 2 (mean = 3.0 mm Hg; 95% CI: 0.0–6.0, P = .07). Conclusions: An HFNC flow of 70 L/min reduced dead-space ventilation in subjects with severe COPD undergoing EBUS procedures during deep sedation, suggesting respiratory support during this procedure.",

    "Abstract": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a highly infectious virus that leads to severe diarrhea and high death rates in neonatal piglets. Because PEDV primarily infects the intestinal mucosa, the induction of effective mucosal immunity through oral vaccination represents a promising strategy for disease prevention. In this study, a recombinant Lactobacillus paracasei (L. paracasei) strain expressing a multicomponent fusion antigen composed of the PEDV S1 protein, M cell- and dendritic cell-targeting peptides, and the mucosal adjuvant LTB was constructed as a candidate oral vaccine. Pregnant mice orally immunized with the recombinant strain exhibited significantly increased levels of PEDV-specific serum IgG as well as secretory IgA (SIgA) in intestinal mucus and feces, both of which showed in vitro neutralizing activity. In addition, oral immunization markedly enhanced cellular immune responses, as indicated by elevated serum levels of IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-10. Notably, newborn mice delivered by immunized dams displayed significantly higher levels of PEDV-specific SIgA, demonstrating effective maternal antibody transfer. These results indicate that the recombinant L. paracasei strain can robustly induce humoral, cellular, and mucosal immune responses and confer maternal immune protection. This study emphasizes the possibility of oral vaccinations based on L. paracasei as a viable approach to the prevention and management of epidemic diarrhea in piglets.",

    "Abstract": "In the central highlands of Odisha, India, Kutia Kondh families navigate a precarious reality shaped by productive autonomy, decentralized authority, and material and relational uncertainty. Abundance and destitution are finely balanced in a world where humans, animals, ancestors, and spirits are co‐present and co‐dependent but also opaque and unpredictable. A significant amount of ‘tact’ is therefore required to create enduring links of mutuality whilst also respecting the autonomy of the parties involved. Tactful action appears at multiple scales: everyday relational negotiations, shamanic dialogues, and ritual sacrifice are attempts to bring the uncertainty and heterogeneity of life into some kind of temporary orbit. These tactful elicitations of mutuality are a way to manage the difficult dead, unsatiated spirits, and uncanny therianthropes – nightmares of unmanaged commensuration in a situation of intense more‐than‐human mutuality. While the Kutia have a long history of ‘segmentary egalitarianism’ in regional politics, the everyday management of relational precarity in Kutia villages is opposed to any sense of equality‐as‐equivalence. Kutia families ultimately grapple with different egalitarian registers in the mutualities of upland life. Alongside egalitarian boundary work in communal relations, there is the newer civic egalitarianism of the Odisha state – an egalitarian register at a much larger scale, accompanied by new nightmares of total, tactless commensuration.",

    "Abstract": "Carbon dioxide undergoes rapid dissociation during high-speed entry into the Mars atmosphere. This process is closely related to the heat transfer on the surface of a spacecraft. A precise quantitative characterization of this nonequilibrium process is critical for accurate aerodynamic heating predictions. A [Formula: see text] tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy ([Formula: see text]-TDLAS) was developed and coupled to the previous CO-TDLAS system for simultaneous temperature, CO concentration, and [Formula: see text] concentration measurements during the [Formula: see text] dissociation process. The R(0, 88) line in the [Formula: see text] fundamental vibrational band was selected, and its absorption cross section was calibrated over 3030–5990 K. The new setup was then applied to studies of [Formula: see text] dissociation behaviors. Evident deviations were found between measurements and model predictions. Sensitivity analysis was performed to find out the key reaction impacting [Formula: see text] dissociation and to suppress the impacts of secondary reactions. The reaction rate coefficient of [Formula: see text] was updated as an Arrhenius equation over 2980–6030 K. The revised mechanism with updated rate coefficient predicts more accurate [Formula: see text] dissociation behaviors over 3000–6000 K. In addition, this study provides a functional methodology to determine the rate coefficient of a specific elementary reaction over a wide temperature range with low uncertainty.",

    "Abstract": "Age estimation is a critical aspect of forensic identification, particularly in adults, where traditional skeletal markers become less reliable. Cranial suture closure, though controversial, remains a valuable parameter, especially when population-specific standards are applied. This study aimed to assess the correlation between cranial suture closure and chronological age in the Gujarati population. A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 100 medicolegal autopsy cases (50 males, 50 females) aged 13–78 years. Suture closure was assessed using the Acsadi-Nemeskeri scoring system across 16 defined cranial segments. Both endocranial and ectocranial surfaces were examined. In this study, Sagittal sutures closed earliest (30s), followed by coronal (40s), and lambdoid (50+), with near-complete fusion by 60 years. Endocranial closure demonstrated slightly higher accuracy (85%, MAE ± 4.2 years) compared to ectocranial (81%, MAE ± 4.8 years). Correlation with age was strongest for endocranial sagittal sutures (r = 0.946). No significant gender differences were observed. The findings indicate cranial suture closure, particularly endocranial sagittal fusion, is a reliable, gender-independent method for age estimation in the Gujarati population. It is most accurate in individuals aged 30–60 years and should be incorporated into forensic protocols alongside other age indicators.",

However, there have been relatively few applications of generative adversarial networks to EEG data. To study the effect of high-order brain functional networks on schizophrenia patients, a high-order graph attention generative adversarial network prediction model is proposed, and the generator of the model utilizes graph attention networks and long short-term memory networks to capture the high-order topological features of persistence images for early diagnosis and prediction of schizophrenia patients. The research results on the five frequency bands of schizophrenia show that the proposed prediction model performs best in the Theta frequency band, with AUC and MAP values reaching 93.5% and 93.0%, respectively, and an average accuracy of 91.5%, both of which are superior to the selected comparison methods. Moreover, the image quality coefficient is used to quantify the realism and clarity of the images generated by the model. the image quality coefficients of schizophrenia patients were significantly correlated with the PANSS total scores in the Gamma and Theta bands, which provided a new idea for generative adversarial networks in the prediction of schizophrenia high-order topological features.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The solar wind at 1 AU is primarily super-Alfvénic, but rare instances occur when the Alfvén speed surpasses the solar wind speed, resulting in occurrences of sub-Alfvénic intervals. During sub-Alfvénic intervals, the solar wind no longer creates a bow shock around Earth, allowing for a direct interaction between the solar wind and Earth’s magnetopause. The thermal properties and turbulence characteristics of such rarely observed sub-Alfvénic regions at 1 AU are not well understood. Our study comprehensively investigates sub-Alfvénic intervals observed from 1995 to 2023 and identifies a total of eleven such distinct regions embedded within solar wind streams and interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). We focus on examining the thermodynamic properties of these regions by using the polytropic index and compare them with nearby super-Alfvénic regions. We find a transition in polytropic behavior from super-Alfvénic to sub-Alfvénic intervals. Interestingly, we observed a bimodal distribution in the polytropic index, characterized by two distinct states: (i) sub- to super-adiabatic (α &amp;gt; 1) and (ii) non-adiabatic (α &amp;lt; 1). The presence of a non-adiabatic state at 1 AU strongly suggests that heating dynamics is a significant factor influencing the thermodynamic state of the solar wind at this distance. We also investigated turbulence properties, and it indicates that turbulence is lower in sub-Alfvénic flow compared to neighboring super-Alfvénic regions, suggesting different processes are involved in these regions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract. The structure of the tropical upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) affects radiative balance, stability, and regional dynamics in important ways. Lack of reliable observational baselines poses a challenge to evaluating model representation of UTLS properties. Here, we use in-situ data, primarily from the StratoClim field campaign over the Asian Monsoon area, to assess the UTLS temperature, moisture, and ice clouds in the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model at storm-resolving grid spacing. We also employ superpressure balloon data and updrafts of the POSIDON and ATTREX campaigns to evaluate the UTLS convective updrafts and gravity wave activity in ICON. Our simulations show the upper troposphere is too cold, while the lower stratosphere is too warm and excessively dry relative to observations. These thermodynamic biases coincide with overestimated cloud ice in the upper troposphere and underestimated cloud ice in the lower stratosphere. The mean convective updraft is underestimated by 80 % in the model, and the power spectral density for temperature fluctuations of frequencies greater than 10−3 s−1 is underestimated by orders of magnitude. Too weak dynamics exacerbate a lack of ice cloud above 100 hPa. Too weak and too infrequent convective overshoots or too rapid dissipation of upper-tropospheric ice clouds in the model are two possible explanatory mechanisms for these biases.",

Here, we realize two- and three-site chains in semiconducting quantum dots coupled via superconductors, and tune them to the sweet spot where zero-energy Majorana modes appear at the chain ends. We demonstrate control of the superconducting phase through both magnetic field and sweet-spot selection, and fully characterize the excitation spectrum under local and global perturbations.

    "Abstract": "Thermal runaway (TR) of lithium-ion batteries caused by electrical, thermal, and mechanical abuse is a primary contributor to electric vehicle (EV) fires. To address the unclear propagation mechanisms and hazard characteristics of thermal runaway fires in full-scale EV battery packs, a comprehensive thermal runaway fire test on battery pack was conducted in this study. The experimental results revealed that TR propagated from individual cells to adjacent cells, ultimately engulfing the entire pack. The combustion dynamics of battery packs differed significantly from those of individual cells, exhibiting rapid fire escalation and complex combustion-explosion behaviors. A thermal radiation prediction model was established based on experimental data, according to the thermal radiation prediction model, the thermal radiation intensity of the battery pack at different distances can be obtained, so that the safe distance between various types of equipment and the electric vehicle can be determined, providing critical insights for designing safety distances and suppressing TR propagation in battery systems of EV.",

    "Abstract": "Among berry fruits, strawberries are known for a wide array of beneficial biological activities, including antioxidant, antihypertensive, antibacterial, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and anti-metastatic effects. The cultivar Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne (Romina) is particularly rich in bioactive constituents that may contribute to limiting DNA damage triggered by reactive oxygen species. In this study, we examined whether the methanolic extract of Romina strawberries (RE) exerted any genotoxic effect on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) across concentrations ranging from 25 to 200 μg/mL using the comet assay. No evidence of genotoxicity was detected. Subsequently, the capacity of RE to counteract oxidative DNA damage in two experimental models was assesed. When PBMCs were pretreated with RE prior to hydrogen peroxide exposure, a slight reduction in DNA damage was observed, with only the 50 μg/mL concentration producing a statistically significant protective effect. To evaluate the extract's interventional capacity, cells were treated with RE following exposure to H 2 O 2 . In this post-treatment design, RE demonstrated a clearly stronger antigenotoxic response, reducing DNA damage at all tested concentrations, with the most pronounced effects at 100, 150, and 200 μg/mL. Overall, the methanolic extract of the Romina cultivar showed notable protective activity against H 2 O 2 -induced oxidative DNA damage in vitro .",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Ultra‐high‐field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF‐MRI, B 0 &gt; 7 T) combined with contrast enhancement (CE‐MRI) offers unmatched spatial resolution, but high‐field effects limit the performance of negative contrast agents. Here, we report a ligand‐driven strategy to modulate the T 2 relaxivity ( r 2 ) of monodisperse 12 nm iron oxide‐based contrast agents synthesized by thermal decomposition. Five surface chemistries–polyacrylic acid (PAA), poly(isobutylene‐alt‐maleic anhydride) (PMA), poly(maleic anhydride‐alt‐1‐octadecene) (PMAO), citric acid (CA), and silica (SiO 2 )─ were investigated under physiological conditions and in vivo using relaxometry (1.4 T), clinical (3 T), and UHF (9.4 T) MRI, achieving up to a 333 m m − 1 s − 1 increase in r 2 . CA‐coated T 2 contrast agents exhibited record‐high r 2 values (522 m m − 1 s − 1 at 3 T; 381 m m − 1 s − 1 at 9.4 T) in spherical iron oxide MNPs within the superparamagnetic size range ( d &lt; 20 nm). Correlations of r 2 with hydrodynamic size, ζ‐potential, and coating thickness revealed that ligand chemistry–specifically hydrophilicity and anionic surface charge–dominates over physical shell dimensions in governing water accessibility and magnetic dephasing. This scalable ligand‐exchange strategy enables precise T 2 tuning at UHF, with phantom results reliably predicting in vivo UHF‐MRI performance in rat brain models, advancing the design of neuroimaging nanoprobes.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Platinum‐resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) responds poorly to platinum chemotherapy and evades immune surveillance by suppressing the cGAS‐STING pathway, leading to poor outcomes. Herein, we developed an epigenetic metal‐organic framework (MOF) nanoagonist (CMZ‐Pt‐SA@HA) that overcomes cisplatin (CisPt) resistance while restoring immune activation. The platform consists of Mn‐ZIF‐8 encapsulating CaO 2 and co‐loaded with CisPt and SAHA (a histone deacetylase inhibitor), then modified with hyaluronic acid to enable tumor targeting and controlled release. CMZ‐Pt‐SA@HA is multifunctional: SAHA downregulates resistance proteins epigenetically, CaO 2 triggers calcium overload and oxygen release, and Mn 2+ /Zn 2+ enhances oxidative stress and STING signaling, collectively strengthening chemo‐metalloimmunotherapy. These mechanisms intensify CisPt‐induced DNA damage and stimulate immune activation. CMZ‐Pt‐SA@HA applies a three‐step “POP” strategy to overcome PROC's triple defenses: (I) Pre‐targeting to enhance DNA‐CisPt adducts; (II) On‐targeting to block DNA repair; and (III) Post‐targeting to induce apoptosis by relieving hypoxia, arresting the cell cycle, damaging mitochondria, and activating cGAS‐STING. Whether used alone in subcutaneous tumors in preclinical ID8 and patient‐derived xenograft mouse models, or combined with anti‐PD‐L1 therapy in ascites metastasis models, CMZ‐Pt‐SA@HA consistently showed strong therapeutic efficacy. Its Mn 2+ ‐based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) capability further supports image‐guided therapy and clinical translation.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs) are rare malignancies with limited treatment options beyond surgery, particularly in advanced stages, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic strategies. Featured by pronounced biologic heterogeneity, PNETs are driven by dysregulation of complex molecular-signaling pathways during tumor progression. This underscores the importance of biologically relevant and cost-effective preclinical models that allow convenient real-time monitoring of tumor progression and tracking of individual tumor cells, a current gap in the field. Methods To address this challenge, the authors engineered a novel enteroendocrine tumor-derived STC-1 murine cell line that stably co-expresses firefly luciferase (F-Luc) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). These dual-labeled cells were implanted into immunocompromised mice via three different routes: subcutaneous (SubQ), renal capsule (RC), and orthotopic pancreatic (OP) injections. Tumor growth was tracked using bioluminescence in vivo imaging, and PNET characteristics were assessed by histologic, immunohistochemical (IHC) and co-immunofluorescence analyses. Results Tumors formed in all three models. The SubQ model showed rapid tumor growth but lacked key PNET features based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and IHC staining. The RC model exhibited moderate growth but limited expression of PNET-specific markers. In contrast, the OP model demonstrated robust tumor growth and most closely resembled well-differentiated, grade 1 human PNETs. Lineage-tracing experiments further exhibited clonal architecture and dynamic progression within the OP model. Conclusions Orthotopic pancreatic implantation of dual-labeled STC-1 cells provides a biologically relevant and pragmatic preclinical platform that closely resembles human PNETs. This model offers valuable utility for investigating PNET biology and evaluating novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "Abstract": "The increasing frequency of interior renovation and fit-out in office buildings raises concerns about indoor environmental quality, occupant health, and sustainability performance, yet existing certification systems remain largely design-stage or whole-building oriented and provide limited guidance for recurring renovation cycles. This study develops a health-oriented assessment framework for office interior renovation as a structured decision-support tool for practitioners and policymakers. We adopted an integrated approach combining a targeted literature review, expert consultation, the Fuzzy Delphi Method (FDM) for indicator screening, and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for hierarchical weighting, based on an expert panel of 20 professionals spanning green building certification, architecture/interior design, MEP engineering, property/facility management, and energy/environmental consulting. Through consensus screening and weighting, four assessment dimensions and eighteen key indicators were identified and prioritized. Environmental quality was ranked highest (39.2%), followed by safety management (23.0%), functional usability (21.1%), and resource efficiency and circularity (16.7%). At the indicator level, indoor air quality management, Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) energy efficiency, space-friendly layout, preliminary assessment and planning, and thermal comfort emerged as the top priorities. Overall, the framework bridges the gap between certification-oriented evaluation and the operational realities of office renovation, enabling more consistent integration of health and sustainability considerations across renovation decision-making.",

    "Abstract": "Myocardial infarction (MI) triggers complex pathological processes, including inflammation, hypoxia, and fibrotic remodeling. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as promising biomarkers for cardiovascular injury; however, their expression dynamics along processes remain underexplored. We used an in vivo rat model of permanent coronary occlusion to study the molecular alterations associated with MI and its resolution in a temporal mode, including five experimental groups with five animals in each: sham, PO 24 h, PO 72 h, PO 7 d, PO 1 month. Histological analysis, serum biomarkers, and miRNA/gene expression profiles were analyzed in a time-dependent manner post-occlusion. Subsequent analysis revealed early depletion of selected circulating miRNAs (PO 24 h). Transient upregulation in cardiac tissue miRNAs, inflammatory and fibrotic gene expression (Fibronectin, Collagen, Vimentin, E-Cadherin) were observed at PO 72 h. These molecular alterations correlated with histological evidence of myocardial injury and repair. Taken together, our findings delineate the molecular timeline of MI progression and resolution and identify candidate miRNAs as sensitive and time-dependent indicators of myocardial stress, including miR-107, miR-122-5p and miR-221-3p. This integrative approach supports the use of miRNA signatures for noninvasive monitoring of cardiac injury and resolution and unveils potential therapeutic targets to reduce pathological remodeling.",

HRV data was collected over a five-minute interval, focusing on frequency domain parameters including total power, very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and the LF/HF ratio. The bronchiectasis group exhibited a significantly elevated LF/HF ratio, indicating a shift in cardiac sympathovagal balance, relative to the control group (2.25 ± 0.39 vs. 2.05 ± 0.38; p = 0.006). Additionally, marked differences were found in specific frequency domain parameters: LF (2.33 ± 0.55 vs. 2.55 ± 0.46; p = 0.021) and HF (2.06 ± 0.75 vs. 2.5 ± 0.56; p = 0.001).

    "Abstract": "The pursuit of sustainable ammonia production has accelerated the development of electrocatalytic pathways capable of operating under ambient conditions with renewable electricity. Recent studies have revealed that the efficiency and selectivity of both electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (eNRR) and nitrate reduction reaction (eNO3RR) are not governed solely by catalyst composition, but by the synergistic interplay among electrolyte identity, interfacial solvation structure, and catalyst architecture. Hydrated cations such as Li+ profoundly reshape the electric double layer, polarize interfacial water, and lower activation barriers for key proton–electron transfer steps, thereby redefining the electrolyte as an active promoter. Parallel advances in structural engineering, including alloying, heteroatom doping, controlled defect formation, and nanoscale morphological control, have enabled the optimization of intermediate adsorption energies while simultaneously suppressing competing hydrogen evolution. In addition, the emergence of metal–organic-framework (MOF)-derived single-atom catalysts has demonstrated that atomically dispersed transition-metal centers anchored within dynamically adaptable matrices can deliver exceptional Faradaic efficiencies, high turnover rates, and long-term operational durability. These developments highlight a unified strategy in which electrolyte–catalyst coupling, rational structural modification, and atomic-scale design principles converge to enable predictable and high-performance ammonia electrosynthesis. This review integrates mechanistic insights across these domains and outlines future directions for translating molecular-level understanding into scalable technologies for green ammonia production.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Critical‐sized maxillofacial bone defects remain a major clinical challenge due to the limited osteoinductive capacity of existing biomaterials. While cell adhesion is recognized as an initiating event in bone regeneration, how adhesive interactions integrate biochemical and mechanical cues to regulate osteogenic commitment remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the synergistic coupling of mechanical stimulation (MS) and icariin (ICA) promotes osteogenic differentiation through the integrin β 1 /β‐actin/YAP signaling axis. By combining single‐cell adhesion force measurements using a robotic micro‐operating system with biomimetic three‐dimensional scaffolds, we show that MS‐ICA coupling enhances osteoblast adhesion, induces actin cytoskeletal remodeling, and facilitates YAP nuclear translocation, thereby activating osteogenic gene expression. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of integrin β 1 , β‐actin, or YAP abrogated the pro‐osteogenic effects, confirming their essential roles in this mechanotransductive pathway. In a rabbit mandibular defect model, ICA‐functionalized scaffolds under physiological loading significantly accelerated bone regeneration. Collectively, these results elucidate a mechanistic link between cell adhesion and lineage specification and establish a design principle for biomaterials that integrate mechanical and biochemical regulation to enhance bone regeneration.",

    "Abstract": "The G protein-coupled galanin receptors include three different subtypes: galanin receptor 1, 2 and 3 (GalR1, GalR2, GalR3). The neuropeptide galanin is the principal natural agonist of the galanin receptors, the so-called galaninergic system. Galanin-like peptide and spexin have also been identified as natural ligands of the galanin receptors. Galanin receptors are widely expressed in the brain; however, they can be found in other tissues, such as the skeletal muscle, the heart, and the gastrointestinal tract. The galaninergic system regulates diverse biological processes, including feeding behavior, neuroprotection, learning, memory, cardiovascular and renal function, and nociception. Its dysregulation is associated with various diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes mellitus, epilepsy, depression, and cancer. The stimulation of GalR1 and GalR3 leads to the Gαi/o-type G protein-mediated inhibition of cyclic AMP/protein kinase A, whereas GalR2 stimulation initiates phospholipase C activation via Gαq/11-type G proteins. A galanin-activated β-arrestin-dependent pathway has also been described for GalR2. In this review, we summarize the recent advances concerning galanin receptor signaling, including both the G protein-dependent and -independent pathways. A better understanding of the complex interplay of the signaling molecules, receptors, and various signaling pathways is crucial for the future development of specific agonists with therapeutic potential.",

    "Abstract": "In Louisiana’s marsh creation projects designed to mitigate wetland loss, riverine sediments are hydraulically dredged and transported through pipelines. These dredged materials are extremely soft, with moisture contents well above 100%, resulting in significant consolidation settlements even under minimal self-weight loads. Conventional one-dimensional (1-D) oedometer consolidation tests are commonly used to assess consolidation behavior; however, they are limited to soils with much lower moisture contents. At higher moisture levels, the soft slurry tends to overflow due to the weight of the standard stainless-steel dial cap and porous stone, which together apply a seating pressure of 1.07 kPa (0.01 TSF). This study presents a modified oedometer setup utilizing 3D-printed dial caps made from lightweight materials such as polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), reducing the seating pressure to 0.21 kPa (0.002 TSF). This modification enables the testing of dredged soils with moisture contents up to 100% without overflow. Settling column tests were also integrated with the modified oedometer tests, allowing for the development of void ratio–effective stress relationships spanning from 0.02 kPa (0.0002 TSF) to 107.25 kPa (1 TSF). The results demonstrate that combining settling column and modified oedometer tests provides an effective approach for evaluating the consolidation behavior of high-moisture slurry soils.",

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) represents a common comorbidity with AUD which worsens outcomes and decreases functional outcomes. Suvorexant (SUV) shows clear promise as a novel therapeutic candidate to treat AUD and PTSD. Methods This study features a promising compound (i.e., suvorexant), the application of a well-established human laboratory paradigm (i.e., alcohol cue reactivity), and a novel early efficacy laboratory model (i.e., practice quit attempt) to provide a cost/time-efficient evaluation of safety and initial efficacy of suvorexant for AUD with comorbid PTSD. Additionally, by collecting both objective and subjective sleep measures, the study provides an assessment of a putative mechanism through which suvorexant jointly addresses an intervening variable common to both AUD and PTSD. Discussion The combination of human laboratory modeling and real-world clinical outcomes provides a unique and synergistic set of data that can advance the development of suvorexant and identify its behavioral mechanisms of action. The recruitment of individuals with AUD and PTSD with sleep disturbances and who are intrinsically motivated to quit is a novel approach to screening pharmacotherapies by bridging the gap between experimental studies with non-treatment seekers and clinical trials with treatment-seeking individuals.

    "Abstract": "Fast-spiking, non-adaptive inhibitory neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) critically gate the reciprocal communication between the thalamus and the cortex. Parvalbumin (PV) neurons express high levels of PV, the sole role of which appears to be calcium buffering. The significance of the PV protein – and its related high calcium-buffering capacity - under pathological conditions, especially in various neuropsychiatric disorders, is underappreciated. Deficiency of SHANK3, an important neuronal protein containing ankyrin, SH3, and PDZ, three canonical domains for protein recognition, causes behavioral changes relevant to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Here we report TRN PV neurons of Shank3-/- (exon 4-22 deletion) mice of either sex exhibit pronounced increases in burst firing occurrence, decreased tonic firing frequency, and faster dendritic calcium transient decay. We pinpointed reduced PV expression as the culprit and used the added-buffer approach to confirm the decrease in calcium-buffering capacity in mutant neurons. Conversely, supplementing Shank3-/- PV neurons with extra EGTA reversed the abnormal action potential (AP) firing. In addition, the PV neurons from HCN2-/- mice exhibit consistent changes in neuronal excitability, PV expression, and calcium signaling. Together with the study of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), these results uncover reduced PV expression, calcium-buffering capacity, and altered neuronal excitability in Shank3-/- and HCN2-/- mice. This pathway, downstream of Shank3 deficiency and HCN channelopathy, may form an important pathological basis not only for ASD but also other neuropsychiatric disorders. Significance Statement SHANK3 is a scaffolding protein that is highly enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of synapses. Mutations and deletions of the SHANK3 gene are directly connected to Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS) and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). However, the links between genetic alterations and abnormalities at the cellular, network, and behavioral levels remain unclear. This study uncovered abnormal physiological changes in inhibitory neurons in the thalamus. A definitive link at the cellular level is established between the Shank3 protein deficiency and the pathological basis of related neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Scholars have proposed integrating deliberative democracy processes and new technologies within party structures to address the legitimacy crisis of political parties. However, for established political groups, this is not an easy road to take. The paper delves into these issues by presenting the case study of Agorà Democratiche within the Italian Democratic Party (PD), the major center-left party in Italy. Agorà aimed to engage party members and like-minded citizens in shaping the party’s agenda through deliberative assemblies. This adoption by Agorà introduced a new form of political participation that led thousands of citizens to voice their opinions. However, it encountered several challenges. The paper argues that democratic innovations do not always yield the desired outcomes for political parties. Participatory and deliberative processes might be hard to implement in established political groups that are accustomed to old political schemas. More specifically, I pinpoint four main obstacles encountered by Agorà Democratiche: the ‘culture of verticality’ within the party, an unfavorable external context, the lack of institutionalization of the programme, and the ambiguous role played by technology. If not handled carefully, new technologies and deliberative processes can worsen the existing crisis within political parties by falling short of expectations and further undermining the organization’s credibility.",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between palate morphology, masticatory muscle thickness, choanae structure, and sphenoidale foramina in individuals with temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD), and to determine how variations in these parameters affect temporomandibular joint (TMJ) function. Methods: Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans of 36 individuals with TMD and 36 healthy controls, aged 18 to 69 years, were retrospectively analyzed. The possible relationships between TMD and the morphometry of the hard palate, nasi choanae, and sphenoidale foramina were evaluated, and thickness measurements of the masticatory muscles (masseter, temporalis, lateral, and medial pterygoideus) were also correlated with TMD. Results: Significant relationships were found between TMD and the morphometric features of the craniofacial structures. Statistically significant relationships were found between age and the masseter, temporalis, and medial pterygoid muscle thicknesses in individuals who had TMD ( P &lt;0.05). In addition, a significant difference was observed in the hard palate transverse width according to gender in the TMD group ( P &lt;0.05). In the control group, a significant relationship was found between medial pterygoid thickness on both sides and left foramen ovale length and hard palate transverse width values depending on gender ( P &lt;0.05). Significant differences were found in foramen rotundum width measurements in the comparison of the TMD and control groups ( P &lt;0.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the relationship between craniofacial morphology, masticatory muscle thickness, and TMD. The findings suggest that anatomic features of the hard palate and sphenoid region may contribute to TMJ function and deepen the understanding of TMD’s structural basis.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a noncancerous prostate enlargement that significantly impacts the quality of life in aged men. Both oxidative stress and inflammation interplay to induce hyperplasia of prostatic epithelial cells as well as seminal vesicle tissues. Dihydromyricetin (DHM), extracted from Ampelopsis grossedentata , is used in traditional Chinese medicine for hundreds of years. It exhibited prominent anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities in several models. To date, its potential protective effects for BPH have not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of DHM in the management of testosterone-induced proliferation in prostate and seminal vesicle tissues. Male Wistar rats (200 to 250 g) were divided into three groups: a control group receiving sesame oil (the vehicle), a BPH group receiving testosterone oenanthate (3 mg/kg, subcutaneously) daily for 4 weeks to induce hyperplasia, and a DHM group receiving DHM (50 mg/kg) alongside testosterone oenanthate (3 mg/kg). DHM significantly reduced the prostate and seminal vesicle weights, ameliorated the histopathological changes induced by testosterone, and nearly normalized the serum testosterone, FSH, and LH levels. It also reduced the serum PSA level. Further, DHM reduced MDA levels while increasing GSH levels. Besides, it reduced the prostatic levels of 5-alpha reductase and attenuated TGF-β1/Smad-2 pathway. The anti-hyperproliferation and the anti-inflammatory effects of DHM were attributed to the attenuation of the expression of PCNA, procaspase-3, iNOS, TLR-4, and IL-1β in both the prostate and seminal vesicle tissues. DHM has potential protective effects against testosterone-induced BPH model via downregulation of inflammatory mediators, restoration of oxidative balance, and induction of cell apoptosis.

    "Abstract": "The recirculation zone is critical for flame stabilization in combustion processes, yet a quantitative, mechanistic understanding of its inherently complex mixing state remains a challenge. To address this gap, we introduce a novel characteristic parameter, the characteristic mixture fraction ( $Z_u$ ), defined from the observation of localized mixture uniformity within the zone. Using validated large-eddy simulation combined with the flamelet/progress-variable approach, we systematically examine the relationship between $Z_u$ and the momentum flux ratio ( $J$ ). The results reveal that a dual-power-law scaling relationship between $Z_u$ and $J$ is a fundamental characteristic of bluff-body stabilized flows, persisting with and without chemical reactions. This scaling, however, is profoundly modified by combustion. Compared with non-reacting flows, reacting flows exhibit a shift in the transition point between power-law regimes to a higher $J$ and a shallower scaling exponent (e.g. approximately −0.15 for reacting versus −0.5 for non-reacting flows in the jet-envelopment regime). These quantitative distinctions are decisively attributed to thermophysical effects induced by heat release, interpreted through two synergistic mechanisms: at the macroscale, thermal expansion reduces density, weakening the recirculation zone’s momentum resistance; at the microscale, increased viscosity suppresses turbulent mixing efficiency. Thus, a predictive mechanistic framework centred on the parameter $Z_u$ is established, providing not only a robust metric for quantifying complex mixing states but also fundamental insights into how heat release acts on turbulent mixing. Consequently, it offers new perspectives for combustor optimization and understanding of complex mixing–combustion coupling.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The deployment of fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks is transforming digital connectivity through ultra-low latency, high data rates, and massive device support. However, enabling technologies such as network slicing, virtualization, edge computing, and dense Internet of Things (IoT) integration significantly expand the attack surface, necessitating advanced cybersecurity strategies. This study proposes a comprehensive multi-layered cybersecurity framework tailored for 5G infrastructures. The framework incorporates device-level trust validation, secure network slice configuration and isolation, dynamic policy enforcement at the orchestration layer, and AI-driven threat detection to provide end-to-end protection across the 5G architecture. Unlike traditional reactive security models, the proposed approach adopts security-by-design principles to proactively mitigate threats. The framework’s effectiveness is evaluated through extensive simulations and benchmarking against established standards, including the NIST Zero Trust Architecture and 3GPP TS 33.501. Results demonstrate a threat detection rate of up to 97.6%, low-latency performance under high-load and adversarial conditions, and scalable operation with large-scale device connectivity. Despite these results, challenges remain in ensuring consistent policy enforcement across distributed edge nodes, achieving interoperability among heterogeneous devices, and balancing performance with stringent security requirements. The study concludes by highlighting future research directions, including quantum-resilient cryptography and self-healing, AI-enhanced security mechanisms, to address evolving threats in future 6G networks.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Groups are inherently dynamic social entities whose function, adaptation, and outcomes are fundamentally driven by continuous changes in individual membership and affiliation patterns. Existing analytical frameworks often treat the group as the primary unit of analysis, overlooking the complexity of individual trajectories within these shifting structures. To address this gap, we introduce a unified, granular framework that shifts the unit of analysis from the group to the individual, formally representing their presence across multiple groups over time. Building on this formalization, we define a comprehensive set of individual-level and affiliation-level metrics to quantify the dynamics of participation. We validate the framework using three real-world datasets from distinct domains: online gaming (Travian) and professional sports (Football and NBA). The empirical results demonstrate the framework’s flexibility and explanatory power, revealing generalizable structural regularities. This framework provides a robust quantitative tool for characterizing and predicting individual behavior within dynamic group systems.",

    "Abstract": "This paper proposes the PGD model for UAV path planning in complex terrain, addressing key challenges such as high-dimensional state processing, blind path exploration, and poor cross-scene adaptability. The PGD model integrates Transformer, GAN, and DDPG, forming a “compression-generation-optimization\" closed-loop system. The Transformer module compresses high-dimensional terrain data, alleviating training bottlenecks, while the GAN module generates high-quality candidate paths, reducing ineffective exploration. DDPG then optimizes the path planning strategy efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of PGD on the UAVDT (suburban) and AirSim (canyon) datasets. In terms of path length ( P l ), PGD achieves 20.0m/22.0m, compared to baseline models such as PPO-DRL (23.8m) and Soft Actor-Critic (24.0m). PGD also outperforms in collision rate ( C r ) with 2.5%/3.0% and computational efficiency ( T c ) with 13.5s/16.0s, respectively. The PGD model shows significant improvements in path planning efficiency and adaptability, particularly in high-complexity terrains. Compared to traditional models, PGD’s multi-module synergy enhances feature correlation and physical path constraints, offering a novel framework for intelligent planning in complex environments. Future work will focus on enhancing model adaptability to extreme weather and multi-agent collaborative scenarios.",

    "Abstract": "The cerium iso-structural phase transition (γ–α) is dominated by f-electron localization changes that results in a magnetic ordering change and a volume collapse. Generally, these physics are difficult to capture with ab initio and first principles methods. However, previous works have shown various methods to be successful in predicting at least some of the physics of the γ to α phase transition. Therefore, here, we perform a broad survey of density functional based methods across three levels of theory and types of functions [GGA (generalized gradient approximation), MetaGGA, and hybrid functionals] and compare the results, focusing on hydrostatic compression across the phase boundary at zero kelvin. For the methods that best reproduce experimental results, we directly probe the predicted mechanisms and frame the results in the Mott/Kondo debate, assessing how the underlying methods and assumptions of different functionals can assess the physical drivers in the phase transition, providing insight into the governing processes of this unique phase transition.",

    "Abstract": "The H2IOSC project aims to establish a federated cluster of European distributed research infrastructures involved in the humanities and cultural heritage sectors, with operating nodes across Italy. Through four key RIs—DARIAH-IT, CLARIN, OPERAS, and E-RIHS—the project promotes collaboration among researchers with interdisciplinary expertise. Within this framework, DIGILAB functions as the digital access platform for the Italian node of E-RIHS. Conceived as a socio-technical infrastructure for the Heritage Science community, DIGILAB is designed to manage heterogeneous data and metadata through advanced knowledge graph representations. The platform adheres to the FAIR principles and supports the complete data lifecycle, enabling the development and maintenance of Heritage Digital Twins. DIGILAB integrates diverse categories of information related to cultural sites and objects, encompassing historical and artistic datasets, diagnostic analyses, 3D models, and real-time monitoring data. This monitoring capability is achieved through the deployment of cutting-edge Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). As part of DIGILAB, we developed SENNSE (v1.0), a fully open hardware/software platform dedicated to environmental and structural monitoring. SENNSE allows the remote, real-time observation and control of cultural heritage sites (collecting microclimatic parameters such as temperature, humidity, noise levels) and of cultural objects (collecting object-specific data including vibrations, light intensity, and ultraviolet radiation). The visualization and analytical tools integrated within SENNSE transform these datasets into actionable insights, thereby supporting advanced research and conservation strategies within the Cultural Heritage domain. In the following sections, we provide a detailed description of the SENNSE platform, outlining its hardware components and software modules, and discussing its benefits. Furthermore, we illustrate its application through two representative use cases: one conducted in a controlled laboratory environment and another implemented in a real-world heritage context, exemplified by the “Biblioteca Bernardini” in Lecce, Italy.",

    "Abstract": "This study proposes a novel GPS-based methodology for Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) estimation to overcome limitations of fixed detectors and inaccurate penetration rate assumptions. The approach dynamically identifies stop-line positions using spatiotemporal floating car data, calculates maximum queue lengths per signal cycle by combining floating car positions with estimated arriving vehicle lengths, and establishes a speed-based nonlinear model to determine queuing vehicle counts. A dynamic scaling coefficient derived from maximum queue lengths enables assumption-free estimation of total regional vehicles when applied to the floating car population. Validation using Chengdu data demonstrates significant improvements: unary cubic curves achieve optimal fitting for MFD relationships (R 2 up to 0.9157); the HMM-CRF hybrid map-matching algorithm reduces average position error by 29% and intersection mismatch rate by approximately 40%; simulation results show queue length estimation accuracy of RMSE 22.8m and MAPE 18.5%, while MFD estimation error for maximum network flow drops from −17.5% to −3.5%, representing an 80% relative accuracy improvement. The proposed methodology provides robust technical support for urban road network assessment and management by enabling high-precision acquisition of MFDs from floating car data, effectively addressing critical challenges in macroscopic traffic modeling and monitoring. This advancement presents potential value for perimeter control applications and other MFD-based traffic management strategies.",

    "Abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Although evidence supports the use of point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) in many clinical settings, pediatricians have not widely adopted POCUS. Our objective is to illustrate the impact of POCUS within a children’s hospital by describing a registry of cases in which POCUS guided or changed management. METHODS This is an observational study of a pediatric POCUS registry in an academic children’s hospital. Patient cases were included if POCUS guided or changed diagnostic or procedural management. Cases were identified by the physicians performing the examination, and encounters were separately reviewed. We summarize characteristics of POCUS encounters, including our categorization of diagnostic or procedural changes made as a result. RESULTS We identified 66 patients (median age, 5.5 years [interquartile range, 1–15]) who had 76 POCUS encounters during which ultrasonography changed management or guided a procedure. There were 31 diagnostic POCUS encounters performed on 29 patients. Diagnostic POCUS encounters led to a change in primary diagnosis (48%), changed disposition by facilitating or preventing discharge or transfer to higher levels of care (36%), prompted a procedure (29%), expedited specialist consultation (26%), or obviated additional imaging (19%). There were 45 procedural POCUS encounters performed on 37 patients. Procedural POCUS led to salvaged procedures (49%), prevented placement of unnecessary central venous catheters (16%), and avoided unnecessary procedures (4%). CONCLUSIONS This study describes the impact of POCUS in the care of patients in a children’s hospital. Our results may serve as an impetus for further study, training, and adoption of POCUS within hospital pediatrics.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT This study reexamines the position and policies of the Republic of China (ROC, Taiwan) towards the Ryukyus in the period from the 1943 Cairo Conference to the 1971 Okinawa Reversion Agreement. In order to do so, this research focuses on international politics and domestic society to look for determinants of shifts in the ROC position. The results show that the ROC position towards the Ryukyus was shifted between passive and assertive positions, mainly depending on external factors. The study identifies four decisive factors defining ROC positions and policy: (1) the international status of the ROC government; (2) the ROC policy of military recovery of mainland China; (3) the focus in the international sphere on the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu/Diaoyutai) sovereignty dispute; and (4) Taiwan's domestic popular opinion. Finally, the paper identifies factors that help explain the shift in the ROC position towards the sovereignty of the Ryukyus. This paper has shown that ROC policy tended to be more assertive when the international status of the ROC was stable, when the policy of military recovery of the mainland was in question, when the international focus on the Senkakus (Diaoyu/Diaoyutai) sovereignty dispute was low, and when ROC domestic public opinion on the issue was strong. Conversely, under conditions of instability in the ROC's international status, strong support for the recovery of the mainland policy, spikes in the Senkakus (Diaoyu/Diaoyutai) controversy in the international sphere, and domestic weak public interest in the issue, policy tended to become passive.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: Conjoint fascial sheath suspension is an effective treatment for severe congenital ptosis, but its application in young children remains debated. This study refined the technique and compared outcomes between children and adults to clarify the optimal age for its use. Methods: Patients with severe congenital ptosis and poor levator function (≤4 mm) were grouped by age: preschool (3–6 years), school-aged (7–17 years), and adult (&gt;18 years). All underwent refined conjoint fascial sheath suspension surgery and were followed for 3 years. Outcomes were compared across groups. Levator aponeurosis complex samples were analyzed histologically to evaluate collagen fiber, smooth muscle, and skeletal muscle content and assess developmental differences between children and adults. Results: Data were collected from 39 patients (50 eyes): 14 (18 eyes) in the preschool group, 15 (20 eyes) in the school-aged group, and 10 (12 eyes) in the adult group. All groups showed significant improvements in palpebral fissure height and margin reflex distance 1 ( P &lt;0.05). No significant intergroup differences were observed in palpebral fissure height change, correction rate, recurrence rate, or scleral exposure during follow-up (P&gt;0.05). Smooth muscle, collagen fiber, and skeletal muscle content in the levator complex did not vary by age ( P &gt;0.05). No complications, including trichiasis or conjunctival prolapse, occurred.

    "Abstract": "Abstract Congenital upper limb anomalies (CULA) are common, but the actual magnitude of the problem within the community remains undetermined due to a lack of a registry system. Our study aimed to determine the epidemiology of CULA, its syndromic associations with other systems, to identify and categorize upper limb anomalies according to the International Federation of Societies for Surgery of the Hand (IFSSH) classification, to study the inheritance pattern of the disease, and to investigate the association of risk factors during the antenatal period. This ambispective study was conducted at a tertiary care center from January 2022 to July 2024. Exclusion criteria included stillbirths, vascular malformations, congenital peripheral nerve disorders, and birth brachial plexus injuries. Comprehensive demographics, antenatal, perinatal, and postnatal histories, as well as family pedigrees, were documented. Each CULA case was classified according to the IFSSH guidelines, and statistical analysis was performed using Stata 18.0. There were 148 cases, with 5 dropouts, with a mean age of presentation being approximately 7 years, with approximately 58% males and approximately 42% females. The ratio of bilateral:right:left was 3.8:1.7:1. The most common non-hand involvement was in the foot, with the ratio of bilateral:right:left being 13.4:4.5:1. The mean birth weight was 2.75 kg, and the mothers' mean age at the time of birth was 26 years. There were three cases born to a consanguineously married couple, and four cases were detected on ultrasonography, with no significant correlation. There was positive familial correlation in IFSSH II, III, and VI categories, with p-values of 0.037, 0.001, and 0.026, respectively. The most common occurrence was seen in the IFSSH II category (98 cases) and the least in the IFSSH VI category (7 cases). A substantial gap exists in the literature regarding the epidemiology and registry systems for CULA, rendering the full extent of the issue within communities ambiguous. However, IFSSH II is the most common anomaly with a varying pattern. Positive family history is commonly observed in IFSSH II, III, and VI groups, and syndromic associations are more prevalent in groups I and VII.",

Several lines of reasoning, however, suggest that such compositional change, called temporal species turnover, can similarly result from intrinsic ecosystem dynamics, even in a constant environment. The degree to which these two drivers contribute to observed turnover remains unclear. To address this conundrum, we analyse the well-established BioTIME database of surveys. We expect either an acceleration of turnover with accelerating climate change or constant turnover if intrinsic mechanisms dominate. Surprisingly we find instead that species turnover over short time intervals (1-5 years) has decelerated in significantly more communities during the last 100 years than it has accelerated, typically by one third. The observed slowing of turnover, we argue, could be understood—when intrinsic dynamics dominate—as resulting because anthropogenic environmental degradation or declines of regional species pools reduce the number of potential colonisers driving turnover. Our results suggest that observed past changes in species composition were often manifestations of natural, intrinsic ecosystem dynamics. Although one can expect environmental drivers to dominate species turnover eventually as climate change accelerates further, for now such attribution should be done with caution.",

    "Abstract": "Accurate characterization of river channel geometry is essential for hydrological and hydraulic analyses, yet the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry introduces challenges related to uneven point density, shadow-induced data gaps, and spurious outliers. This study proposed a novel approach for reconstructing 3D river channels from UAV-derived point clouds, emphasizing K-nearest neighbor local regression (KLR), and compared it with the LOWESS model. Method performance was examined through controlled simulations of trapezoidal, triangular, and U-shaped synthetic channels, where KLR consistently preserved morphological fidelity and produced lower RMSE than LOWESS, particularly at channel bends and bed undulations, while a neighborhood selection heuristic approach demonstrated robust results across varying data densities. Synthetic channel experiments show that the proposed K-nearest-neighbor local linear regression (KLR) method achieves RMSE values below 0.06 all tested geometries. In contrast, LOWESS produces substantially larger errors, with RMSE values exceeding 0.9 across all channel shapes. Subsequent application to two South Korean field sites reinforced these findings. In the data-scarce Migok-cheon stream, KLR effectively interpolated missing surfaces while maintaining geomorphic realism, whereas LOWESS generated over-smoothed representations. Within the dense Ogsan Bridge dataset, KLR retained small-scale bed features critical for hydraulic simulations and cross-sectional delineation, while LOWESS obscured local variability. Conclusively, the results demonstrate that KLR provides a more reliable and computationally efficient framework for UAV-based 3D river channel reconstruction, with clear implications for hydraulic modeling, flood risk management, and the advancement of digital-twin systems in operational hydrology.",

    "Abstract": "The tardigrade Ramazzottius varieornatus exhibits extraordinary resilience to extreme environmental stresses, yet the functional diversity of its proteome remains largely unexplored. In this study, the structural and biochemical characterization of RvCA5, an atypical α-carbonic anhydrase (CA) identified in R. varieornatus, is presented. Expression analysis in E. coli revealed the spontaneous formation of a truncated RvCA5 species, which was confirmed to be unrelated to signal peptide cleavage. RvCA5 exhibited distinct structural features, including extended intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) at both termini. Unlike canonical α-CAs, RvCA5 exhibited negligible CO2 hydration activity, which was partially enhanced by the removal of the N-terminal IDR, suggesting that this region acts as a dynamic entropic barrier hindering substrate diffusion. RvCA5 possesses multiple surface-exposed reactive cysteine residues, resembling the redox-sensing human CA 3. Notably, consistent with a predicted nuclear localization signal, in silico modeling predicted that RvCA5 can bind DNA via a positively charged patch near the C-terminal IDR. The DNA-binding capability of RvCA5 was experimentally demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Collectively, these findings suggest that RvCA5 potentially functions as a redox-responsive transcriptional regulator.",

    "Abstract": "As global climate change intensifies and the Paris Agreement advances low-carbon transformation, frequent local policy adjustments under China’s dual carbon goals have made climate-policy uncertainty a core challenge for corporate sustainability. Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance has grown exponentially in international capital markets, evolving from a peripheral concept to a key investment decision-making dimension. This study uses China’s carbon peaking and neutrality policies as a quasinatural experiment, applying the difference-in-differences (DID) method to the panel data of Chinese A-share listed companies (2014–2023). Taking high-energy-consuming enterprises as the treatment group, this study identifies net policy effects via the interaction of policy and time dummy variables. The results show that carbon peaking and neutrality policies significantly suppress the ESG performance of energy-intensive firms; mediating effect tests confirm that the policy harms ESG performance by increasing uncertainty. Implications include enhancing policy transparency and predictability and optimizing resource allocation to strengthen ESG resilience. Future research should focus on micro-level policy indicators and long-term effect tracking to provide theoretical and practical support for synergizing dual carbon goals with high-quality economic development.",

    "Abstract": "Participatory decision-making (PDM) is increasingly recognized as a critical governance mechanism for enhancing institutional sustainability in higher education. However, the internal pathways through which participation contributes to organizational learning and adaptive governance remain insufficiently understood and empirically tested. Drawing on collaborative governance and organizational learning theories, this study develops a feedback-based governance framework that links PDM, learning feedback (LF), and adaptive governance capacity within universities. This study adopts a quantitative research design and employs covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) to examine the proposed framework. The analytical strategy integrates confirmatory factor analysis, mediation analysis, moderation analysis, and multi-group comparisons to capture both internal transmission mechanisms and contextual heterogeneity. As an empirical illustration, questionnaire data were collected from 512 respondents across 32 universities in China, encompassing both research-oriented and practice-oriented institutions. The survey instruments measured respondents’ perceptions of PDM, LF, adaptive governance capacity (AGC), managerial support, and digital collaboration tools using established multi-item scales. The results show that PDM enhances adaptive governance primarily through LF, indicating that participation contributes to sustainability by operating as a perceived learning mechanism rather than a one-off procedural input. Overall, the findings suggest interpreting participatory governance as a perception-based, feedback-oriented decision–learning–adaptation process, highlighting the role of learning in adaptive university governance.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 27%, but further improvements of both PCEs and stability are needed for commercialization. One of the key factors hindering their development is the unpredictable residual strain in perovskites. The unstable octahedral structure of the perovskite cage leads to easy changes in bond lengths, bond angles, and crystal structure. It in turn generates, accumulates, and causes the non‐uniform distribution of residual strain, ultimately affecting device performance. Therefore, given the versatility and precise tunability, residual strain engineering provides an effective pathway to optimize the performance of PSCs. This review summarizes the causes of residual strain during device fabrication and operation, qualitative/quantitative/auxiliary characterization methods, and various effective strain regulation methods in the past two years. Finally, unresolved scientific issues and future research directions in strain engineering are discussed. This comprehensive review aims to provide researchers with the latest advances in strain engineering, deepen fundamental understanding of strain effects, and eventually help enhance the performance of PSCs.",

    "Abstract": "The coexistence of Cu in copper sulfate electrolyte significantly affects the microstructure and performance of the copper foil. So far, there has been little quantitative analysis of Cu+ in the electrolyte during the copper foil production process. This paper fabricated a 2,2′-Biquinoline (BIQ) modified expanded graphite (EG) electrode electrochemical sensor for the selective determination of Cu+. EG, with its large specific surface area and excellent adsorption and electrochemical properties, significantly enhances analytical sensitivity. Additionally, BIQ’s specific coordination with Cu+ improves the sensor’s rapid and effective quantification of Cu+ in the electrolytic copper foil electrolyte. The linear equation of this sensor is I = 0.03769 + 0.29997 × c (R2 = 0.9989), with a detection limit of 8 μg/L (S/N = 3). The BIQ-modified EG electrode has good selectivity for Cu+, with a recovery rate for cuprous ions of 101.00% to 105.00% under the coexistence of 10,000 times Cu2+, and an RSD of less than 2%. This sensor’s efficient, sensitive, and selective detection of Cu+ can be an effective method to improve the quality of electrolytic copper foil products.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The comprehensive investments of Ti 2 MnCoS 2 Double Half Heusler (DHH) alloy were studied using first-principles calculations. The electronic properties indicate that the Ti 2 MnCoS 2 DHH alloy exhibits semiconductor behavior. The equilibrium lattice parameters are a = b = 5.48 Å and c = 10.96 Å. The band gap values at these parameters are 0.840 eV and 1.007 eV for the GGA and GGA + mBJ approximations, respectively. The bulk modulus values were obtained as 173.4365 GPa, 165.655 GPa, and 169.752 GPa in structural, elastic, and thermodynamic calculations, respectively. These similarities demonstrate the consistency of the calculations for Ti 2 MnCoS 2 semiconductor DHH alloy. The alloy is mechanically stable and ductile with a Poisson’s ratio of 0.281. The optical properties reveal that the material exhibits not only its electronic properties but also interesting characteristics under light, particularly in the visible light region. Thermodynamic calculations confirmed its structural stability under varying pressure and temperature. Elastic calculations determined the Debye temperature to be 543.076 K. Thermodynamic data also showed a value of 582.57 K at 0 GPa and 0 K. The Gibbs energy curve indicates that the Ti 2 MnCoS 2 semiconductor DHH alloy maintains structural stability across different external conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Advanced Trauma Life Support® (ATLS®) is the most widely adopted form of trauma life support training worldwide, but there is no high-quality evidence that it can improve patient outcomes. The aim of this trial is to compare the effects of ATLS® training with standard care on outcomes in adult trauma patients. Methods ADVANCE TRAUMA is a batched stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial in India, where ATLS® is not routinely implemented. The trial will be conducted in 30 clusters (hospitals), organised into six batches of five clusters each. All clusters transition through three phases: first, a standard care phase; second, a 1-month transition phase, during which the training is delivered; and finally, an intervention phase, for a total of 13 months. Each cluster is randomised to an implementation sequence that defines the duration of the standard care and intervention phases. The trial will include at least 4320 adult trauma patients (≥ 15 years) who present to emergency departments and are subsequently admitted or transferred for admission. The primary outcome is in-hospital mortality within 30 days of arrival at the emergency department. Discussion This will be the first large-scale trial to provide robust evidence of the effectiveness of ATLS® since the programme was initiated in 1978. Regardless of the findings, this study will have important implications for trauma life support training globally. If ATLS® training improves patient outcomes, ways to promote its use and optimise its implementation, especially in low- and middle-income countries such as India, should be explored. If patient outcomes do not improve, trauma life support training must change.

Historically, melatonin has been seen as a pineal hormone that plays one essential role – the synchronisation of reproductive and other brain-controlled functions with changes in photoperiod. Often driven by the detection of melatonin receptors in non-brain tissues, it has become clear that melatonin plays a much wider variety of roles in the function of the testis, sperm, ovary, follicles, oocyte, embryo, placenta, fetus, and mammary gland. This collection presents this broader view of melatonin biology, and how the new concepts can be applied to livestock production.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: In food-producing animal (FPA) environments, healthy animals can act as reservoirs of potentially pathogenic Escherichia coli, which can be transmitted through the food chain to humans. This study aimed to evaluate cloacal E. coli in healthy Sicilian lambs subjected to an experimental feeding regimen by assessing bacterial levels, antimicrobial resistance, virulence traits, and the clonal relationships, as well as the impact of a pistachio skin as an agro-industrial by-product supplement during a 58-day feeding trial. Methods: A total of 295 E. coli isolates from the control (CTRL) and treatment (Treated) groups at initial time (T0) and final time (T1) were phenotypically and genotypically characterized using Kirby–Bauer antimicrobial testing, multiplex PCR for virulence genes, and PFGE for clonal analysis. Results: The feeding regimen did not significantly influence the prevalence, abundance, or virulence of the E. coli isolates. Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) were the most common pathotype, mainly carrying the stx1 gene, while the Enteroinvasive (EIEC) type was detected only sporadically. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) predominated at T0, while enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) at T1, and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), initially prevalent in Treated samples, disappeared by T1. Antimicrobial resistance profiles varied among isolates, with the highest resistance observed in the CTRL group. However, both groups exhibited high resistance to streptomycin, and 9% of CTRL isolates were multidrug resistant. A notable reduction in overall resistance rates, especially in the Treated group, was observed, indicating a dietary effect on the E. coli resistome. PFGE genotyping showed high genetic diversity, with resistance traits more frequently detected than virulence factors. Conclusions: This study highlights that healthy lambs serve as reservoirs for potentially human-pathogenic E. coli and suggests that dietary regimes could effectively reduce antibiotic resistance.",

Furthermore, supplementation with fermented sweet potato (FSPE) ethanol extract resulted in a significant reduction in body weight gain, adipocyte hypertrophy, and hepatic lipid accumulation, while also improving serum lipid profiles in high-fat diet-induced obesity mice. These physiological improvements were associated with the downregulated expression of adipogenic and inflammatory genes in both liver and adipose tissues. Furthermore, lipidomic analysis revealed that FSPE modulated key lipid species, including ceramides and acylcarnitines, which are implicated in metabolic dysfunction. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that lactic acid fermentation enhanced purple sweet potato’s functional potential, positioning FSPE as a promising candidate for dietary intervention in obesity management.",

    "Abstract": "Many companies in the mining industry include decarbonization of production among their key strategic goals as part of their internal sustainability strategy. This need is driven by a number of factors: stricter regulation in the area of carbon footprint (introduction of carbon taxes, emissions quotas, reporting requirements); sustained growth in demand for electricity and rising market prices; economic feasibility—the need to optimize operating costs and improve energy efficiency. This study provides a comprehensive technical and economic justification for implementing a hybrid power supply system—combining a solar power plant (SPP) and a gas engine power plant (GPP)—at Solidcore Resources’ Varvarinsky hub in Kazakhstan. The methodology includes modeling the energy balance of the real asset (156.9 GWh of annual energy consumption), calculating the output of a 22.6 MW SPP based on local GHI/PR/η parameters, forming and determining the adaptability coefficient Kₐ (proportion of PV in total monthly electricity generation), conducting an economic assessment (NPV, payback period, sensitivity), and inventorying CO2 emissions under Scope 1–2. The SPP provides approximately 41.3 GWh of electricity generation per year, with an average annual Ka = 0.263; the 40 MW installed capacity of the gas piston power plant covers the residual demand, forming a stable daily and seasonal balance. The project demonstrates a positive NPV (After Tax) = USD 23.65 million with an estimated payback period of 10 years, while the cost of energy in extraction and processing is reduced by almost three times, and the total reduction in CO2 emissions will be 51%. Thus, hybridization of energy supply systems is a practical compromise between reliability and decarbonization. Determining the adaptability coefficient Ka allows the flexibility of the system to be taken into account, shows how effectively the new energy system uses renewable energy sources, and can be used to optimize the operation of the energy system to achieve the company’s internal sustainable development goals.",

This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of QACs in assisted living facilities through the analysis of 19 QACs from three different QAC subgroups in indoor dust and air samples collected from three assisted living facilities in Indiana, United States (US), as well as in wristbands worn by the residents and staff of these facilities. The medians of the total QAC concentrations (∑QAC, the sum of 19 QAC concentrations) were 151,000 ng/g in dust, 3.17 ng/m<sup>3</sup> in air, and 2,290 ng/g in wristbands. Benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (BACs) were the most abundant QAC group in all three matrices and contributed 58-87% to the ∑QAC concentrations. The QAC distribution patterns found in dust, air, and wristbands were similar to those reported for disinfecting products, suggesting these products could be an important indoor source in assisted living. QAC concentrations in wristbands worn by staff during their work shift were significantly higher than those in wristbands worn by residents (<i>p</i> < 0.05). In addition, the levels found in dust from assisted living were several times higher than those previously reported in US residential households. Concentrations of C12-, C14-, and C16-BACs in dust, air, and wristbands significantly and positively correlated, suggesting common sources in the indoor environment. Estimated daily intake (EDI) of QACs suggests that accidental dust ingestion is the predominant exposure route, accounting for approximately 62% of the total QAC intake. The elevated QAC concentrations in assisted living facilities are of concern for the residents and staff of these facilities because of the potential health risks associated with exposure to these chemicals, such as respiratory effects.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The silicon photovoltaics market is transitioning from the incumbent passivated emitter rear cell to the higher efficiency tunnel oxide passivated contact technology and it is crucial to understand the environmental impact of this change. Here, we conduct life cycle assessment to compare both technologies quantitatively and identify environmental savings in 15 of 16 environmental impact categories for tunnel oxide passivated contact. This includes a 6.5% reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, per watt peak at the expense of 15.2% increase in metal resource use, for photovoltaic modules manufactured in China and transported to central Europe. A critical factor in photovoltaics manufacturing is the carbon intensity of the electricity mix. We model the impact of photovoltaics production across different global regions, incorporating future electricity mix scenarios and a projection for photovoltaics deployment. Our model provides a forecast of the environmental impact of global photovoltaics manufacturing and identifies a potential reduction of 8.2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 2035, depending on manufacturing location.",

    "Abstract": "Antigenic variation in Trypanosoma brucei ( T. brucei ) requires monoallelic expression of one variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) from one of the subtelomeric bloodstream form (BSF) expression sites (BESs). This transcription is unusually mediated by RNA polymerase I (RNA Pol I) and occurs in a specialized nuclear body, the expression site body (ESB). While factors promoting active BES transcription and silencing inactive BESs are known, how these opposing activities are integrated remains unknown. Here, we identify ESBX (Tb927.3.1660) as a BSF-specific ESB protein necessary for this coordination. We show that ESBX RNAi knockdown prevents RNA Pol I localizing to the ESB and reduces active BES transcription, while also derepressing inactive BESs with low processivity transcription. Conversely, ESBX overexpression weakly activates inactive BESs in a distinct manner from ESBX knockdown, leading to processive transcription, without disrupting the active BES or forming supernumerary ESBs. ESBX knockdown causes a similar transcriptomic defect to ESB1 and VEX2 knockdown combined, establishing ESBX as a key factor linking transcriptional activation of the active BES with inactive BES silencing through the VSG exclusion (VEX) phenomenon. This allows us to suggest models for understanding the establishment and maintenance of monoallelic expression critical for parasite immune evasion.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The major anxiety disorders (ANX; including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and phobias) are highly prevalent, often onset early and cause substantial global disability. Although distinct in their clinical presentations, they probably represent differential expressions of a dysregulated threat–response system. Here, we present a genome-wide association meta-analysis comprising 122,341 European ancestry ANX cases and 729,881 controls. We identified 58 independent genome-wide significant risk variants and 66 genes with robust biological support. In an independent sample of 1,175,012 self-report ANX cases and 1,956,379 controls, 51 out of the 58 associations replicated. As predicted by twin studies, we found substantial genetic correlation between ANX and depression, neuroticism and other internalizing phenotypes. Follow-up analyses demonstrated enrichment in all major brain regions and highlighted GABAergic signaling as one potential mechanism implicated in ANX genetic risk. These results advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of ANX and prioritize genes for functional follow-up studies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The density and viscosity of binary mixtures of triethanolamine (TEA) and glycerol were investigated over the full composition range at temperatures from 293.15 K to 323.15 K, under atmospheric pressure. The experimentally measured density and viscosity data were correlated with temperature-dependent equations. The excess molar volume ( V E ) and viscosity deviation ( Δη ) were determined and fitted using the Redlich–Kister polynomial equation. In addition, thermodynamic parameters, including partial molar volumes, apparent molar volumes, and thermal expansion coefficients, were evaluated to provide further insight into the mixing behavior of the system. Negative values of V E and Δη were observed over the entire range of temperatures and compositions investigated, indicating the presence of strong specific interactions between TEA and glycerol molecules. These interactions were further elucidated through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The computational results are consistent with the experimental observations, providing molecular-level support for the non-ideal volumetric and viscosity behavior of the mixtures.",

    "Abstract": "Malignancy-related gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) remains a significant clinical challenge, contributing substantially to morbidity, mortality, and healthcare utilization in patients with cancer. Up to 10% of individuals with advanced malignancies develop GIB during their disease, and these episodes are frequently characterized by a high risk of rebleeding and poor long-term hemostatic control. Tumor-associated bleeding typically arises from friable, infiltrative, and highly vascular lesions that respond suboptimally to conventional endoscopic techniques such as thermal coagulation or mechanical clipping. These limitations underscore the need for improved diagnostic accuracy and more reliable therapeutic options. Recent advances in imaging modalities, including contrast-enhanced CT studies, have enhanced the ability to localize and characterize bleeding sources in complex oncologic cases. Parallel developments in endoscopic hemostasis—such as over-the-scope clips and contact-free coagulation devices—have expanded the therapeutic armamentarium for managing malignant bleeding. Clinically, topical hemostatic powders—particularly TC-325—represent a highly effective option for achieving rapid endoscopic hemostasis, supported by the strongest comparative evidence and the highest rates of immediate bleeding control among currently available technologies. In this review, we synthesize contemporary diagnostic approaches to GIB and place particular emphasis on the evolving and emerging therapeutic strategies for malignancy-related bleeding. We also highlight innovative technologies that are reshaping clinical practice and improving management options in this challenging clinical domain.",

    "Abstract": "This study examines the evolving role of board heterogeneity, including gender diversity, board attributes, and governance practices, in shaping corporate risk outcomes. In mature governance settings, corporate risk management emerges from the interaction between board structure, independence, leadership arrangements, and boardroom composition, such that gender diversity in isolation may no longer fully capture board effectiveness. We argue that while gender diversity remains relevant, its explanatory power operates in conjunction with other board characteristics that condition the quality of decision-making in already well-functioning boards. Using multiple regression estimations on a sample of STOXX600 firms, our main outcomes show that in mature European boards gender diversity (1) improves the operational efficiency, conditional by model specification, (2) increase debts level to finance growth, thereby enabling more rapid expansion than would otherwise be possible, without pushing to extensive borrowing, while reduce leverage starting 33% (3) prevents corporate failure starting 40% women on board (4) gender-diverse boards increase liquidity when critical mass is met (33%). Overall, the findings suggest that gender-diverse boards contribute to a reconfiguration of firms’ risk exposure across operational, financial, liquidity, and failure dimensions, rather than a uniform reduction in risk.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The usual asset pricing models perform well when large datasets are available, particularly with the advent of big data and artificial intelligence. However, they are generally unable to meet current assessment needs when only few data are available. For example, in agricultural land valuation, farmland transactions are generally non-recurring actions for most buyers and sellers, and expert knowledge is often the sole source of information, posing significant challenges for decision-makers. A valuation method based on two distribution (or reliability) functions was developed to estimate asset value using only expert-based knowledge of the asset and its characteristics. However, this comparative method and its multidimensional extensions tend to produce extreme valuations. This paper introduces competing risks and complementary risks models within this probabilistic framework to support asset valuation under high uncertainty and data scarcity. The proposed method synchronizes the asset value distribution with the minimum and maximum statistics of the explanatory variables, yielding more moderate and realistic valuations. The results confirm that embedding these risk models refines asset assessments by mitigating the appraisal biases induced by the two-function valuation methods across any k -dimensional explanatory vector. Empirical evidence from two applications in agricultural land valuation supports the theoretical findings. The results show minimal impact of the shape parameters on valuation outcomes and limited sensitivity to the expert’s most likely value, exhibiting reasonable performance. Accordingly, the minimum and maximum statistics can serve as stochastic smoothing tools for valuation, thereby extending the applicability of valuation methods in data-scarce markets.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Purpose To evaluate 6‐month knowledge retention and long‐term satisfaction after two pedagogical escape games (PEGs) addressing foundational (3D printing) and clinical (pediatric dentistry) content in a dental curriculum. Methods In this monocentric serial cross‐sectional study, immediate post‑PEG knowledge was assessed in fifth‑year dental students using two 16‑item true/false tests on 3D printing and pediatric dentistry ( n = 176 and n = 190, respectively). Delayed knowledge was assessed 6 months later using the same tests in independent cohorts of sixth‑year students who had previously completed the same PEGs ( n = 106 and n = 116). A five‑item Likert‑scale questionnaire completed by sixth‑year students ( n = 127) captured long‑term satisfaction and perceived educational value. Between‐cohort comparisons used Wilcoxon rank‐sum tests. Results Knowledge scores declined for 3D printing (13.83 ± 2.19 vs. 12.13 ± 1.89/16, p &lt; 0.05) and remained stable for pediatric dentistry (13.23 ± 1.61 vs. 12.92 ± 1.54/16, p &gt; 0.05). Losses in 3D‑printing knowledge were concentrated on conceptual and procedural items. Delayed satisfaction remained high, with strong lasting impressions of the PEGs, perceived learning benefits, improved perception of the disciplines, and a clear desire for more PEGs in the curriculum. Conclusion Six‑month knowledge retention differed by domain, likely reflecting routine clinical reinforcement for pediatric dentistry and lack of downstream rehearsal for 3D printing. Embedding brief spaced refreshers for foundational topics and relying on clinical exposure for consolidation of clinical content may help sustain learning over time. Findings support integration of PEGs with follow‐up.",

    "Abstract": "The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region is one of the areas in China with the highest level of transportation integration, featuring a well-developed high-speed rail network, multimodal transport system, interconnected intercity bus services, and intelligent transportation platforms. These developments have brought about significant effects of time-space compression in the region. Under the effects of time-space compression, the changes in the regional socio-economic spatial structure are worth further exploration. To this end, from the perspective of accessibility, this study explores the time–space compression effect in the YRD region using models such as economic linkage strength (ELS), central city isochronous-ring, daily accessibility (DA), and employment accessibility (EA) indicators. The results show: (1) The time distance between central cities and prefectural-level and lower-tier cities has greatly decreased, resulting in a network-based structure and a trend towards urban system flattening; within 1–2 hours of central cities, the scale of the population, number of cities, and regional coverage area have rapidly expanded, promoting regional integration and urban agglomeration. (2) Intercity time-space compression has significantly increased the total ELS between cities, intensifying the “strong center” economic linkage pattern. The radiation and driving capacity of central cities for the region has notably increased, and the equilibrium of urban economic linkage capabilities has improved. (3) Time-space compression strengthens the “competitive-cooperative effect” of central cities, facilitating the convenient sharing and equalization of high-quality urban public services, but also leading to tensions in the supply and demand of these resources. (4) A high-accessibility region has formed in the “Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou” triangle, where high-accessibility cities possess larger market hinterlands and more employment opportunities, providing significant opportunities for the rise of small and medium-sized cities in peripheral areas. Based on these findings, in the context of time-space compression, these regions should actively build convenient, efficient, and resilient commuting and transfer networks. A networked spatial development strategy should be implemented, establishing efficient regional collaboration mechanisms and public service cooperation systems to promote coordinated regional development.",

    "Abstract": "Despite growing interest in online health communities (OHCs), prior studies report inconsistent findings regarding the factors that drive users' continuous engagement. Furthermore, little is known about the relative importance of these factors and their hierarchical interactions. To address these gaps, this study poses two research questions: What are the key determinants of continuous OHC usage, and how do these determinants interact within a hierarchical structure? We conducted a meta-analysis of empirical studies to extract 16 critical factors, and applied the FUZZY-DEMATEL-AISM method to construct a multi-layered framework capturing their interrelationships. The findings reveal that attitude functions as the most direct top-level determinant, while trust, perceived value, and self-efficacy serve as transitional drivers. In contrast, system quality, service quality, and technology anxiety form the foundational layer influencing user behavior. This study contributes to theory by elucidating the structural logic underlying OHC engagement and to practice by providing actionable insights for enhancing user retention and optimizing digital health platform design. The results offer a systematic roadmap for researchers and practitioners aiming to understand and improve sustained user participation in digital health communities.",

    "Abstract": "Genetic diversity, the fundamental substrate for evolutionary potential, is declining globally at unprecedented rates. Yet the mechanisms governing its distribution across species remain poorly understood, with competing hypotheses emphasizing either historical demography or contemporary ecological constraints. This debate limits our capacity to predict species' responses to environmental change. Here, based on systematic sampling and a unified analytical pipeline, we de novo assembled genomes for 120 songbird species breeding in the Himalayas–Hengduan Mountains (HHMs) and conducted population genomic analysis to examine the drivers of their genomic diversity. We observed a 6.5-fold variation in genome-wide heterogeneity and a 16.4-fold variation nucleotide diversity across species. Notably, these measures of genomic diversity showed no correlation with recent population dynamics, current population size, or other contemporary factors—such as elevational distribution, or life-history traits. Instead, historical demography strongly predicted genetic diversity, with ancestral population size during the late Pleistocene emerging as the sole correlate: Larger ancestral sizes consistently coincided with higher diversity. These findings underscore the critical influence of historical demography on contemporary genetic diversity in natural populations—an insight essential for designing effective conservation strategies.",

    "Abstract": "The initial dispersal routes and subsequent exchange networks of Austronesian speaking populations in Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) and Near Oceania continue to be debated. Accurate and precise chronologies on pottery assemblages are key in clarifying these population movements and dynamics. Previous scholars have suggested red-slipped pottery may be a proxy for Malayo-Polynesian speakers’ presence, and Lapita pottery may be a proxy for Proto-Oceanic speakers. Under this premise, pottery assemblages found between eastern Indonesia and the Bismarck Archipelago have the potential to inform us about the arrivals and movements of new Austronesian languages to the region and their possible connections with Lapita peoples that voyaged into the Pacific. The generally poor resolution of the archaeological and radiocarbon record from this part of the Pacific calls for more research to settle the debate. Mololo Cave is a site in the Raja Ampat Islands off the western coast of New Guinea, containing the earliest reported pottery assemblages in the area, including red-slipped and plainware Lapitoid pottery. This paper presents 11 new radiocarbon dates and Mololo’s first two Bayesian age models to increase the robusticity of the date estimates at the site and enable chronological comparisons with similar pottery assemblages from the region. Most of the pottery sherds, including both red-slipped and Lapitoid pottery, emerge after 3090–2258 cal BP, potentially being as early as 3903–3420 cal BP. This chronological model provides critical information about the dispersal of pottery-making groups around the far western Pacific during the initial expansion of Austronesian languages into the region.",

Inspired by questions posed in recent work on local energy, we investigate this quantity in two structured families: broom trees and double-star trees. For broom trees, we identify the vertices that attain maximal and minimal local energy, both within a fixed broom and across the class of all brooms with a given number of vertices. While the general case of double-broom trees remains open due to the complex behavior of vertices along the central path, we provide a complete solution for the subclass of double-star trees. These results enhance the overall understanding of vertex-level energy distribution and encourage further developments in the spectral analysis of trees.",

    "Abstract": "Despite the economic importance of lithium, there is considerable disagreement over the processes that concentrate it and other rare metals in pegmatite-type lithium deposits. Two main processes have been invoked, namely extreme differentiation of a peraluminous granitic magma and direct anatexis of a sedimentary protolith. We use geochemical modeling to quantify lithium enrichment via these two processes from a study of the Jiajika lithium pegmatite field, one of the largest of its type in the world. Based on a lithium–silicon–boron–barium (Li-Si-B-Ba) isotope study involving systematic sampling along 4,211-m of core from two deep boreholes and from the regional zonation of pegmatites at outcrops, we propose a three-stage model for the formation of the pegmatite field: i) generation of a rare metal-rich melt by deep anatexis, involving ~5% partial melting of metapelitic rocks in the presence of 10 to 30% metamorphic fluid; ii) gradual enrichment of rare metals along a path of continuous magma differentiation until 75% of the initial melt had crystallized; and iii) a final stage of lithium mineralization during the escape of the water-rich magma due to the overpressures created in response to massive fluid exsolution and the extensional stress in the granite dome structure. The study provides important insights into how lithium-rich pegmatites can be targeted during exploration for pegmatite-hosted resources of lithium.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Major congenital malformations are common, and most cases have no known etiology because of complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors and variable phenotypic outcomes. Congenital NAD Deficiency Disorder (CNDD), a cause of multiple congenital malformations and embryo loss, exemplifies this variability in phenotypic presentation, even between siblings with the same underlying genetic variants. Mouse models show that CNDD is caused by embryonic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) deficiency because of the embryos' genetic inability to synthesize NAD and/or insufficient maternal provision of NAD precursors to embryos. But it is unknown when during pregnancy embryos become susceptible to developing malformations and what drives the malformation variability. Here, we induced CNDD in wild‐type mice via the maternal diet and longitudinally tracked affected and unaffected embryos in utero. We compared 3‐day interval measurements of the maternal blood NAD metabolome with embryo phenotype using Fast Spin Echo Magnetic Resonance Imaging, mass spectrometry, and micro‐computed tomography. Malformations varied between litters, but they correlated with different embryo growth dynamics. Mice with lower maternal NAD Salvage Pathway metabolite levels and minimal levels of derived excretion metabolites from embryonic day 6.5 onward had smaller embryos with more malformations. This showed that altered embryo growth and reduced maternal NAD precursor availability during organogenesis resulted in CNDD. Variability in the timing of maternal metabolic perturbation corresponded to variability in organ and tissue defect types between litters. As embryo phenotypes are directly linked to maternal NAD precursor availability prior to and during organogenesis, this suggests NAD‐derived metabolites are potential biomarkers predicting CNDD.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Technological advances, including remote sensing, have led to a proliferation of metrics used in ecological studies to examine spatial patterns of fire regimes and their ecological effects. Researchers can use many different metrics to analyse spatial variation in both fire events and resulting fire regimes, including fire size, shape, intensity, frequency and seasonality. However, variation in metric selection, definition, and application can yield inconsistent findings and/or difficulty in the synthesis of findings from different studies. This review aims to ( i ) visualise trends in spatial terminology within the broader fire ecology literature, ( ii ) characterise the variability among metrics for describing spatial fire patterns, and ( iii ) evaluate the ecological relevance of metrics, identifying opportunities to enhance consistency. This review comprises three sections. First, we used topic modelling to determine topic trends in fire ecology over the last three decades (1991–2025). We found a shift from studies primarily focused on individual fire regime aspects to a more holistic approach incorporating multiple fire regime aspects, including spatial patterns. Second, we present findings from a qualitative review, revealing marked variation in metric selection within and among taxa, biomes, and the technique used to measure spatial metrics. We also identified ecological processes, such as dispersal capacity, that prompt researchers to use more specific metrics to analyse their study system more precisely, leading to less consistency among studies. Finally, we offer recommendations for enhancing metric consistency whilst maintaining the flexibility to adapt and develop those metrics most relevant and informative for a given objective. As technological advances allow for a more complete description of the spatial attributes of a fire regime, there is a potential trade‐off between generality and precision, reducing comparability among studies. To ensure ecological relevance, it is crucial to consider the characteristics of data, landscape, and ecological contexts when selecting and applying metrics. Recent advances in landscape analysis techniques, such as through applying information theory, are leading to metrics that can be broadly applicable across study systems. Using the most generalised metrics possible, reporting standardised metrics of all fire regime components, aligning with landscape ecology where appropriate, and staying updated on emerging techniques will ensure the fire ecology field can move forward with a more coordinated approach.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: HPV vaccination rates among U.S. young adults remain unchanged at 47% since 2019. Barriers including misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, and stigma surrounding HPV’s long-standing association with sexually transmitted infections have limited widespread acceptance among the male population. This experimental study explores how prevention messages incorporating an emotional flow element may influence vaccination intention. It also examines whether vaccination status may differentiate pre-exposure risk-taking tendencies and vaccine perceptions—as well as post-exposure HPV susceptibility, HPV severity, vaccine effectiveness, and emotional response—among young adults. Methods: A one-factor between-subjects experiment (including facts-only vs. facts→threat vs. facts→threat→hope conditions) was conducted online with a group of Gen Z college students at a U.S. university (N = 440). Results: ANCOVA results indicated that emotional flow embedded in the three message conditions did not result in significantly different emotional responses (across all participants) or vaccination intention among the unvaccinated participants. Whereas vaccinated participants reported greater perceived vaccine benefits, HPV susceptibility, HPV severity, and vaccine effectiveness, unvaccinated participants exhibited stronger emotional responses toward the facts→threat→hope message instead. Regression results revealed that vaccine perceptions, risk-taking tendencies, HPV susceptibility, and emotional response significantly predicted vaccination intention, in that order. TV advertising was identified as the leading HPV information source, followed by social media advertisements and recommendations from health professionals. Conclusions: These findings highlight that incorporating emotional flow may enhance message engagement among unvaccinated individuals. HPV campaigns should consider increasing positive vaccine perceptions, alleviating perceived threat of HPV, and eliciting positive emotional response toward vaccination acceptance and adoption.",

This study aimed to analyze the awareness, acceptance and concerns regarding the use of AI in healthcare among primary care patients in rural and small-town regions of Poland. This is characteristic of the country, as over 60% of its population lives in such regions. It also sought to identify the demographic and psychosocial determinants of trust in AI. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a paper questionnaire distributed to 545 adult patients in three primary care facilities in towns with populations below 20,000. Demographics, digital literacy, and attitudes towards AI were assessed. Statistical analyses included non-parametric tests and ordinal logistic regression. Most of the respondents expressed neutrality (43%) or a negative (31%) attitudes toward AI. Only 12.7% had direct experience with AI, and full trust in AI-assisted diagnoses was low (5.9%). Education was the strongest predictor of a positive AI attitude ( P &lt; 0.001); age was also significant ( P = 0.04), while gender and place of residence were not. Most patients (86%) emphasized the importance of medical staff support. Patients in areas of low digital literacy approach AI with cautious optimism, valuing its potential but requiring human oversight. To foster an equitable adoption of AI, communication and education efforts must address patient concerns and expectations.",

    "Abstract": "Background: The digitalization of clinical research has increased reliance on electronic portals (e-portals), with significant implications for trial site operations. Our aim is to map the types and number of e-portals required for clinical trials on solid tumors conducted at the Niguarda Cancer Center. Methods: We performed an aggregated analysis of 65 interventional drug trials (phase I–III) initiated between August 2022 and March 2025. For each study, the number and type of e-portals required at the site were recorded and stratified by sponsor type. Analyses were conducted using R. Results: A total of 65 trials were included (57 industry-sponsored, 8 academic). The mean number of e-portals per study was 5.3, with 66.1% of trials requiring 5–7 portals. Industry-sponsored trials employed significantly more e-portals than academic ones (mean ± SD: 5.8 ± 1.7 vs. 1.13 ± 0.35; t(41)=22.10, p&lt;0.0001). Electronic Data Capture (EDC) systems were universally implemented (100%). Additional portals for randomization (IXRS), central laboratories, imaging, and safety reporting were common in industry-sponsored trials but rarely used in academic studies. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were included in ~49% of industry and 88% of academic trials; 89% of PROs in industry studies were captured via ePRO portals, while academic trials mostly relied on paper forms or EDC integration. Conclusions: Industry-sponsored oncology trials impose a high digital workload on sites. Vendor streamlining, single sign-on solutions, open API standards, and shared ePRO infrastructures could improve efficiency, interoperability, and data quality.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The study evaluated the effect of monsoons on the levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the Hooghly River estuary sediments over 2018–2021. It was observed a cyclical enrichment of organic material, carbonate deposits, and clay over the post-monsoon and impoverishment over the monsoon because of the heavy rains and flood events. The mean total level of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was 1682 ng/g with a wide range of variability depending on the season, 125–6518 ng/g, higher than previous assays and lower than a contemporary survey. Also, there was a marked predominance of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon heavy pool, ~ 83%, with fluoranthene and pyrene making more than 40% of the total hydrocarbons loads and with a large variability of the composition with the monsoon. Concerning the numerical sediment quality guidelines, the mean individual compound levels, and ∑PAHs, do not surpass effect range low, effect range median, and apparent effects threshold limits and keep fairly below thresholds with no evidence of detrimental biological consequences. Temporal trends of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons split over two periods after the 2019 monsoon, with a sudden drop in hydrocarbon levels from two times for naphthalene, acenaphthylene, pyrene, benzo(a)anthracene, chrysene, to 6–7 times for phenanthrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, benzo(a)pyrene, and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, with an overall decrease of ∑PAHs of threefold from 2948 to 959 ng/g. Monsoon seems to play as a sort of natural attenuation effect, slowing down river decline.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Carfilzomib (CFZ) and bortezomib (BTZ) are proteasome inhibitors used as the first-line therapy for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) but are associated with cardiovascular adverse events (CVAEs). This study aims to identify differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs), and enriched pathways associated with CVAEs related to CFZ or BTZ-based treatment. Methods: Baseline germline DNA methylation profiles from 79 MM patients (49 on CFZ and 30 on BTZ) in the Prospective Study of Cardiac Events During Proteasome Inhibitor Therapy (PROTECT) were analyzed. Epigenome-wide analyses were performed within each group, followed by meta-analyses to identify signals common to CVAEs associated with both medicines. Results: Four DMPs were significantly associated with CFZ-CVAEs, including cg15144237 within ENSG00000224400 (p = 9.45 × 10−10), cg00927646 within TBX3 (p = 9.78 × 10−8), and cg10965131 within WDR86 (p = 1.00 × 10−7). One DMR was identified in the FAM166B region (p = 5.46 × 10−7). There was no evidence of any DMPs in BTZ-treated patients, however two DMPs and one DMR reached a suggestive level of significance (p &lt; 1.00 × 10−5): cg09666417 in DNAJC18 (p = 3.41 × 10−7) and cg12987761 in USP18 (p = 5.00 × 10−7), and a DMR mapped to the WDR86/WDR86-AS1 region (p = 8.11 × 10−8). Meta-analysis did not find any significant DMPs, with the top CpG being cg17933807 in GNL2 (p = 7.38 × 10−5). Pathway enrichment analyses identified peroxisome, MAPK, Rap1, adherens junction, phospholipase D, autophagy, and aldosterone-related pathways to be implicated in CVAEs. Conclusions: Our study identified distinct DMPs, DMRs, and pathways enrichment associated with CVAE, suggesting epigenetic contributors to CVAEs and supporting the need for larger validation studies.",

    "Abstract": "Objective: To assess the proportion of unresectable colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) patients meeting liver transplant (LT) criteria and define their outcomes following hepatic artery infusion pump (HAIP) chemotherapy. Summary Background Data: The TransMet RCT demonstrates improved survival with combined LT and systemic versus systemic therapy alone; however, systemic therapy might not be the best control. This study assesses outcomes in similarly selected patients treated with HAIP. Methods: We identified unresectable CRLM patients treated with HAIP between 2006-2016. Modified TransMet/SECA-II selection criteria were applied, including pre-treatment with at least 1 st line chemotherapy before HAIP placement. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods from HAIP placement. Results: Of 483 patients identified, 23 (4.8%) were LT-eligible. Median age was 52 years (range:37,73). Primary tumors were right-sided in 6 (23%) and rectal in 12 (52%). Eight (38%) patients were KRAS mut . Median CRLM size and number were 28 mm (range:9,92) and 11 (range:4,38). Median pre-HAIP chemotherapy cycles were 8 (range:3,20), and most patients were on 1 st (15,65%) or 2 nd (7,30%) line therapy. Conversion to resection occurred in 18 (78%) patients after a median of 5 (range:1,20) HAIP chemotherapy cycles. With a median follow-up time of 98 (95%CI:96,NR) months, median OS was 61 (95%CI:36,92) months, and 5-year OS was 53% (95%CI:36,79). Median PFS was 13 (95%CI:10,22) months. Conclusions: In this cohort, less than 5% of unresectable CRLM patients were LT-eligible. After treatment with HAIP chemotherapy, overall 5-year survival was 53%, similar to a recent LT randomized trial (5-year OS 57%).",

    "Abstract": "Abstract The contribution of cocoa to the economies of countries, especially producing countries cannot be understated. However, volatility in the prices of commodities affect all stakeholders in the production value chain as it affects planning, policy implementation and mitigation of risks. Thus, it is very crucial to be able to forecast cocoa prices with a high degree of certainty. Hence, this study modeled cocoa prices in Ghana using 15 machine learning models and their corresponding decomposition based hybrid models. The machine learning models incorporated input variables, including interest rates, inflation rates and crude oil prices. Variational mode decomposition (VMD) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) techniques were applied to the data and the 15 models were further used to model the data, thus obtaining 30 hybrid models. The results of the study revealed that among the 15 machine learning models, quantile random forest model was the best for the data set. Generally, EEMD hybrid models performed better than the VMD based models, with EEMD-generalized additive model with splines being the best hybrid model. The findings show that interest rates play a major role in the prediction of cocoa prices in Ghana. This was closely followed by crude oil prices. Hence, it is recommended that policies that would reflect favorable interest rates and crude oil prices are implemented by policy makers.",

    "Abstract": "Wheelchair-mounted robotic arms (WMRAs) are assistive manipulators designed to increase the functional independence of individuals with limitations in the upper and lower extremities. While previous research has identified several visual, cognitive, and physical abilities that facilitate optimal operation of such a device, these have yet to be accounted for when designing the human–robot interface. This study investigates whether interface-level compensations can improve usability and support more personalized control across users with different abilities. Five interface compensations were implemented and evaluated: object highlighting, move suggestions, slowing near objects, a one-click approach, and a level indicator. A user study was conducted among individuals with spinal cord injury as well as able-bodied younger and older adults serving as comparison groups. Evaluations of task performance metrics, perceived WMRA usability, and user experience were conducted. The results indicate that younger adults achieved the highest task efficiency, followed closely by participants with spinal cord injury, with both groups reporting good-to-excellent usability, whereas older adults showed lower efficiency and rated the system as having fair usability. The one-click automated object approach feature was identified as the most useful compensation among all participant groups. Overall, participant feedback indicated that spatial visualization and spatial orientation were the most important individual differences affecting the operation of the arm.",

    "Abstract": "Paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel differ in therapeutic efficacy and modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment, yet the molecular basis remains poorly defined. Here, based on a meta-analysis, we first show that treatment with nab-paclitaxel results in a higher overall response rate and pathological complete response compared to paclitaxel in female patients with breast cancer. Notably, TREM2 expression in macrophages is elevated in primary tumors of paclitaxel- but not nab-paclitaxel-treated female patients. In metastatic breast cancer, TREM2<sup>+</sup> macrophage infiltration is increased in primary tumors. In breast cancer models in female mice, paclitaxel, but not nab-paclitaxel, promotes lung metastasis by recruiting TREM2<sup>+</sup> macrophages to primary tumors. Mechanistically, paclitaxel enhances the ATF3-FGF2 axis in breast cancer cells; secreted FGF2 activates the EGR1-TREM2-EMT cytokine axis in macrophages. Genetic ablation of Trem2 or pharmacologic targeting with antisense oligonucleotides suppress paclitaxel-induced breast cancer lung metastasis in vivo. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that paclitaxel, but not nab-paclitaxel, stimulates TREM2 expression and expands TREM2<sup>+</sup> macrophages, suggesting that TREM2 targeting could enhance paclitaxel efficacy while limiting metastasis.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background In China, therapeutic options are limited by the narrow availability of allergen preparations, with house dust mite (HDM) allergen immunotherapy (AIT) as the main choice for most patients. However, polysensitization is highly prevalent, and the benefit of HDM AIT in such patients remains uncertain. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of single‐allergen HDM AIT on both perennial and coexisting allergen‐specific symptoms in polysensitised allergic rhinitis (AR) patients and to explore predictors of treatment response. Methods We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study including 81 patients with AR who were polysensitised to HDM and at least one other inhalant allergen (e.g., pollens, mould or animal dander). All participants received HDM subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) for 12 to 36 months. Baseline characteristics, including serum allergen‐specific IgE (sIgE) levels and comorbidities, were collected. Symptom severity was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), and treatment response was defined as a ≥ 30% reduction in VAS scores from baseline. Statistical comparisons between responders and non‐responders were conducted using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and Mann–Whitney U tests for continuous data. Firth logistic regression was used to identify predictors of treatment response. Results The overall response rate for perennial symptoms was 68.8%, and varied in patients with co‐existing allergies: 72.7% for moulds, 70.0% for animal dander, 65.5% for tree pollen, 70.2% for weed pollens. Allergen‐specific symptom response rates varied across allergens: 68.2% for moulds, 30.0% for animal dander, 56.7% for tree pollens, 74.5% for weed pollens. Higher sIgE levels to HDM and mould were significantly associated with lower response rates in patients co‐sensitised to both. A predictive model incorporating both sIgEs showed good specificity. Conclusion Single‐allergen HDM AIT is effective in many polysensitised AR patients; however, its efficacy varies by coexisting allergen type and sIgE level. Patients co‐sensitised to mould with high HDM and mould sIgE appeared to have poorer outcomes. These preliminary findings require confirmation in larger prospective studies to guide tailored AIT strategies.",

    "Abstract": "In this scientific article, a quantitative assessment is carried out of the influence of the ERTMS modernisation factor on the practical efficiency of operation and resilience of the Belgian railway lines 50A/51A with the application of methodological triangulation in the MATLAB R2025a Update 1 (25.1.0.2973910) software environment (discrete-event modelling, Petri nets, Markov reliability modelling, and correlation analysis). The modelling reveals that the scenario with an expanded level of automation increases the capacity from 18.3 to 26.0 trains over 2 h (+42.1%) and reduces the average waiting time from 1.53 min (baseline level) to 0.21 min—virtually the theoretical lower bound of zero under favourable conditions. The results of the block-occupancy analysis by means of Petri nets show that a more dynamic distribution of blocks provides higher capacity, and Markov chains reflect the reduction of the impact of control centre unavailability in developing communications and virtualisations. Spearman correlation analysis additionally shows coordinated improvement of the metrics of safety, digital protection, resilience, and performance. Relying on the modelling results, a phased roadmap is proposed, combining technical improvements (development of communication systems, readiness for automation, comparable management of rolling stock movement) with compliance with regulatory requirements and the goals of sustainable development, related to SDGs 9, 11, and 13.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The World Health Organization has flagged the rise of drug resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus as a critical concern. Elevated mutation rates in this pathogen contribute to the rapid development of resistance, complicating treatment efforts. We conducted a study on the prevalence of azole resistance among clinical A. fumigatus isolates in the Netherlands from 1994 to 2022 and identified 34 cyp51A variants. To investigate the impact of individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and combinations thereof on the azole phenotype in TR 34 -mediated resistance genotypes, we focused on novel, recent mutations and explored the effects of SNPs L98H, T289A, I364V, and G448S and the combination of the mutations TR 34 /L98H, TR 34 /L98H/T289A/G448S, and TR 34 /L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S on azole affinity and susceptibility. We created the three-dimensional protein model of the Cyp51A protein with azoles, and the mutation was introduced to the wild-type cyp51A A. fumigatus strain by the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technique. Finally, in vitro susceptibility testing of A. fumigatus strains carrying the mutations was conducted to confirm the azole phenotypes observed in clinical isolates. The MICs of all four azoles against the mutated cyp51A strains, which harbored combination mutations, were higher than those of the wild type, with highly elevated MICs of itraconazole, voriconazole, and isavuconazole. Genotypes TR 34 /L98H/T289A/I364V/G448S mutant showed a consistent phenotype to the clinical strains, which are highly resistant to voriconazole but susceptible to itraconazole. In this study, we show that molecular dynamics simulations of amino acid substitutions in the cyp51A gene correlate to the structure–function relationship of in vitro phenotype.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The innovative crypto-world represents one of the most prominent manifestations of volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environments. In this context, the use of technology plays a fundamental role in ensuring the survival of firms operating within the business environment. Recently, the cryptocurrency derivatives market reached a monthly trading volume of $1.33 trillion, exceeding traditional spot markets and creating unprecedented challenges for digital asset exchanges in managing investment decisions. This paper presents a novel gate-based artificial intelligence (AI) framework for optimizing cryptocurrency derivative investment strategies in crypto-exchange companies’ operations through the implementation of new technology-based solutions. Design/methodology/approach The paper is supported by the quantitative methodology of system dynamics (SD). This method allows the development of a mathematical model that integrates sentiment analysis with technical momentum indicators through a cascade gate system. The mathematical formulation includes stochastic differential equations for price dynamics, Bayesian inference for sentiment analysis and multi-objective optimization for risk management. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the framework’s robustness across different market conditions, with Sharpe ratios consistently above 1.8. Findings The framework returns a complex decision-making output in order to reach an optimal choices pathway for derivative investments. The framework matches leading indicators relative strength index, lagging indicators (moving averages, moving average convergence/divergence [MACD]) and volume indicators on-balance volume with real-time sentiment analysis. Our computational implementation uses historical data from major cryptocurrency exchanges (2020–2024) to validate the theoretical model, achieving risk-adjusted returns of 23.7% annually with maximum drawdown limited to 8.2%. Research limitations/implications The present research is not without limitations. Among others, these include the appropriate software for the effective development of SD; information asymmetry that may arise during sentiment analysis via social networks; and the real-time availability of price and volume data for the optimal consideration of technical indicators. Practical implications From a practical perspective, the work can contribute to improving decision-making and risk management assessment based on integrated approaches that combine business choices with mathematical models and the development of enabling technologies such as AI. Moreover, this research can be useful to develop an updated regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies investments. This research addresses the critical make-or-buy decision facing cryptocurrency exchanges, providing a systematic approach to in-house derivative investment management with built-in risk controls and regulatory compliance features. Social implications From a social perspective, this study contributes to a better knowledge of the behavior of crypto-exchanges in the formulation that guides them in their choice regarding investments in derivatives. This aspect now involves millions of users globally. Originality/value This study contributes to several streams of research, including the decision-making process, risk management assessment and financial instruments. The paper also presents social and practical implications.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This research integrates cue utilization and psychological reactance to explore the impact of relative platform score (RPS), calculated as perceived platform score minus objective platform-generated score, on individuals’ behavioral intentions. Specifically, we examine how trial intention mediates the influence of RPS on recommendation intention. Additionally, we investigate the moderating role of proactivity in the relationship between RPS and trial intention. Design/methodology/approach Utilizing survey data from 359 sample customers who had utilized Chinese third-party review platforms, hierarchical and path analyses were conducted to analyze whether and how RPS positively impacts both trial intention and recommendation intention. Moreover, “PROCESS SPSS Macro” was used to test the mediating role of trial intention and the moderated mediation effect with proactivity as moderator. Findings Our findings indicate that RPS positively impacts both trial intention and recommendation intention, with the influence on recommendation intention being mediated by trial intention. Moreover, proactivity positively moderates the relationship between RPS and trial intention, thereby enhancing the indirect influence of RPS on recommendation intention through trial intention. Originality/value By elucidating the effect of RPS on behavioral intentions through the underlying mechanism of psychological reactance, we extend the existing research stream on third-party platform rating scores. Furthermore, we contribute novel insights to the research on proactivity by examining its moderating role in the relationship between RPS and trial intention.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract In course of investigating the endophytic and nematode-associated fungus Polydomus karssenii for the production of secondary metabolites, seven previously undescribed natural products were isolated from liquid and solid-state fermentations. 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, together with HR-ESI–MS data, enabled the elucidation of the planar structures of 3-decalinoyltetramic acids polydosetins A–E ( 1 – 5 ) and cyclodepsipeptides pullularins G and H ( 6 and 7 ). The relative configurations of the decalin moiety of 1 – 5 were determined based on ROESY correlations and 1 H– 1 H coupling constants. The configuration of the side chains was established through a detailed J -resolved analysis (Murata’s method) in combination with chemical shift comparison to model compounds. Absolute stereochemistry of 1 – 5 was assigned based on ECD data, and confirmed by Mosher’s method utilizing 3 . Finally, the absolute configuration of amino acid residues in 6 and 7 was determined through advanced Marfey’s method. Bioassays revealed that compounds 1 , 3 , 5 , and 7 were active against Gram-positive bacteria, 3 and 5 exhibited antifungal activity, and 1 and 2 showed nematicidal effects. These results underscore the untapped chemical potential of P. karssenii and highlight the importance of exploring nematode-associated fungi as sources of new natural products with potential antimicrobial and nematicidal properties.",

    "Abstract": "The Intelligent Road Side Unit (RSU) is a crucial component of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs), where roadside LiDAR are widely utilized for their high precision and resolution. However, water droplets and atmospheric particles in fog significantly attenuate and scatter LiDAR beams, posing a challenge to multi-target tracking and ITS safety. To enhance the accuracy and reliability of RSU-based tracking, a collaborative RSU method that integrates denoising and tracking for multi-target tracking is proposed. The proposed approach first dynamically adjusts the filtering kernel scale based on local noise levels to effectively remove noisy point clouds using a modified bilateral filter. Subsequently, a multi-RSU cooperative tracking framework is designed, which employs a particle Probability Hypothesis Density (PHD) filter to estimate target states via measurement fusion. A multi-target tracking system for intelligent RSUs in Foggy scenarios was designed and implemented. Extensive experiments were conducted using an intelligent roadside platform in real-world fog-affected traffic environments to validate the accuracy and real-time performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the target detection accuracy by 8% and 29%, respectively, compared to statistical filtering methods after removing fog noise under thin and thick fog conditions. At the same time, this method performs well in tracking multi-class targets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods, especially in high-order evaluation indicators such as HOTA, MOTA, and IDs.",

    "Abstract": "This study aimed to identify young school students’ language learning strategies (LLSs) within their diverse socio-linguistic reality. The study was conducted in one elementary school in a peripheral city characterized by a heterogeneous population (Arabs and Jews) and immigrants from various countries who speak multiple languages. The principal of this school opted to introduce young children (Grades 1 and 2) to four languages: Hebrew, as a socially dominant language; Russian and Arabic, as the children’s home languages; and English, as a global language. We used photo elicitation and dialogical conversation to obtain reflections of 11 Arab and Jewish students (Grade 2). Each student was asked to describe the strategies they used to learn a novel language in the classroom and at home. Findings support the appropriateness of Oxford’s taxonomy to young language learners: all LLSs’ categories were reported. This study contributes to our understanding of children’s ability to use LLSs in early primary school. It highlights the leading role of language teachers who seem to mediate by modelling LLSs. Furthermore, it enriches the understanding of how 7–8-year-old learners can use diverse metacognitive LLSs and transfer them across languages. We also found one “child-specific” characteristics of the strategy related to parental involvement.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose The increasing importance of knowledge management systems (KMS) as a source of competitive advantage and the recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) makes the question of appropriate integration of AI and human intelligence (HI) in KMS very pertinent. This paper aims to develop a framework that helps identify appropriate AI-HI integration in KMS for different structure, content and context-related parameters. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses an inductive approach that leverages Shneiderman (2020) framework to develop a hierarchical framework demonstrating the level of sophistication of AI and identifies an appropriate level for a firm given its structure, content and context-related characteristics. Findings The absent, assistive, augmented and automated (4A) model of AI integration has been developed, and the relevant structure, content and context-related variables of KMS have been identified. Using the 4A model, the appropriate AI level for an organization, considering multiple structure, content and context-related parameters is identified. Based on the model, efficiency and control are identified as the two principal objectives of KMS and the trade-off between them is elucidated. Originality/value To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper develops a new model to determine the appropriate level of AI and human interaction in KMS and demonstrates its applicability in multiple situations. The 4A model is applicable across other domains, besides KMS.",

    "Abstract": "The persistent increase in healthcare expenditure has become a major challenge for the sustainability of public financing worldwide. Therefore, identifying the characteristics of at-risk population and their predictability for healthcare use is crucial to inform targeted policy and interventions to curb with increasing healthcare use and expenditure. Drawing on three waves of the HILDA survey that included a 'health module', the study applied four machine learning (ML) methods-Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and multilayer perceptron neural networks and conventional logistic regression for prediction of non-emergency healthcare use (specifically primary and tertiary inpatient hospital care). Predictive performance for the classifiers was evaluated using accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity measures, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Calibration of the models was assessed using Brier score, which measures the mean squared difference between predicted probabilities and observed outcomes with lower values indicating better calibration. Finally, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) was conducted to explain the model's predictive behaviour, while SHAP results are provided for each wave along with a representative SHAP plot as a demonstration which uses the probability-contribution scale. Based on 47,899 observations and 741 variables, our model identified socio-economic factors (age, socio-economic status, private insurance status) and health-related variables (e.g. previous contact with healthcare service) and having a designated doctor to see when sick or for health advice were strong predictors of healthcare use. Between the different ML techniques, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees provided better prediction performance on healthcare use compared with logistic regression across all three waves. Although the standard logistic regression produced AUC of 0.69, had 71% positive predictive value (PPV), and 52% negative predictive value (NPV), with 86% sensitivity and 30% specificity, the ML models produced AUC in the range of 0.68 to 0.76, PPV of 75% to 77%, and NPVs of 61% to 63% with sensitivity ranging between 0.86 and 0.89, specificity between 0.40 and 0.44 and brier scores ranging between 0.11 and 0.28. The novelty of using ML techniques on a large, nationally representative longitudinal household survey data that covers a range of different domains provided more robust estimates on factors influencing future healthcare use (primary and inpatient elective care) which are important to inform resource allocation decisions and priority setting.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background and Objectives Vasovagal reactions (VVRs) are the common donor adverse reaction, especially in young and first‐time donors, affecting donor return. Despite evidence‐based physiological and psychological mitigation strategies (MSs), their awareness and implementation remain variable. This study aimed to assess the awareness and practice of VVR MSs across licensed blood centres in India. Materials and Methods A cross‐sectional online survey was conducted between January and March 2025. A pre‐validated questionnaire was distributed via a Google Form link. Data included demographic details of respondents, centre type, annual collection and voluntary donors. It was also focused on awareness, types and usage of VVR MSs. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, and associations were tested using χ 2 and logistic regression. This survey was reported in accordance with the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E‐Surveys (CHERRIES) guidelines. Results Of 4153 blood centres, 439 were included in the final analysis, having fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among them, 370/439 (84.3%) were aware of VVR MSs, while only 298/439 (67.9%) implemented them. Water/fluid ingestion was the most common physiological strategy (254/268, 94.8%), followed by applied muscle tension (110/268, 41.1%). Among psychological strategies, primarily audiovisual distraction combined with psychosocial support was reported by 143/210 (68.1%) centres. Of the 298 centres, 213 (71.5%) offered special attention to high‐risk donors, 205 (68.8%) focused on delayed VVR prevention and 132 (44.3%) had dedicated counsellors. Conclusion Despite good awareness, implementation of VVR MSs in Indian blood centres remains inconsistent. Nationwide policy, awareness programmes and structured training could promote uniform, evidence‐based donor care and improve donor safety and retention.",

    "Abstract": "This research explores the connection between religious culture and carbon emissions through the lens of informal institutions, offering valuable insights into the shift to a green economy in China. The research sample comprises listed enterprises from 2010–2020 to investigate the influence of indigenous religious culture, represented by Buddhism and Taoism, on the corporate carbon footprint. The results reveal that religious culture has a notable inhibitory effect on corporate carbon outputs. Through a suite of robustness checks, the findings remain in line with the benchmark results. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the effect of religious culture on corporate carbon emissions is more noticeable in economically thriving areas, state-owned companies, polluting-intensive companies, capital-intensive companies, and high-tech companies. Mechanistic tests suggest that religious culture mainly reduces corporate carbon emissions through three pathways: promoting corporate social responsibility, alleviating corporate financing constraints, and increasing corporate green innovation. Research has shown that both formal institutions and foreign cultural impacts weaken the beneficial impact of indigenous religious culture on corporate carbon reduction but do not eliminate its effect. This study provides practical guidelines and theoretical references for enterprises and policy-makers in addressing climate change and achieving sustainable development.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Lattice materials offer extraordinary opportunities for lightweight structural design, yet their practical application is often compromised by their propensity for brittle fracture originating from inherent defects. This study introduces a novel design strategy to overcome this limitation by incorporating nonlocal interactions into the lattice architecture. We investigate the fracture mechanics of two-dimensional lattice materials with and without nonlocal connections through a combination of finite element analysis and a node-based homogenization method. Our theoretical model accurately predicts the crack-tip displacement field, revealing significant deviations from classical continuum mechanics. The results strikingly demonstrate that nonlocal lattices exhibit superior stiffness, strength, and fracture toughness compared to their local counterparts. An energy-based analysis unveils the core toughening mechanism: nonlocal interactions effectively redistribute stress at the crack tip, leading to the formation of a larger plastic zone. This enhanced plasticity not only delays crack initiation by increasing the required energy for fracture but also elevates crack growth resistance by dissipating more energy during propagation. This work elucidates the fundamental role of nonlocality in enhancing fracture performance and provides a robust framework for designing tough, defect-tolerant lattice materials for high-performance applications.",

    "Abstract": "The present study experimentally investigates the onset of ventilation of surface-piercing hydrofoils. Under steady-state conditions, the depth-based Froude number $\\textit{Fr}$ and the angle of attack $\\alpha$ define regions in which distinct flow regimes are either locally or globally stable. To map the boundary between these stability regions, the parameter space $(\\alpha , \\textit{Fr})$ was systematically surveyed by increasing $\\alpha$ until the onset of ventilation while maintaining a constant $\\textit{Fr}$ . Two simplified model hydrofoils were examined: a semi-ogive with a blunt trailing edge and a modified NACA 0010-34. Tests were conducted in a towing tank under quasi-steady-state conditions for aspect ratios of $1.0$ and $1.5$ , and for $\\textit{Fr}$ ranging from $0.5$ to $2.5$ . Ventilation occurred spontaneously for all test conditions as $\\alpha$ increased. Three distinct trigger mechanisms were identified: nose, tail and base ventilation. Nose ventilation is prevalent at $\\textit{Fr} \\lt 1.0$ and $\\textit{Fr} \\lt 1.25$ for aspect ratios of $1.0$ and $1.5$ , respectively, and is associated with an increase in the inception angle of attack. Tail ventilation becomes prevalent at higher $\\textit{Fr}$ , and the inception angle of attack exhibits a negative trend. Base ventilation was only observed for the semi-ogive profile, but it did not lead to the development of a stable ventilated cavity. Notably, the measurements indicate that the boundary between bistable and globally stable regions is not uniform and extends to significantly higher $\\alpha$ than previously estimated. A revised stability map is proposed to reconcile previously published and current data, demonstrating how two alternative paths to a steady-state condition can lead to different flow regimes.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The rapid evolution of Industry 4.0 necessitates that engineering education equips students with skills that bridge traditional instrumentation and modern data‐driven analytics. This paper addresses this need by presenting a comprehensive project‐based learning module that fuses LabVIEW‐based virtual instrumentation with machine learning (ML) for teaching industrial condition monitoring. Implemented in a senior‐level undergraduate course, the module tasks student teams with diagnosing the health of an industrial fan. Using the NI ELVIS educational platform instrumented with an accelerometer, students acquire real‐time vibration data. A key innovation is the seamless integration of LabVIEW, used for data acquisition and visualization, with a Python‐based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which classifies the fan's condition (normal, minor, or severe malfunction) and rotational speed. The technical implementation achieved high classification accuracy (exceeding 95% on test data) and low inference latency (approximately 0.1 s), demonstrating the feasibility of real‐time ML deployment. Pedagogically, the project provided an authentic, interdisciplinary learning experience, enhancing student understanding of vibration analysis, sensor integration, and the practical application of deep learning. The module successfully demonstrates a scalable framework for incorporating AI into engineering laboratories, effectively preparing students for roles that require synthesizing physical system knowledge with intelligent algorithm deployment.",

    "Abstract": "An interconnected loop of messages and counter-messages determine the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. Multihost pathogenicity across plants and animals, particularly nematode, is a major source of new infectious diseases. <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i>, a multihost pathogen, causes vascular wilt in chickpea and fusariosis in worm and humans. To comprehend <i>Fusarium</i>-responsive multihost pathogenicity, we temporally profiled cross-kingdom species, chickpea and worm using SWATH-mass spectrometry. Morphological analyses revealed that increased wilting and intestinal disintegration elicits a disease response in chickpea and worm. Peptide-spectrum library consisted of 5629 and 3138 proteins from <i>Fusarium</i> infected chickpea and worm, respectively. SWATH analysis identified 1573 and 2249 disease-responsive chickpea (CaDRPs) and worm proteins (CeDRPs) linked to diverse organs, organelles, and functionality. Pairwise comparisons; over-representation analysis between time, treatment, and organism; wilt, and fusariosis diseasome revealed common and unique modules. CaDRPs involved in preformed defense, biomolecule synthesis, phytohormone regulation, ser/thr kinase, and ATP signaling have perturbed interactions and functions, majorly in chloroplast. CeDRPs linked to the cuticular support, muscle organization, neuronal information, intestinal metabolism, G-protein, and notch signaling showed a deregulated function, especially in the cytoplasm. Common biological processes, included primary metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, calcium signaling, and proteostasis. Our data provide first evidence of translational plasticity in the <i>Fusarium</i> diseasome providing novel insights into multihost pathogenesis.",

    "Abstract": "The Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KS) equation and its fractional generalizations (FKSs) arise as canonical models for a wide class of nonlinear dissipative–dispersive systems, including thin-film flows, combustion fronts, drift–wave turbulence in plasmas, and chemically reacting media, where shock-like and strongly localized structures play a central role in the dynamics. Despite their apparent simplicity, KS-type models become analytically intractable once higher-order dissipation, geometric effects, and memory (fractional) operators are incorporated, and standard perturbative or transform-based schemes often lead to cumbersome recursive structures, slow convergence, or severe restrictions on the initial data. In this work, a novel direct approximation procedure, referred to as the Tantawy Technique (TT), is developed and implemented to solve and analyze planar fractional KS-type equations and their Burgers-type reductions in a systematic manner. The central difficulty is to construct, for a given physically motivated initial profile, a rapidly convergent series in fractional time that remains stable for a broad range of the fractional order and transport coefficients, while still retaining a clear link to the underlying shock-wave physics. To overcome this, the TT combines (i) a Tanh-based exact shock solution of the planar integer-order KS equation, obtained first as a reference via the standard Tanh method, with (ii) a carefully designed fractional-time ansatz in powers of tρ, where the spatial coefficients are determined recursively from the governing equation in the Caputo sense. This construction yields closed-form expressions for the first few terms in the approximation hierarchy and allows one to monitor convergence through residual and absolute error measures.",

    "Abstract": "Fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons provide precisely timed, context-dependent inhibition within cortical circuits. PV neuron firing properties are specialized among cortical neurons, suggesting that they express a unique complement of ion channels. Here, we show that the PV-specific silent voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel subunit Kv6.4 (encoded by Kcng4 ) modulates both intrinsic and synaptic properties of cortical PV neurons. Kv6.4 does not form functional channels on its own but, as shown in prior work, assembles with Kv2 subunits to create heterotetrameric channel complexes, effectively reducing Kv2-mediated delayed rectifier current. We find that Kcng4 expression is enriched within a distinct Pvalb -expressing subclass in primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex and emerges during postnatal development. In PV neurons, Kv6.4 loss reduces action potential (AP) height and width, hyperpolarizes the threshold and interspike potential, and accelerates AP upstroke particularly during repetitive firing. Kv6.4 loss, potentially due to the changes in AP waveform, also alters GABA release and paired-pulse depression at synapses made by PV onto pyramidal (PYR) neurons. The effects of Kv6.4 loss are amplified during high-frequency firing, within the physiological range of fast-spiking PV neurons, likely due to altered repolarization dynamics that accumulate across successive APs. These findings are thus consistent with the function of Kv6.4 in modifying Kv2-mediated delayed rectifier currents. Hence, Kv6.4 tunes the temporal precision of PV inhibitory output, a feature that may be critical for stable excitation–inhibition ratios and adaptive circuit function underlying learning and behavior.",

    "Abstract": "Self-healing hydrogels are advanced materials that can restore their original functionality and properties after mechanical damage, either through intrinsic mechanisms or via external stimuli. However, their widespread application is often limited by challenges such as insufficient mechanical strength, low thermal stability, and inadequate self-healing efficiency. In this study, we developed a novel self-healing hydrogel based on salep. This natural polysaccharide was modified through free radical polymerization using two distinct polymers: polyacrylamide (PAM) and poly)diallyldimethylammonium( chloride (PDADMAC). Additionally, Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) were synthesized and incorporated into the hydrogel matrix, imparting magnetic responsiveness. The resulting semi-interpenetrating (semi-IPN) hydrogel network exhibited robust self-healing properties, attributed to dynamic, reversible hydrogen bonds within the polymer chains. The inclusion of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> MNPs further facilitated the mobility of polymer chains under an external magnetic field, significantly improving the efficiency and rate of self-repair. The PAM-modified nanocomposite hydrogel achieved an equilibrium swelling ratio of ~ 2300%, while the PDADMAC-based composite reached ~ 1875% at pH = 7. Notably, the semi-IPN structure endowed the hydrogel with self-healing, enabling it to recover its original mechanical integrity within 35 min at room temperature. Combining a natural salep matrix with synthetic polymer networks and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> MNPs produced a self-healing hydrogel with markedly improved strength, stability, and functionality. The dynamic hydrogen-bonded network ensures rapid, autonomous repair, while the magnetic component provides tunable responsiveness under external fields. These features, together with High tensile properties and antimicrobial efficacy, suggest broad applicability in biomedical, agricultural, and environmental technologies.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The Indian craft sector, one of the world's largest decentralized creative economies, embodies complex intersections of culture, livelihood, and commerce. Yet, existing scholarship and policy discourse remain fragmented, focusing narrowly on heritage preservation or isolated market interventions. This study develops a conceptual typology of business models within the Indian craft ecosystem by integrating distinction between instrumental and substantive value logics with framework of governance modes. Using a conceptual–analytical design grounded in secondary case analysis of representative enterprises, such as Fabindia, SEWA, Jaipur Rugs, KVIC, Raghurajpur, and GoCoop, the paper identifies six ideal‐type models: market‐oriented, cooperative and cluster‐based, value‐based hybrid models, state‐supported policy‐driven, experience‐driven and club‐good, and digital and post‐globalization models. The typology reveals how plural economic logics coexist through hybrid governance and evolving digital interfaces. The study contributes to cultural‐entrepreneurship and ecosystem literature by reconceptualizing crafts as a plural economy rather than a residual informal sector. It also provides actionable insights for policymakers and entrepreneurs seeking to align cultural sustainability with market viability. The framework offers a basis for comparative research across creative industries in emerging economies and invites empirical validation through longitudinal and mixed‐method approaches.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract This article presents the first comprehensive empirical analysis of the mainstream music in Slovenia, a small and peripheral music market shaped by global trends and regional pop-cultural history. Drawing on survey data on musical preferences (2021) and radio airplays from 2017 to 2022, the study combines big data methodologies with a reflexive theoretical approach about mainstream music as a meta-genre. The findings expose the relational structure of audience taste, revealing genre clusters that reflect cultural divides between global and local, and a dual mainstream formation in the radio’s airplay: one driven by seasonal, high-rotation global hits, and another composed of canonized domestic and regional evergreens. This layered formation illustrates how institutional repetition and audience selection reproduce the status quo in contemporary cultural industries, while constraining aesthetic innovation, marginalizing younger local artists, and reinforcing generational divides within the Slovenian music landscape.",

    "Abstract": "Two new species of Pyragraphorus Sproston, 1946 (Mazocraeidea: Pyragraphoridae) were collected from the gills of carangid fishes: Pyragraphorus rohdei n. sp. from Trachinotus baillonii (Lacépède) off Lizard Island, Queensland, Australia, and Pyragraphorus ningalooensis n. sp. from Trachinotus botla (Shaw) from Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, Australia, during June 2022 and March 2023. Pyragraphorus was reviewed, its diagnosis emended, and the new species described and compared with their congeners, Pyragraphorus pyragraphorus (MacCallum and MacCallum, 1913) Sproston, 1946, and Pyragraphorus hollisae Euzet and Ktari, 1970. The identification of specimens reported by Young as P. pyragraphorus from T. botla in Moreton Bay, Queensland, was corrected to P. ningalooensis. A phylogenetic hypothesis was reconstructed, on the basis of an analysis of partial 28S rDNA, including novel molecular data from the new species and from new collections of Heteromicrocotyloides megaspinosus Barton, Beaufrère, Justine, and Whittington, 2009, and Heteromicrocotyloides mirabilis Rohde, 1977 (both Heteromicrocotylidae) from Turrum fulvoguttatum (Forsskål), together with available comparable data for 76 other species representing 18 families of the order Mazocraeidea. The novel hypothesis indicated that the Pyragraphoridae and Heteromicrocotylidae, both characterized, in part, by species possessing fire-tongs-like haptoral clamps, originated independently in a larger, highly supported clade of the order that included species of the Heteraxinidae and the Microcotylidae. The Heteromicrocotylidae was found to be polyphyletic by Heterapta heterapta Unnithan, 1961, occurring independently of the 2 species of Heteromicrocotyloides. In addition, the Microcotylidae was recovered paraphyletic to the Pyragraphoridae and the Heteraxinidae was paraphyletic to the Heteromicrocotylidae. Other instances of para- and polyphyly among the familial and subfamilial taxa within the Mazocraeidea were suggested, but no family-group taxonomic changes were proposed.",

    "Abstract": "Background Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are associated with the prognosis of various types of adult cancers. However, the expressions and prognosis of BMPs in pediatric neuroblastoma remain unclear. Methods Six publicly available neuroblastoma cohorts were downloaded for bioinformatics analysis. The prognosis of BMPs in neuroblastoma was determined using cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Results Our study revealed that, compared to other BMP family members, BMP1, BMP7 and BMP8B were highly expressed in neuroblastoma. However, only BMP7 was associated with the prognosis of neuroblastoma in all six neuroblastoma cohorts. Higher BMP7 expression was associated with the shorted event free survival and overall survival of neuroblastoma. The prognosis of BMP7 in neuroblastoma was independent of age and MYCN amplification. The expressions of BMP7 were higher in neuroblastoma patients with MYCN amplification or age ≥ 18months or in stage 4 neuroblastoma. Moreover, higher BMP7 was associated with the shorted event free survival and overall survival of MYCN amplified or stage 4 neuroblastoma. At last, we found that breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 (BRMS1) was correlated with BMP7 expression. However, in contrast with the suppressor role of BRMS1 in adult cancers, BRMS1 was significantly associated with the unfavorable clinical outcomes of neuroblastoma. Overall, our analysis the demonstrated correlations between BMPs and clinical features of neuroblastoma and provided unique therapeutic targets for neuroblastoma treatments. Conclusions BMP7 was a prognostic maker of neuroblastoma.",

    "Abstract": "In the elastic scattering angular distributions of nuclei, the secondary rainbow manifests itself as an extra maximum (accompanied with a minimum as well) in the darkside of the primary rainbow. This phenomenon was first observed in the elastic scattering of [Formula: see text]O+[Formula: see text]C at around 300[Formula: see text]MeV. It is believed to be generated by the coupling to the first 2[Formula: see text] excitation of [Formula: see text]C and influenced by the couplings to other inelastic scattering channels. In this work, the optical potentials with a spline real part were utilized in the optical model analyses of the elastic scattering data of [Formula: see text]O+[Formula: see text]C at 300[Formula: see text]MeV and 330[Formula: see text]MeV. The spline real potentials were obtained by performing the data fitting starting from the phenomenological Woods–Saxon form and the double folding one, respectively. Through this approach, the secondary rainbow patterns of the two systems were reproduced well. The obtained spline real potentials exhibit an evident additional refraction (a potential pocket) at around [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]fm and show a preference to the shallow central depth. The semiclassical analyses were performed to learn the physical meaning of these obtained optical potentials. According to the nearside/farside decomposition, this secondary rainbow pattern was shown as the result of the farside scattering. In the deflection functions, a new minimum appears apart from the primary rainbow one, of which the former was proved to be related to the secondary rainbow maximum in the angular distribution. The potential pocket around [Formula: see text][Formula: see text]fm in the real potential was found responsible for the generation of the secondary rainbow pattern. However, the additional refraction caused by this potential pocket might not be associated with the Airy pattern. The present physical picture of the nuclear primary/secondary rainbow pattern is a two-refraction process originating from the non-monotonic repulsive-attractive real potential. Hence, the secondary rainbow pattern in the angular distribution corresponds to a complicated interference of the farside trajectories which distorts the original Airy oscillation pattern. Besides, for the phenomenological analysis of this pattern, a potential ambiguity was also found in the undulations of the real potential.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT In the colonic mucosal tissues of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), the levels of resolvin D5 (RvD5), a specialized pro‐resolving mediator, are significantly reduced and negatively correlate with disease severity. Whether RvD5 can ameliorate UC remain unclear. Here, we show that exogenous supplement of RvD5 remarkably reduces neutrophil infiltration within the colonic mucosal epithelial layers and alleviates dextran sulfate sodium‐induced colitis in mice. Adoptive transfer of neutrophils significantly attenuates the alleviation of RvD5 against colitis, indicating that inhibition of neutrophil infiltration plays a crucial role in the anti‐colitis effect. Mechanistically, RvD5 activates GPR101 in colonic epithelial cells to selectively downregulate CXCL8 expression through inhibiting pSTAT1 expression and thereby suppressing neutrophil infiltration within colonic mucosal epithelial layer, and GPR101 knockdown attenuates the above‐mentioned effect of RvD5. Based on molecular docking screening from natural product library, epimedin A1 is identified as a novel enhancer of RvD5 biosynthesis in M2 macrophages, which functions through allosteric inhibition of 5‐lipoxygenase (5‐LOX). Epimedin A1 significantly elevates RvD5 levels in colonic tissue, suppresses CXCL8 expression in colonic epithelial cells, and reduces mucosal epithelial neutrophil infiltration in colitis mice. In summary, RvD5 and its biosynthesis promoter epimedin A1 are promising as therapeutic agents of UC.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to examine whether individuals engaging in high-load resistance training (RT) make any exercise modifications during the first trimester of pregnancy, and describe pelvic floor health, fertility history, and obstetrical characteristics. Methods: Individuals &lt;20 weeks’ gestation who regularly engaged in RT during the first trimester were recruited and completed surveys related to preconception and first trimester pelvic health, fertility, menstrual health, relative energy deficiency in sport, and exercise behaviors. Training logs from three months preconception, until 12 weeks of gestation were obtained from a subset of individuals. Results: 359 participants, mean age 32.3 years (+/- 3.6 years), completed surveys. From preconception to the first trimester, the frequency of training decreased (4.8 days +/- 1.0 days pre-pregnancy vs 4.0 +/-1.3 days in first trimester, t= 11.45, p&lt;0.01). Most individuals continued Olympic weightlifting (n=127/159, 80%) and core exercises (n=214/234, 92%), with over half increased or maintained the load of RT (n=126/203, 62%). Fatigue and nausea reportedly impacted exercise behaviour in 77% of participants. Rates of previous miscarriage were similar to the general population. Only 15% of participants were given counselling on exercise through miscarriage (10/68 participants). Ten individuals (3%) reported a miscarriage during enrolment in the current study. Pelvic floor complaints during exercise reduced significantly from preconception to trimester one, irrespective of whether training load was reduced or maintained. Forty-one athletes provided preconception and pregnancy training logs. In this subset of athletes, their working load was maintained from preconception across the first trimester at &gt;75% of estimated one-repetition maximums. Conclusions: Continued participation of RT in the first trimester was well tolerated by those participating in RT preconception.",

    "Abstract": "Achieving environmentally friendly, green, and non-toxic marine antifouling has long been a development goal of the modern coatings industry. However, in complex marine environments, non-toxic or low-toxic antifouling coatings often have a significantly reduced service life. Therefore, achieving stable antifouling performance on a low-toxic basis has always been a goal in this industry. By using fluorocarbon resin with low surface energy and spraying a well-mixed blend of alkaline earth metal oil-absorbing nanowires and nano zinc oxide particles that is under high pressure, half-embedded into the resin, and infiltrated with alkanes, the antifouling mechanism of these coatings is achieved by the slow release of oily components, creating a long-lasting liquid–liquid interface to separate biofouling from the coating. Thanks to this antifouling mechanism, the sample maintains a water contact angle of 100–110° for 42 days in static seawater, achieves over 98% resistance to bacterial adhesion, and reaches 99.9% resistance to protein and algae adhesion. This study provides a novel and promising solution for the strict implementation of low-toxic and harmless antifouling.",

The flora of this region has been considered to have its strongest affinities with other warm‐water regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, with very low levels of endemism. Many of the taxa from the region have been known from three or fewer collections, and previously many were only identified to genus as key morphological, and anatomical features required for species‐level identifications were not available, and there were few species for which sequence data were available. Three of the new species, belonging to the genera Codium, Delisea , and Pyropia , were previously reported from Rangitāhua under other names. Sequence data have revealed them to differ from species from mainland New Zealand and the wider Pacific, and they are currently considered to be endemic to the region. The discovery of a new species of the New Zealand endemic genus Psilophycus, also confirmed by sequence data, is of particular interest given the genus has been regarded as monotypic and endemic to the northern North Island of New Zealand.

    "Abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) combine a tumor antigen-specific monoclonal antibody with a cytotoxic payload via a linker, allowing selective delivery of cytotoxic agents to cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. This approach has revolutionized cancer treatment. However, despite these advantages, resistance to ADCs has emerged as a significant barrier to long-term efficacy. Understanding and overcoming ADC resistance is crucial, especially for cancers with limited treatment options like triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Moreover, as ADCs expand into new therapeutic areas, overcoming resistance is essential to preserve their effectiveness and explore novel settings, including combination therapies. Identifying molecular pathways involved in ADC resistance and addressing these mechanisms can benefit more patients and extend ADCs' therapeutic lifespan. This review focuses on elucidating these pathways and explores innovative strategies to overcome resistance, including combination therapies and the development of next-generation ADCs. We also highlight key preclinical studies, bridging the gap between basic research and clinical applications, to provide a comprehensive understanding of ADC resistance and its impact on future cancer treatments.",

The mechanisms driving uveitis development in JIA remain understudied. Here, we demonstrate that peripheral blood CD19 + IgD - CD27 - double negative type 1 (DN1) B cells are elevated in JIA-uveitis compared to JIA patients without eye disease (JIA). The B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire was also more clonal and somatically hypermutated in JIA-uveitis and antigen-activated B cells infiltrated chronically inflamed JIA-uveitis eyes. Features of heightened B cell activation were recapitulated in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) and disrupting B and T cell interactions using monoclonal antibodies and transgenic mice suppresses uveitis. Together, these findings support a conceptual shift that uveitis is a primarily T cell driven disease and provide evidence for potential new therapeutic strategies that also consider B cells as drivers in disease pathology.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT The combinatorial explosion inherent to multi‐component systems limits their experimental exploration and ultimately chemical discovery. Here, we introduce a statistics‐based group‐testing strategy, which we couple with luminescence quenching assays to efficiently identify cooperative molecular interactions. Utilizing the quenching of a photosensitizer as a quick readout for chemical activity, 4,950 substrate pairs were screened in only 504 experiments, enabled through a combinatorial design theory‐based pooling approach and iterative deconvolution. Therefore, two algorithms—a greedy algorithm for group design and an iterative sectioning deconvolution method to resolve active pairs—were implemented. Fifteen cooperative pairs were identified, and the nature of their interactions and the resulting electronic perturbations were investigated. In a systematic follow‐up screen, it was found that the identified active pairs exhibit high reactivity towards a broad group of reaction partners. One such pair led to the discovery of a bench‐stable reagent, enabling efficient and regioselective trifluoromethylthiolation reactions.

    "Abstract": "(1) Objective: To compare the marginal and internal fit of 3D-printed and milled three-unit fixed dental prostheses (FDPs) made from tetragonal zirconia polycrystal (3Y-TZP). (2) Methods: Three-unit FDPs were designed for a typodont maxillary model with crown preparation for the second premolar and second molar. Nominal cement gap widths were set to 30 µm at the margins and 80 µm internally. A total of 40 FDPs (n = 10/group) differing in wall thickness (w = 0.6/1.0 mm) and support structures (with/without a stiffening frame) were fabricated from 3Y-TZP by 3D printing. A total of 10 milled FDPs with w = 0.6 mm served as a control group. After adhesive cementation on the respective replicated maxillary models, FDPs were sectioned and the cement gap dimension was assessed with a digital microscope. The marginal and internal fit found for the different test groups were compared using non-parametric tests. (3) Results: The best marginal fit—qualified by median/ maximum marginal gap width—was given for milled FDPs (79/127 µm vertical; 85/171 µm tangential), whereas the marginal fit of 3D-printed FDPs with w = 0.6 mm and regular support structures was the worst (144/284 µm vertical; 107/198 µm tangential). Use of an additional support frame improved the marginal fit of 3D-printed FDPs, in particular FDPs with w = 0.6 mm (108/197 µm vertical; 87/161 µm tangential). (4) Conclusions: 3D-printed zirconia FDPs showed conditionally comparable marginal and internal fit as their milled counterparts, but with slightly higher scattering. When fabricating thinner 3D-printed FDPs, additional support structures are mandatory to achieve clinically well-fitting restorations.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose: This study aimed to assess: 1) the concurrent validity between critical power (CP) and the corrected power output at the respiratory compensation point (PO RCP ) and between W’ and the quantity of energy depleted above PO RCP (W’ mod-SRS ) in a modified Step-Ramp-Step (mod-SRS) protocol; 2) the test-retest reliability of endurance variables derived from a mod-SRS protocol. Methods: Twelve trained male triathletes (31 ± 6 yr, 67.9 ± 7.1 mL.min -1 .kg -1 ) performed i) a SRS protocol, ii) 4 to 5 severe-intensity Constant-Work Rate (CWR) trials, iii) two mod-SRS protocols (test/re-test) and iv) a heavy-intensity CWR trial. CP and W’ were computed using a “best individual fit” approach. PO RCP was corrected appropriately while W’ mod-SRS was computed as the energy depleted above PO RCP . Test-retest reliability was assessed with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), the standard error of measurement (SEM) and the coefficient of variation (CV%). Results: CP was higher than PO RCP in both trials (bias = 19 ± 19 W and 17 ± 20 W, p = 0.019 and 0.045). W’ and W’ mod-SRS were similar between trials (bias = -2.8 ± 7.9 kJ and -5.4 ± 8.8 kJ, p = 0.735 and 0.173). Test-retest reliability was moderate for W’ mod-SRS (ICC = 0.66, SEM = 3.0 kJ, CV = 11.6%) and high for V̇O 2peak , GET, RCP and their associated PO values (ICCs = 0.85-0.95, SEMs = 68-184 mL.min -1 and 7-8W, CVs = 2.1-3.7%). Conclusions: The mod-SRS protocol reliably measures V̇O 2peak , GET and RCP. Corrected PO RCP systematically underestimated CP, which consequently impacts computation of W’ using a mod-SRS protocol. The design of the protocol may allow a more complete depletion of energy available above RCP while still eliciting V̇O 2peak .",

    "Abstract": "Objectives: Otitis media (OM) is a significant health concern, particularly among Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children who experience one of the highest rates of OM globally. This study aimed to evaluate the use and differences of wideband absorbance at ambient pressure (WBA) among urban Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander and non-Aboriginal children with suspected OM based on standard tympanometry. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study in Perth, Western Australia, recruiting children from both tertiary and community-based healthcare settings. A total of 53 children (106 ears) were included in this study, of which 30 children (60 ears) were Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (mean age 4.67 ± 3.76, range: 0.59 to 14.96 years) and 23 children (46 ears) were non-Aboriginal (mean age 3.94 ± 1.53, range: 1.93 to 6.01 years). Each child underwent an audiological assessment, which included otoscopy, single-frequency tympanometry, WBA, otoacoustic emissions, and age-appropriate audiometry. Audiologist examination and interpretation of standard audiological results served as the reference standard for a suspected OM diagnosis. Results: WBA analysis was performed on 104 ears, of which 30 ears were diagnosed with suspected OM using single-frequency tympanometry results. When comparing ears, mean WBA was similar between non-Aboriginal children and Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children without suspected OM at all frequencies ( p &gt; 0.05). Mean WBA was significantly reduced between 500 and 4000 Hz in all children with suspected OM, with a peak difference at 1600 Hz observed between groups ( p &lt; 0.001). Overall, WBA was more reduced in Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children with suspected OM compared with non-Aboriginal children with suspected OM, the only significant difference was observed at 800 Hz ( p = 0.037). Conclusions: For this sample of children living in an urban area, WBA is significantly reduced in the ears of children with suspected OM compared with those children with healthy middle ears. Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children without suspected OM show comparable WBA results to non-Aboriginal children with normal ears. However, Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children with suspected OM exhibit lower overall WBA than their non-Aboriginal peers with OM, with a significant difference observed at 800 Hz. These findings support previous research that suggests WBA may be a valuable tool in detecting OM, particularly in high-risk populations. Further research is needed to investigate the factors contributing to reduced WBA in Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children with OM and to validate WBA’s potential in addressing the under-detection of OM in this population.",

    "Abstract": "In Europe, the beetle tribe Leptodirini (Coleoptera, Leiodidae) reaches its highest diversity in southern parts of the continent, where this predominantly subterranean group developed into one of the largest subterranean radiations in the World. Within this belt, encompassing Iberian Peninsula, Italian Preapls and Balkan Peninsula, the highest species diversity is reached in the North-western Balkan’s Dinaric Karst. Ever since the scientific description of the first subterranean beetle species, Leptodirus hochenwartii Schmidt, 1832 in the North-western Dinarides, numerous discoveries and publications accumulated up to present. These records have been systematically gathered in the Slovenian SubBioLab’s database SubBioDB; however, they were previously not publicly available. Herein, we present the dataset on Western Balkan’s Leptodirini and provide some of its basic characteristics. We present the first comprehensive dataset of published records of the tribe Leptodirini in the North-western Balkans, covering primarily the Dinaric Karst and adjacent areas of the Southern Calcareous Alps and the Albanides. The dataset includes 5,535 records compiled from 333 literature sources representing 334 species with 176 subspecies. All records were georeferenced with the highest possible spatial precision. Using published data, we provide checklists of species and subspecies for included countries, a consolidated bibliography of all publications containing Leptodirini records, spatial maps highlighting the areas of highest taxa richness and an overview of the number of records, sites and range sizes for each species and subspecies across the study area. This dataset provides a foundation for future research and sampling campaigns in the region, as well as a spatially-explicit resource for investigating the diversity and distribution of Leptodirini in Europe’s largest karst area.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Studies have shown that organisms may adjust metabolic rates in response to thermal variability, highlighting metabolic plasticity as a key adaptive mechanism. Understanding the extent of metabolic plasticity of an organism is key to predicting its adaptation to climate change. In birds, the embryos from the uniparentally incubating species are more frequently exposed to intermittent cooling due to the parents' repeated absences from the nest than the embryos from the species with biparental incubation. Such pressure may favour them to evolve a better ability to cope with the physiologically suppressive effects of low temperatures and temperature fluctuations. We compared embryonic heart rate, a proxy for embryonic metabolic rate, and its response to egg temperature change between two closely related species, the biparentally incubating Black‐throated Tit ( Aegithalos concinnus ) and the uniparentally incubating Silver‐throated Tit ( Aegithalos glaucogularis ). We also conducted an interspecific egg‐swapping experiment to investigate the effect of incubation environment on embryonic metabolism and its consequences (i.e. incubation period length and hatching success). Consistent with the expectation, Silver‐throated Tit exhibited a trend (although nonsignificant) of higher embryonic heart rate than Black‐throated Tit. Also, when egg temperatures dropped, Silver‐throated Tit showed a significantly slower decrease in embryonic heart rate than Black‐throated Tit, suggesting that they may better cope with temperature drop. In the egg‐swapping experiment, embryonic heart rates did not differ significantly between fostered and not‐fostered eggs, but following fostering, heart rates tended to decrease in Silver‐throated Tit embryos and increase in Black‐throated Tit embryos, suggesting that embryos of both species show some responsiveness to new thermal environments. Egg‐fostering treatment did not affect hatching success in either species, but the fostered eggs of Silver‐throated Tits and Black‐throated Tits tended to shorten and lengthen their incubation period, respectively, implying that the relatively stable biparental incubation environment may facilitate faster embryonic development than the more variable uniparental incubation environment. The findings enhance our understanding of the developmental strategies and responsiveness to changed environments in avian embryos under different parental care modes and provide insights into their potential to respond to climate change.

It is essential they have access to evidence-based resources that can enhance their adjustment. During the development of the Spinal Cord Injury Health Maintenance Tool preliminary lived experience feedback highlighted the need to include an additional module on mental health. Study design Qualitative study. Objectives To co-design a new Mental Health module with people with spinal cord injury during the digitisation of the Spinal Cord Injury Health Maintenance Tool. Setting Community in Sydney, Australia. Methods A focus group of four participants with lived experience and expert review process performed collaboratively with a spinal cord injury key informant group. Results Four key informants engaged in the collaboration. Four key themes summarised how this second round of lived experience progressed the mental health resource: 1) Mental health is front and centre highlighted the necessity of including mental health in any self-management plan for spinal cord injury; 2) Striking the right balance acknowledged the serious impact of mental health issues but without undue negativity; 3) The glass is half full emphasised the need for a greater focus on a strengths-based approach; and 4) Variety’s the spice of life required the Mental Health module to respond to individual circumstances. Conclusions Lived experience feedback ensured that the tone, scope and content of this module were revised to place greater emphasis on a strengths-based orientation, while still acknowledging the serious and severe outcomes associated with compromised mental health.",

    "Abstract": "OBJECTIVE Therapeutic hypothermia within 6 hours of birth is critical for newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) but is often delayed by transfers to appropriate facilities. Telemedicine (TM) based hypothermia evaluation could expedite these assessments. There is limited evidence on the efficacy of TM compared with the in-person (IP) Sarnat examination. In this study, we aim to compare the TM with the IP examination in infants with suspected HIE. METHODS Newborns were enrolled from March 2022 to December 2023. All infants underwent IP and TM assessments using the modified Sarnat examination within 6 hours after birth. Data included neurologic examination scores for both IP and TM, decisions for hypothermia qualification, and TM technology metrics. Cohen’s kappa statistic (κ) was used to measure the interrater agreement between IP and TM examination findings. RESULTS 170 Sarnat assessments (IP and TM) were performed on 85 enrolled infants. The results show almost perfect agreement between IP and TM regarding signs of moderate or severe HIE (κ = 0.82) and the decision for hypothermia intervention (κ = 0.82). We report fair to moderate agreement (κ = 0.33–0.58) for individual categories of the neurologic examination. 93% of TM examinations were completed within 15 minutes, and 79% of the TM encounters had no technology issues. CONCLUSIONS This study compares IP and TM assessments in infants requiring hypothermia evaluation. Findings show that TM is feasible and not significantly different from IP for making hypothermia decisions in suspected HIE. This could enhance remote Sarnat evaluations and initiate earlier therapeutic interventions.",

The aim was to determine the effect of SDF/KI pretreatment on the bonding of SDR Plus Bulk-Fill Flowable (Dentsply) with Clearfil SE Bond 2 (Kuraray) and G-Premio Bond (GC) in self-etch mode on sound dentin. A total of 240 dentin samples were prepared and assigned to 12 groups based on SDF/KI pretreatment (with or without), adhesive type, and testing time (1, 3, and 6 months). The shear bond strength (SBS) was measured using an UltraTester. SBS data were analyzed using three-way factorial model (Adhesive × Pretreatment × Time) and Wald (F) tests, with α = 0.05. Fracture modes were analyzed using χ2 and Fisher’s exact test, with α = 0.05. Clearfil performed significantly better than G-Premio at all time points (p &lt; 0.001). Riva Star pretreatment significantly reduced SBS for both adhesives at all time points (p &lt; 0.001). SBS reduction was significantly higher for Clearfil (p &lt; 0.001). The effect of storage was not significant (p = 0.388). Fracture mode distribution differed significantly between adhesives (p &lt; 0.001). Pretreatment × fracture interaction was significant for Clearfil (p = 0.0052). Mixed fractures in G-premio were rare.",

    "Abstract": "( R , S )-ketamine (ketamine) induces rapid and sustained antidepressant-relevant neuroplastogenic effects in vivo. The metabolite ( 2R , 6R )-hydroxynorketamine (2R6R) forms shortly after the administration of ketamine, and independently elicits rapid plasticity and sustained metaplasticity. Ketamine’s therapeutic actions appear to result from distinct, time-sensitive plasticity phases, though the mechanisms that mediate these phases, and whether these synaptic actions are unique to ketamine or 2R6R, remain poorly understood. Here, we distinguished the synaptic actions of ketamine from its metabolites at the hippocampal Schaffer collateral-CA1 (SC-CA1) synapse. By modifying ketamine’s chemical structure to hinder its metabolism to 2R6R, or exposing slices to ketamine or 2R6R in vitro , we find that 2R6R, but not ketamine itself, induces rapid and sustained metaplasticity in both male and female mice. 2R6R’s acute plasticity and sustained metaplasticity required mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent signaling, and both phases of 2R6R’s synaptic effects were mimicked by pharmacological mTOR activation. Rapid, mTOR-dependent potentiation evoked by 2R6R was followed by long-lasting antidepressant-relevant behavior and metaplasticity that required activation of the inositol trisphosphate receptor. L-type Ca 2+ channel signaling was required for only sustained synaptic actions, consistent with 2R6R’s metaplasticity being activity-dependent. Pharmacological or antibody TrkB blockade after, but not before, 2R6R treatment prevented metaplastic synaptic priming, indicating a delayed contribution of BDNF/TrkB signaling. Blocking protein synthesis did not prevent 2R6R-induced metaplasticity. Our results implicate a sequence of plasticity mechanisms underlying 2R6R’s synaptic actions in the hippocampus. These findings are relevant for the delineation of activity-dependent and time-sensitive synaptic mechanisms relevant to the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. Significance statement ( R,S )-ketamine’s therapeutic actions follow distinct, time-sensitive plasticity phases, yet the synaptic mechanisms that mediate these states are unclear. We delineate time-dependent processes distinguishing the hippocampal synaptic actions of ( R,S )-ketamine from its metabolite ( 2R,6R )-hydroxynorketamine (2R6R). We find that 2R6R, but not ( R,S )-ketamine alone, evokes a rapid plasticity and sustained metaplasticity in the mouse hippocampus. Mammalian target of rapamycin activity was necessary and sufficient for the rapid and sustained actions of 2R6R. IP 3 R, BDNF/TrkB, and L-type Ca 2+ channel signaling were necessary for 2R6R’s metaplasticity. These results implicate distinct synaptic mechanisms relevant for the development of novel rapid-acting antidepressants, as well as delineating synaptic mechanisms engaged by activity-dependent behavior and disorders of impaired plasticity.",

    "Abstract": "This article examines the concepts of war and peace through the lens of Christian philosophy, integrating anthropological, ethical, and socio-political perspectives. It argues that while conflict is rooted in human biology and social organization, war is not a biological necessity but a culturally constructed phenomenon shaped by ideology, power structures, and moral judgment. Drawing on insights from ethology, political theory, and Christian moral theology, the study analyzes the causes of war in modern mass societies, including nationalism, global capitalism, media influence, and environmental degradation. Central attention is given to the Christian tradition’s balanced approach to war and peace, particularly its articulation of just war theory as a middle path between pacifism and militarism. The article contends that war is inherently irrational, though occasionally morally permissible as a penultimate resort aimed at restoring just peace. Ultimately, it presents Christian ethical messianism as a coherent normative framework for evaluating armed conflict, assigning responsibility, and fostering a durable peace grounded in human dignity, justice, and the moral order.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Older adult falls during step negotiation result in higher injury rates compared to level ground falls. Previous research on discrete events during step negotiations may not capture important age-related changes. Curve analysis techniques enable assessment of an entire time series and may further advance the understanding of older adult falls during step negotiation. The purpose of the current study was to investigate lower extremity kinematics during transition step negotiation in older women with fall history compared to young women using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Methods: 15 older female adults with a fall history and 15 young female adults participated in the study. Participants performed walking trials along a 5.5 m raised walkway, descended a 17 cm step and continued walking 3 m. Data was processed from lead limb toe-off prior to the step, through lead limb weight acceptance of the transition step. SPM was used to perform independent t-test analysis of the three-dimensional lower extremity time series. Results: The older faller group showed significantly decreased lead hip abduction (9–19% of step negotiation, mean difference: 3.74°, p = 0.045), increased lead knee flexion (65–80% of step negotiation, mean difference: 5.8°, p = 0.012), and increased trail limb hip adduction (91–100% of step negotiation, mean difference: 3.92°, p = 0.046). Conclusions: The older faller group showed altered hip joint angles in the frontal plane and knee joint angles in the sagittal plane during early swing and late weight acceptance phases, which may reflect compensatory strategies for reduced strength and/or balance. Curve analysis provides additional insight into age-related kinematic changes during step negotiation that may be related to older adult fall risk.",

    "Abstract": "Background: Caloric restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention based on limiting calories relative to the basic energy needs of the organism, which changes the intensity of metabolism, causes changes in the functioning of the endocrine and sympathetic systems, and influences the expression of genes in muscle, heart, and brain cells. During the use of CR, there is a transition from carbohydrate supply to increased fat metabolism. Fatty acids are more or less susceptible to free radicals, depending on their molecular structure. Oxidation (peroxidation) contributes to the production of metabolites (including hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid), some of which are involved in inflammation. Methods: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of long-term caloric restriction on the tissue levels of selected fatty acids and fatty acid-derived lipid mediators with pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory properties in skeletal muscle and intestinal tissues. The study was carried out on C57BL/6 mice. During the 8-month experiment, the mice in the study group were fed a 30% calorie restricted diet—according to the Every-Other-Day Diet concept. Analyses were performed on intestinal and muscle tissues collected from animals. Fatty acid derivatives were isolated using solid-phase extraction (C-18 columns) columns, and isolation of fatty acids was performed using a modified Folch method. The compounds were analyzed by liquid and gas chromatography. Results: CR induced detectable alterations in both fatty acid profiles and lipid mediator concentrations in a tissue-specific manner. However, most of these changes did not remain statistically significant after multiple testing correction. Conclusions: These findings suggest potential effects of long-term CR on lipid signaling pathways, although the current dataset lacks the statistical power required to draw definitive conclusions. This study highlights the need for further research using larger sample sizes and integrated multiomic approaches to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying lipidomic adaptations to prolonged caloric restriction.",

    "Abstract": "Water scarcity is one of the most critical constraints in arid and semi-arid regions, directly limiting plant growth, yield, and quality through its effects on physiological and biochemical processes. In Iran, where most areas experience arid or semi-arid conditions, enhancing crop resilience to drought is a pressing need. Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia L.), a medicinal and nutritionally valuable cucurbit, is particularly sensitive to water deficits. This study evaluated the effects of foliar-applied potassium (K), zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), and silicon (Si) on vegetative growth, physiological responses, and nutrient accumulation under drought stress. The experiment followed a factorial design with two factors: foliar treatments (Zn, K, Ca, Si) and drought stress levels (50%, 75%, and 100% field capacity, FC) with five repetitions. Drought stress increased ion leakage and reduced relative water content (RWC), especially at 50% FC, while Ca and Si effectively alleviated these effects. Si-treated plants showed the highest RWC at 100% FC, whereas Ca was most effective at 75% FC. Chlorophyll and carotenoid levels declined under drought; however, Si and Zn preserved chlorophylls, and Ca and Si enhanced carotenoids. Photosystem II performance was maintained by K and Ca, with Si showing particular benefits at 50% FC. Biochemical adjustments included greater carbohydrate and proline accumulation, stimulated mainly by K and Si, while Ca and Si enhanced phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Ca was most effective in sustaining ascorbic acid and peroxidase activity, while Si and K improved catalase activity. Growth and yield traits declined significantly under drought but were best preserved by Ca, followed by K and Si, with Zn showing limited benefits. Nutrient uptake (Ca, Mg, K) in roots and shoots improved under Ca and K treatments, with Si contributing under severe stress. Overall, Ca emerged as the most versatile element, Si excelled under severe drought, and K supported osmotic and photosynthetic functions.",

    "Abstract": "Drawing on a systematic review of both international and Chinese-language scholarship on counter-urbanization in China, this article proposes a comprehensive typology of counter-urbanization migrations—consisting of eight types of new migrants—based on the diverse motivations driving such migration. We build a bilingual corpus of 273 research papers published between the 1970s and 2025. Integrating bibliometric mapping and qualitative synthesis, we conduct a systematic review to trace the temporal evolution and thematic diversification of counter-urbanization research. The review reveals persistent conceptual ambiguity surrounding counter-urbanization in the Chinese context, which this study addresses by conceptually distinguishing counter-urbanization from suburban expansion, population decentralization, and return migration. Empirically, counter-urbanization in China is shown to involve heterogeneous demographic groups and multiple drivers. Our synthesis identifies a fundamental analytical divide between consumption-oriented and production-oriented engagements with rural space. Counter-urbanization in China therefore cannot be understood as a singular demographic reversal. Finally, contrary to the common view, it reveals that state intervention in China functions primarily as an enabling infrastructure rather than a direct driver of migration. Overall, this review advances a more nuanced theoretical framework for understanding urban-to-rural mobility in China and contributes to broader comparative debates on counter-urbanization beyond Western contexts.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Natural Fiber‐Reinforced Composites (NFRCs) have emerged as potential alternatives to synthetic fiber‐based composites for engineering applications in the automotive and aerospace industries. Despite their advantages, such as biodegradability and availability, NFRCs face limitations that restrict their use to non‐structural applications due to challenges such as low‐impact resistance. Hybrid composites have been employed to address these challenges. This study investigates the low‐velocity impact (LVI) response of abaca/rubber hybrid composites with varying stacking sequences: abaca/rubber/abaca [A/R/A], abaca/rubber/rubber/abaca [A/R/R/A], and abaca/rubber/abaca/rubber/abaca [A/R/A/R/A]. The composites were subjected to impact energy levels of 10.24, 17.14, and 23.95 J using a conical‐shaped impactor. Impact energy absorption, peak force, energy loss percentage (ELP), coefficient of restitution (CoR), and damage analysis were among the important performance metrics that were assessed. The [A/R/A] configuration demonstrated superior energy absorption, achieving 14.06% and 25.83% higher absorption compared to [A/R/R/A] and [A/R/A/R/A], respectively. The energy absorption ratios for [A/R/A], [A/R/R/A], and [A/R/A/R/A] were 70.06%, 60.20%, and 53.56%, respectively. Conversely, the [A/R/A/R/A] sequence exhibited enhanced damage resistance at all energy levels. These results indicate how hybrid composites may combine energy absorption and damage resistance to overcome the drawbacks of pure NFRCs, making them appropriate for sacrificial layer applications in low‐velocity impact conditions.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Visual snow syndrome (VSS) is a chronic neurological disorder associated with impaired mental health. While self-efficacy and quality of life (QOL) are known to influence mental health outcomes (depression and suicidal ideation) in clinical populations, their roles in VSS remain unexplored. This study aimed to examine the associations among VSS, self-efficacy, QOL, mental health outcomes and the potential serial mediation roles of self-efficacy and QOL. A cross-sectional study compared 64 VSS patients and 67 healthy controls matched with age, sex and education level. Participants completed validated questionnaires assessing self-efficacy (GSES), QOL (WHOQOL-BREF), depression (CES-D), and suicidal ideation (BSSI, first five items). Analyses included group comparisons, correlation analyses to examine variable relationships, multimodel linear regression and serial mediation modeling to test the hypothesized sequential pathway from VSS through self-efficacy and quality of life to mental health outcomes. Compared with controls, VSS patients demonstrated significantly lower self-efficacy (VSS: 23.6 ± 6.2; Controls: 30.6 ± 6.0; p &lt; 0.001) and QOL (VSS: 62.5 ± 9.5; Controls: 73.6 ± 8.8; p &lt; 0.001), alongside elevated depression (median [IQR]: VSS: 28 [21,34]; Controls: 11 [7, 15]; p &lt; 0.001) and suicidal ideation (VSS: 6 [5, 7]; Controls: 5 [5,6]; p &lt; 0.01). Serial mediation analysis revealed that the effects of VSS on depression and suicidal ideation were mediated through self-efficacy and QOL sequentially. The total indirect effect for depression was 7.73 (95% CI [5.64–9.85]), with QOL accounting for 49.09% of the total effect. For suicidal ideation, the total indirect effect was 0.80 (95% CI [0.39–1.22]). Lower self-efficacy and QOL appear to serially mediate the associations between VSS and mental health impairments. These preliminary, cross-sectional findings indicate that self-efficacy and QOL may serve as modifiable intervention targets that mediate or moderate the risk of depression and suicidal ideation in individuals with VSS. Clinicians should prioritize routine assessments of these factors to guide early intervention strategies, although longitudinal studies are needed to confirm these causal pathways.",

    "Abstract": "Introduction Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt intervention to prevent cardiac complications. While insulin and glucose administration remains a cornerstone of treatment, inhaled β2-adrenergic agonists have been proposed as a complementary or alternative strategy, particularly in emergency settings. This scoping review aimed to describe the utility of inhaled β2-agonists in lowering serum potassium levels in adult patients. Methods A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines and the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. Experimental studies published within the past ten years evaluating the use of inhaled β2-agonists in adult patients with hyperkalemia were included. Five studies were analyzed (three randomized controlled trials and three quasi-experimental studies), assessing dosage, route of administration, magnitude of potassium reduction, and reported adverse events. Results Most studies used nebulized salbutamol at a dose of 10 mg, with observed reductions in serum potassium ranging from 0.62 to 1.636 mEq/L, and a peak effect between 1 and 4 hours post-administration. One study also reported the use of levalbuterol. The most common adverse effects were tachycardia, dizziness, and mild hyperglycemia, all of which were clinically manageable. Efficacy was demonstrated in both patients with chronic kidney disease and in individuals with normal renal function. Conclusion Inhaled β2-agonists, particularly nebulized salbutamol, represent an effective and safe therapeutic option for the acute reduction of serum potassium in adults with hyperkalemia. Their rapid onset of action and applicability across various patient profiles make them a valuable tool in emergency settings, especially where immediate access to advanced therapies such as dialysis is limited. Further research is warranted to evaluate long-term outcomes, safety in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities, and optimal dosing strategies.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Phase-retrieval from coded diffraction patterns (CDP) is important to X-ray crystallography, diffraction tomography and astronomical imaging, yet remains a hard, non-convex inverse problem. We show that CDP recovery can be reformulated exactly as the minimization of a continuous-variable XY Hamiltonian and solved by gain-based photonic networks. The coupled-mode equations we exploit are the natural mean-field dynamics of exciton-polariton condensate lattices, coupled-laser arrays and driven photon Bose-Einstein condensates, while other hardware such as the spatial photonic Ising machine can implement the same update rule through high-speed digital feedback, preserving full optical parallelism. Numerical experiments on images, two- and three-dimensional vortices and unstructured complex data demonstrate that the gain-based solver consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Relaxed-Reflect-Reflect (RRR) algorithm in the medium-noise regime (signal-to-noise ratios 10-40 dB) and retains this advantage as problem size scales. Because the physical platform performs the continuous optimisation, our approach promises fast, energy-efficient phase retrieval on readily available photonic hardware.",

This study evaluates bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor known for its anti‐proliferative and anti‐inflammatory properties, using in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro experiments with ARPE‐19 cells revealed that bortezomib significantly reduced migration, proliferation, and contraction, key processes in PVR pathogenesis. In a mouse model of PVR, bortezomib treatment mitigated clinical and histological presentations, showing a protective effect. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that bortezomib inhibited the nuclear factor kappa‐light‐chain‐enhancer of activated B cells (NF‐κB) pathway by reducing its activation and preserving its inhibitor, IκB. Additionally, bortezomib modulated inflammatory responses by suppressing pro‐inflammatory mediators such as MCP‐1, IP‐10, IL‐4, IL‐13, and IL‐17 while enhancing anti‐inflammatory cytokines like IL‐10. These findings highlight the potential of bortezomib as a promising therapeutic option for managing PVR.",

    "Abstract": "Background/Objectives: Challenging behaviour post-stroke can complicate care and disrupt rehabilitation, yet its presentation and management are underreported. This study explored how such behaviours were documented in clinical records and managed in stroke settings, and how care delivery and discharge outcomes were documented in this context. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted across two NHS stroke units, covering all admissions between March and April 2022. Patient records were reviewed to capture demographic, clinical, and behavioural information, together with details relating to management and discharge. Challenging behaviour was identified retrospectively from clinical documentation during routine care. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the data. Results: Forty-eight stroke admissions were examined, with challenging behaviour documented in thirteen patients (27%). Eleven had ischaemic stroke, with moderate severity common (n = 6), while inattention/neglect (n = 5) and infection (n = 4) were also documented. Behaviours were commonly recorded as confusion or agitation, and predominantly by nursing staff. Challenges to care delivery were documented in six of these patients, and additional professional input was provided for seven. Discharge delays were documented in patients with challenging behaviour, and the median length of stay was notably longer for this group (19 days compared with 7). Documentation of cognitive or delirium screening was uncommon. Conclusions: Challenging behaviour was documented in over a quarter of acute stroke admissions and was documented alongside greater care complexity and longer hospital stays. These preliminary descriptive findings from a small sample indicate a need for further exploration to better characterise challenging behaviour following stroke and its implications for care.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT A significant gap persists between advanced catalyst synthesis in laboratories and the industrial requirements for water electrolysis. The key challenge lies in simultaneously achieving electrode scalability, high catalytic activity, and long‐term stability. Through theoretical simulation screening, we synthesized a free‐standing cathode catalyst composed of Ru clusters anchored on a Ni x Fe y OOH substrate via Ru─O─Ni/Fe bridges. Advanced characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Ru–NiFe catalyst achieves efficient catalytic activity due to Ru─O─Ni/Fe bridges, fine‐tuning the electronic structure and enhancing catalytic energetics, while Ru cluster introduction increases the number of active sites and modulates hydrogen intermediate adsorption/desorption strength. The as‐prepared Ru–NiFe electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction delivers ultralow overpotentials of 5 mV at 10 mA cm − 2 and maintains stable operation at 500 mA cm − 2 for over 1000 h. A large‐scale (19 × 19 cm 2 ) anion‐exchange‐membrane water electrolyzer (AEM–WE) based on Ru–NiFe shows a low cell voltage of 2.98 V at 10 A and stable operation for 2800 h.

    "Abstract": "Some donor-conceived persons are born with an autosomal recessive genetic condition. In response, some fertility clinics categorically restrict the further use of the gametes from the donor who transmitted the pathogenic variant, although the chance of recurrence is usually very low. The level of specific risk that a recipient or physician is willing to accept depends on various factors, including severity, lived experiences and personal preferences. However, on a policy level, we argue for consistency and guidance on the principled question of whether the (further) use of gametes from donors who are carriers of a known pathogenic variant with autosomal recessive inheritance is acceptable. Provided that the identified risk is comparable to the general risk of genetic conditions, the continued use of the donor gametes can remain an acceptable option.",

This single-arm, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the ASC-depleting anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody daratumumab in patients with SLE (NCT04810754). The primary endpoint is the reduction in serum anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels at week 12. Key secondary end points include safety, clinical efficacy, and immunologic changes. Ten female patients with active disease and inadequate responses to at least two immunosuppressive drugs have received eight subcutaneous injections of 1800 mg daratumumab weekly, with dexamethasone as premedication (20 mg for first two injections, then 10 mg). By week 12, anti-dsDNA antibody levels have been reduced by a median of 109.6 IU/ml (95% CI 38.1 – 274.5). The treatment resulted in rapid and sustained clinical improvements across all patients and organ domains, reflected by a 100% SRI-4 (Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index-4) response rate at week 12. Hypogammaglobulinemia occurred in 5/10 patients, requiring immunoglobulin substitution. Daratumumab treatment has depleted circulating ASCs, reduced type I interferon activity, and profoundly modulated the T-cell responses. These findings highlight the pivotal role of ASCs in SLE pathogenesis and support daratumumab as therapeutic option for SLE.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This study examines how retraction reasons, retraction initiators, journal visibility, access models and Twitter activity associate with the speed of retracting flawed scientific publications. Design/methodology/approach Using a Cox proportional hazards model, we analyzed 1,179 articles retracted in 2019–2021, including a subset of 98 papers tweeted before retraction. Findings The results reveal that higher journal impact factor and open-access status were associated with faster retractions. However, a significant negative interaction indicated that the effect of high-impact journals diminished for open-access publications. Journal-initiated retractions were slower overall, except in cases of misconduct such as co-authorship deception and plagiarism, where journals acted more quickly. Among retraction reasons, only deception in co-authoring was associated with significantly slower retractions, but this trend reversed when journals led the process. The association of social media attention with retraction speed was statistically robust, albeit modest in magnitude: each additional pre-retraction tweet was associated with a slight reduction in time to retraction. Bootstrap validation confirmed the stability of this finding. Originality/value Public scrutiny, institutional responsibility and publication visibility jointly shape the time to retraction. This study advances altmetrics discourse by positioning social media as a conditional, yet meaningful, participant in the retraction lifecycle. Beyond altmetrics, our findings highlight retractions as part of a broader network of relationships between public accountability, digital ethics and science communication, positioning them as moments of accountability shaped jointly by journals, ethical responsibilities and digital publics.",

    "Abstract": "This research focuses on the challenge of measuring the socio-economic impact of road traffic accidents (RTAs) by examining how losses are redistributed across major institutional sectors, including the government, businesses, and households. Unlike traditional cost-based approaches, the analysis relies on a modified input–output framework that captures not only the direct losses but also the indirect damage flows transmitted from one sector to another. This methodology makes it possible to reveal the multiplicative propagation of losses, determine the proportion of net costs, and quantify the transfer dependencies between institutional agents. Using compiled and adapted data for the Azerbaijani economy, the study estimates the net economic damage from RTAs at 2268.17 million manats after adjusting for internal transfers. The results show that households bear more than 47% of total losses, the enterprise sector accounts for approximately 39%, and the government absorbs nearly 13%. The model also isolates an “additional damage” component, reflecting lost income, profits, and tax revenues, and demonstrates that every 1000 RTA generates a chain reaction of interlinked costs that substantially amplifies the overall effect. The findings highlight the necessity of integrating input–output analytical approaches into the practical assessment of RTA-related economic consequences, particularly in countries with limited statistical capacity and structurally diverse institutional linkages.",

The goals of this study were to investigate the effect of aging on measures historically used to assess retrocochlear function—speech recognition performance-intensity functions in noise, and high-level auditory brainstem responses (ABR) at two presentation rates, and to examine their association. Design: Nineteen younger (18 to 36 yrs) and 19 older adults (65 to 81 yrs) with normal audiometric pure-tone averages and clinically present distortion product otoacoustic emissions took part in this study. All test materials were presented to the right ear through insert earphones. Performance-intensity functions were obtained using Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6 words in multitalker babble, at 6 signal to noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from −5 to +20 dB SNR (noise fixed at 50 dB HL). ABRs were recorded in response to 80 dB nHL clicks presented at a slower rate (11.3/sec) and a faster rate (41.3/sec). Results: The performance-intensity function slopes were comparable between the younger and older age groups, but older adults needed more favorable SNRs to achieve the same level of performance as their younger counterparts. The electrophysiological finding of lower I/V ABR amplitude ratios in older adults is consistent with an interpretation of cochlear synaptopathy. However, there was no association between the speech recognition performance-intensity function metrics and ABR I/V amplitude ratios, even though full performance-intensity functions were obtained, using low-context monosyllabic words that depend more heavily on peripheral processing. Conclusions: Results of this study show that aging negatively impacted speech recognition in noise and ABR responses. Although the age-related reduction in ABR wave I/V ratios could be interpreted as evidence of cochlear synaptopathy, age did not differentially impact speech recognition in noise as a function of SNR. In addition, there was no association between the electrophysiological and performance-intensity function metrics. These results add to a growing list of perceptual measures that did not follow the pattern of results predicted by age-related cochlear synaptopathy, despite the expected reduction in ABR wave I/V ratios.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Background Broad-spectrum combination products with efficacy against endo- and ectoparasites offer the potential to optimize owner adherence to expert recommendations for canine antiparasitic treatments. In the development program for a chewable tablet containing fluralaner, moxidectin, and pyrantel, a non-terminal study design was implemented to determine anthelminthic efficacy. Four laboratory studies assessed the efficacy of this investigational veterinary product (IVP) against adult hookworms and adult Toxascaris leonina . Methods In four single-site, non-terminal dose confirmation studies, dogs were inoculated with third-stage larvae of Uncinaria stenocephala (Studies 1 and 2), Ancylostoma caninum (Study 3), or larvated eggs of T. leonina (Study 4). Using fecal egg counts (FECs) from those infections, dogs were ranked and randomized to groups (Studies 1, 3, and 4, 10 per group; Study 2, 8 per group and treated once orally, on day 0, with the minimum recommended IVP dose (fluralaner 10 mg/kg, moxidectin 0.025 mg/kg, pyrantel 5 mg/kg) ( BRAVECTO ® TriUNO, MSD), or left untreated. Approximately 2 weeks later, both groups in all studies were treated orally with a diagnostic dewormer (DDW) containing emodepside-praziquantel (Profender ® modified-release Tablets for Dogs, Vetoquinol). The primary efficacy objective was determined by counts of expelled worms recovered after DDW treatment. Copro-antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and FECs were completed at key time points. Results Adequacy of infection was shown in all studies. Relative to the control groups, statistically significant reductions in mean worm counts were found in IVP-treated groups in Studies 1, 2, 3, and 4 (99.8%, P &lt; 0.0001; 100%, P = 0.0002; 100%, P &lt; 0.0001; and 99.4%, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively). All control dogs had positive FECs until the DDW treatment, while no eggs were detected after day 0 in 36 of the 38 IVP-treated dogs. Findings from copro-PCR and antigen-ELISA were consistent with and confirmatory of the conclusions from worm counts and FECs. Conclusions A single, orally administered dose of this chewable tablet formulation is effective in treating canine infections with adult hookworms ( U. stenocephala , A. caninum ) and T. leonina . Non-terminal studies present a valid means of determining the efficacy of anthelmintic treatments for these canine intestinal parasites. Graphical Abstract",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Bullying in school is a multidetermined phenomenon that becomes even more complex with the increasing relevance of social status at the onset of middle adolescence. This age - between 13 and 17 - is characterized by substantial social, emotional, and cognitive developments, implicating two negative social emotions in bullying behavior: envy and schadenfreude. Envy can be distinguished between benign envy, which involves improvement motivation, and malicious envy that leads to hostile feelings towards the envied person. Schadenfreude is defined as joy over the downfall of a rival. We propose that malicious envy is positively and benign envy negatively linked to bullying perpetration and that both effects are mediated by schadenfreude. In a preregistered study with a sample of n = 2,172 secondary school students, we collected data across two waves to test this proposed mediation model. Neither malicious nor benign envy is directly related to bullying; however, the effect of malicious envy on bullying perpetration is fully mediated by schadenfreude. Exploratory analyses suggest that these pathways differ by gender, indicating that in girls, malicious envy only affects bullying through schadenfreude, whereas in boys, bullying is likely influenced through other processes.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract High nitrogen (N) input is typical of irrigated intensively managed dairy pasture systems, but the plant uptake of the applied N is often low. This leads to high nitrate (NO 3 − ) accumulation in the soil which, under wet conditions, can trigger significant loss of N as nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and dinitrogen (N 2 ). We investigated the effect of soil moisture [60, 80 and 100% water filled pore space (WFPS)] and NO 3 − concentrations (45 mg and 80 mg NO 3 − -N kg − 1 soil) on emissions of N 2 O and N 2 by applying 15 NO 3 − -N as a tracer in laboratory conditions using soil from an intensive dairy pasture. The flux of N 2 dominated N loss at 80% and 100% WFPS and N 2 O emissions were more strongly affected by NO 3 − concentrations compared to N 2 emissions. N 2 O emissions responded more strongly to NO 3 − concentrations at 100% WFPS than at 80% WFPS. The flux of N 2 O was significantly lower at 60% WFPS compared to the other WFPS levels, with no detectable N 2 emission. Denitrification dominated N 2 O emissions at 100% WFPS, whereas at 80% WFPS, contributions from denitrification and other sources were similar. These results demonstrate that while managing soil moisture and NO 3 − availability can reduce N 2 O emissions in intensive dairy pastures, substantial fertiliser N losses as N 2 are likely to persist, limiting improvements in overall N use efficiency.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Background This study aimed to determine the potential interference of calcium dobesilate in two urinary total protein detection methods. Methods Urine samples from patients receiving calcium dobesilate were collected, and drug concentrations were quantified using liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry. Paired‐difference testing was used to assess if calcium dobesilate interfered with the total protein concentration measurement. The interference effect of calcium dobesilate on the detection method was evaluated using dose–effect experiments. Results In total, 22 24‐h urine samples and 50 spot urine samples were collected. The calcium dobesilate concentrations ranged from 76 to 738 mg/L (median: 243 [161, 328] mg/L) and 60–2236 mg/L (median: 370 [195, 667] mg/L) in the 24‐h and spot urine samples, respectively. Paired‐difference testing showed that the total protein results deviated by 0.8%–12.1% and 13.0%–286.4% with the pyrogallol red‐molybdate and benzethonium chloride methods, respectively, when the calcium dobesilate concentration was 4500 mg/L. The dose–response experiment with the benzethonium chloride method demonstrated a “J‐shaped” effect; negative interference on the total protein concentration occurred at low and medium calcium dobesilate concentrations, but positive interference occurred at high calcium dobesilate concentrations. Conclusions Calcium dobesilate did not significantly interfere with the pyrogallol red‐molybdate method but did significantly interfere with the benzethonium chloride method. The direction and degree of interference were related to the urinary protein and drug concentrations. Discontinuing calcium dobesilate for 1–2 days before obtaining a urine sample for total protein detection is recommended.",

    "Abstract": "Infrasound, physically defined as sound at frequencies below 20 Hertz, can travel long distances with minimal attenuation and permeate biological tissues due to its marked particle displacement and deep penetration. Generated by both natural phenomena and human-made systems, infrasound has drawn increasing scientific and public attention regarding its potential physiological and psychological effects. Experimental studies demonstrate that infrasound can modulate mechanosensitive structures at the cellular level, particularly pressure-sensitive ion channels such as PIEZO1 and TRPV4, leading to intracellular calcium influx, oxidative stress, altered intercellular communication, and in some settings, apoptosis. These responses vary according to sound pressure levels, frequencies, exposure duration, and tissue type. In the cardiovascular system, higher sound pressures have been associated with mitochondrial injury and fibrosis, whereas low sound pressures may exert context-dependent protective effects. In animal models, prolonged or intense exposure to infrasound has been shown to induce neuroinflammatory responses and memory impairment. Short-term studies in humans at moderate intensities have reported minimal physiological changes, with psychological and contextual factors influencing symptom perception. Occupational environments such as factories and agricultural settings may contain elevated levels of infrasound, underscoring the importance of systematic measurements and exposure assessments. At the same time, controlled infrasound stimulation has shown potential as an adjunct modality in bone repair and tissue regeneration, highlighting its dual capacity as both a biological stressor and a possible therapeutic tool. Overall, existing data indicate that infrasound may be harmful at chronic exposure depending on intensity and frequency, yet beneficial when precisely regulated. Future research should standardize exposure metrics, refine measurement technologies, and clarify dose–response relationships to better define the health risks and therapeutic applications of infrasound.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT We investigate the transition between stability and chaos in the damped Klein‐Gordon equation, a fundamental model for wave propagation and energy dissipation. Using semigroup methods and spectral criteria, we derive explicit thresholds that determine when the system exhibits asymptotic stability and when it displays strong chaotic dynamics, including Devaney and distributional chaos as well as topological mixing. The results yield a classification of the dynamical regimes in terms of damping, stiffness, and propagation parameters, showing that the system admits only two long‐term behaviours: Convergence to equilibrium or chaos. This dichotomy not only unifies and extends previous partial results but also highlights the mechanisms by which linear partial differential equations can generate complex dynamics typically associated with nonlinear systems. Potential applications arise in acoustics, wave mechanics, and signal transmission, where predicting the onset of chaos versus stability is of practical importance.",

We use data on the total recommended rejections and acceptances for all referees who reviewed at least one paper for the Journal of Financial Economics (JFE) between 1994 and 2020. We show that reviewers who write more reports are more likely to recommend the acceptance of manuscripts. We also find that older reviewers, those who graduated from or are affiliated with prestigious universities, and those with more and highly cited publications are more likely to recommend acceptance. There is also some evidence that reviewers with doctoral training in economics, mathematics, physics, and engineering are more likely to recommend acceptance than those with a PhD in finance. We find no consistent evidence of significant differences between genders or among reviewer demographic characteristics. We also document that reviewers who themselves publish more successfully in JFE and publish highly cited articles are, ceteris paribus , more likely to recommend rejection of reviewed manuscripts.

Using the Italian Circular Economy Stakeholder Platform (ICESP) as case study, it explores the mechanisms through which digital infrastructures orchestrate knowledge flows, facilitate structured learning, influence policy, and strengthen network governance. Findings reveal that ICESP's combination of technical tools and inclusive governance enables diverse actors—public institutions, businesses, academia, civil society—to co‐create and disseminate best practices, overcome systemic barriers, and align regulatory frameworks with practical needs. The study extends social capital theory by showing how digital platforms simultaneously build structural, relational, and cognitive capital to sustain circular innovation ecosystems. It also contributes to platform ecosystem research by illustrating how digital infrastructures act as socio‐technical systems that integrate bottom‐up collaboration with top‐down coordination. Managerially, the paper provides guidance for designing participatory, trust‐based platforms that enhance collaboration, learning, and policy coherence in circular transitions.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Treatment of oily wastewater generated from industrial and human activities (particularly oil recovery processes) remains a long‐standing global challenge. Oily residues (e.g., emulsified oil and fine solids) in the wastewater readily foul and block water‐treatment equipment and downstream units, thereby reducing treatment efficiency and increasing operational and maintenance costs. Here, we report a molecularly engineered triblock polymer (denoted as PHZ) that markedly suppresses oil fouling under different conditions. PHZ comprises cationic, hydrophobic, and zwitterionic blocks, which enable its rapid adsorption onto diverse substrates and foulants, followed by reorganization into a hydration‐rich interfacial layer. Upon adsorption, PHZ molecules reduce the interfacial water contact angle from ≈110° to ≈20° and generate strong steric repulsion between foulants and substrates, providing both energy and physical barriers to mitigate fouling. The resulting PHZ layer prevents direct contact between foulants and target substrates, achieving ≈49% reduction in oil fouling even at an ultralow dosage (e.g., 20 ppm) and outperforming leading commercial antifouling reagents. The combined rapid adsorption, robust interfacial hydration, strong suppression of hydrophobic attractions, and generation of steric repulsions establish a mechanistic basis for PHZ as an efficient fouling‐resistant additive and provide design principles for next‐generation chemicals and materials for diverse industrial water treatment processes.",

    "Abstract": "ABSTRACT Functional elastic cartilage remains an unmet challenge in regenerative medicine, limiting reconstructive options for children born with microtia, the congenital malformation of the auricle. The current gold standard treatment relies on harvesting rib cartilage, an invasive procedure associated with donor site morbidity, impaired aesthetics, and unnaturally stiff ears due to the use of hyaline cartilage. Here, we engineered primary human auricular chondrocytes to generate functional elastic cartilage with near‐native tissue properties. This was achieved through the synergistic integration of growth factor‐controlled chondrogenesis, stress‐relaxing biomaterials that promote elastic cartilage formation, and a bioreactor platform enabling homogeneous tissue maturation. The engineered grafts exhibited a uniform extracellular matrix composition with elastin, glycosaminoglycans, and collagen II comparable to native auricular cartilage, while lacking the fibrocartilage marker collagen I. The resulting tissue achieved a compressive modulus of 1.1 ± 0.03 MPa, matching native cartilage (1.0 ± 0.1 MPa), and maintained its structural integrity and elasticity in vivo for 6 weeks in a subcutaneous rat model. These grafts represent the closest replication of native human elastic cartilage achieved ex vivo to date, establishing a foundation for clinically viable, functional auricular grafts.",

    "Abstract": "Purpose This article introduces Middle-Out Design (MOD), a collaborative framework that integrates human and non-human perspectives in urban sustainability planning. It addresses limitations in existing participatory design and planning approaches that privilege institutional or human-centred agendas. Design/methodology/approach The MOD framework structures collaboration across top-down, bottom-up and mediating actors through four iterative stages: Coalition, Design, Development and Deployment. Its exploratory application is illustrated through four formative vignettes focused on community gardening, flood resilience, wombat rehabilitation and adaptive robotic environments. Findings Through these vignettes, the article contributes illustrative insights into how MOD fosters more inclusive and adaptive planning by enabling coalitions to form that work across diverse priorities, knowledge systems and spatial scales. The studies these vignettes are based on highlight the role of intermediaries, the value of connecting with institutional processes and the need for adaptive governance that includes ecological and non-human considerations. Practical implications MOD provides an adaptable pathway for practitioners, researchers and policymakers to engage with complex urban systems. It fosters decision-making responsive to changing social, environmental and institutional conditions and supports coalitions capable of sustaining long-term, cross-scale collaboration. Originality/value MOD advances participatory design and planning by extending its remit beyond human actors and early-stage engagement. It contributes a novel approach that embeds collaboration and learning throughout implementation and post-deployment, and in so doing, it integrates more-than-human considerations in urban planning.",

    "Abstract": "Abstract Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) against HIV-1 can suppress viremia in vivo and inform vaccine development. Here we characterized 007, a V3 glycan site bNAb exhibiting high levels of antiviral activity against multiclade pseudovirus panels. 007 targets an N332 gp120 glycan-independent V3 epitope, a site of the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env) vulnerability to which only weakly neutralizing antibodies had previously been identified. Functional analyses demonstrated distinct binding and neutralization profiles compared to classical V3 glycan site bNAbs. A 007 Fab-Env cryogenic electron microscopy structure revealed contacts with the V3 324 GD/NIR 327 motif and interactions with N156 gp120 and N301 gp120 glycans. In contrast to classical V3 bNAbs, 007 binding to Env does not depend on the N332 gp120 glycan, rendering it resistant to common escape mutations. Structures of 007 IgG-Env trimer complexes showed two Env trimers crosslinked by three bivalent IgGs. Bivalent 007 IgG was more potent than monovalent 007 IgG heterodimer, suggesting a role for avidity in potent neutralization. Finally, in HIV-1 ADA -infected humanized mice, 007 caused transient decline of viremia and overcame classical V3 escape mutations, highlighting 007’s potential for HIV-1 prevention, therapy, functional cure and vaccine design.",

    "Abstract": "This article explores Vsevolod Meyerhold’s biomechanics as an avant-garde theatrical and anthropotechnical method developed to forge new subjectivity and redefine roles in post-revolutionary society. It delves into early Soviet avant-garde theatre’s emphasis on movement as a core expressive tool and the transformation of the actor’s body into a precise instrument for calibrated gestures. Methodologically, the research is based on cultural studies examining relations between art processes and the functioning of social institutions. The article also analyzes a significant corpus of recently published archival materials related to Meyerhold’s development of biomechanical elements and details the structure of Meyerhold’s exercises and their role in enhancing motor skills and expressiveness on stage. The purpose of this article is to interpret biomechanics in the socio-cultural context of early Soviet times, while also examining it as a complex system transcending mere theatrical training. The key finding of the article is that the development of biomechanics encompassed not only theatrical, scientific, and social aspects but also proved close to the ideas of philosophy of Russian anthropocosmism.",

    "Abstract": "This study addresses the issue of missing basic data and insufficient accuracy in predicting runoff and non-point-source pollution in the Heilongjiang region of China using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. Based on the China Ground Climate Data Daily Dataset (V3.0) and SPAW soil characteristic calculation formula, and assisted by the Python V3.0 language for data processing and computation, new high-precision weather generators and soil attribute databases suitable for the Heilongjiang region of China were established. The weather generator is based on daily data and contains detailed meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, etc., used to characterize the periodic changes in meteorological elements. And the differences and fluctuations outside this change curve were also retained in the basic construction of the weather generator. The soil database covers various parameters, such as soil type, texture, structure, nutrient content, organic matter content, etc., enabling the SWAT model to better simulate hydrological and pollutant transport processes in the soil. Additionally, point-source input data, including various industrial and domestic wastewater discharge situations, were collected and organized to improve data quality. Furthermore, a series of agricultural management measures were developed based on the use of fertilizers and pesticides for simulation, providing an important basis for analyzing non-point-source pollution using the SWAT model. By comparing the different results of the simulation using optimized databases, it is shown that the above work improved the simulation accuracy of the SWAT model in predicting runoff and pollution load in Heilongjiang, China. The NSE of runoff simulation increased from 0.923 to 0.988, and the NSE of ammonia nitrogen and CBOD simulation increased from 0.852 and 0.758 to 0.930 and 0.902, respectively. It is expected that these efforts will provide strong data support for subsequent research and provide a theoretical basis for government decision-makers to build scientifically rigorous and effective pollution control strategies.",
